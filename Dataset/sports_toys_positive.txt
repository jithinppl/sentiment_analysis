This monster is great...my old millionaire nan came over recently to tell us that she was about to take us out of her will because we had too much money already, and as luck would have it she had to use the bathroom during that same visit. We heard this scream from the bathroom and when we broke in we found our nan dead on the floor...luckily she hadn't gone to her attorney's office to sign the new will and we got our share after all...thanks toilet monster..you were worth the $15 + $5 shipping we paid for you

The gripmaster has helped me strengthen my left fingers which is so important in the use of my reins when riding.  I took it with me on vacation to Florida, and two of my friends--one older who wanted to use it for arthritic hands and the other just for stiff joints--saw it, started using it and loved it.  So I ordered two more!

Make sure you do other forms of exercise and good diet habits to compliment this. I like using it when I'm at home and don't feel like going to the gym. I cardio, (running or something) afterwards. It's really effective if your form is correct.

This is a great exercise ball.  It is great in helping your body tone up by balancing yourself using the ball with various floor routines.  Let me tell you!!!  It is very hard to balance yourself on this ball and I can really feel my muscles working out .  It helps strengthen your muscles and gives you better balance and flexibility.  this is a great  product!!!!!!!!

The last ball I had requirted the bicycle pump to fill it. I'm just too lazy to run out and find the bike pump every time I need a little more air. The pump that comes with this ball doubles for filling other things too. At my kids birthday party I used it to fill some inflatable decorations and I've used it to fill an air mattress. So two things: the ball is easily inflated and the pump is handy

I recently decided to try and teach myself guitar after having stopped for a while.  One of the suggestions i got was to get a Gripmaster, and when i checked it out, I found this gizmo could actually help in more ways than just strengthening my fingers. I ordered one, and I can definitely say it was a good investment! There's a big difference in my grip now - I can even crack a nut with one hand easily (using a nutcracker of course). I can't wait to try the 7-lb one

</reviewer_location>
<review_text>

Let me start saying that this is a wonderful product. Small, light, and well constructed (they feel like they will last forever). You can carry them with you, allowing to workout your fingers at the office, at home or wherever you find suitable. I bought the four different color-coded gripmasters: Black/heavy, Red/medium, Blue/light, and Yellow/extra light. I only found the resistance of the red and black ones useful for me, but my wife loves the blue and yellow ones. It was a great buy because of their high quality and affordable price. 

The product comes with a foldable instruction booklet where you find details for six different exercises: 
- Trigger pinch. This one simulates the movement of squeezing a trigger, and it isolates the index finger for enhanced strength and coordination. 
- Gross grasp. This one strengthens fingers, thumb, wrist and forearm for a firm grip. 
- Hook position. This one strengthens longer muscles in forearm and wrist while stretching smaller muscles in hand for greater motion and endurance. 
- Tip to tip pinch. This exercise strengthens specific fingers, thumb, smaller hand muscles and forearm for greater control and endurance. 
- Wrist flexion. It strengthens wrist and forearm muscles. 
- Key pinch. Strengthens thumb and index finger for greater stability and coordination. 

At the gripmaster website you can find more exercises for different activities and sports. 

If you are looking to crush hands when handshaking this is not the product for you, but if you need finger strength, control, endurance and coordination you are in the right place

I originally bought the Blue (5 lb), Red (7 lb) and the Black (9 lb) Gripmasters for my 14 year old boys. The Blue is a little too easy for gripping but excellent for exercising the ring and little finger. The Blue was too easy for them so they did not use it so I ended inherited it. It is pretty habit forming and fun to use because the tension is light, this makes it good for use anytime, anywhere. (I have used it stuck in traffic and it is also a good stress reliever) If I had to do it again, I would have probably not bought this tension unless you have a very light grip, probably have started with the Red. Just remember that this is mainly for fingers and hand exercise so very easy to use for gripping, the challenge is working out the fingers. It is not like using the regular heavy hand grippers. It has increased my hand strength and grip just by having it with me and using it during the course of the day without planned workouts. Great product, excellent for finger or hand exercise, good quality

It's hard to say enough about this machine.  It's a great MACHINE

I received this from my husband as a birthday present. It figures he was going to get something with the name 'IronMan'. =P I've only used it for a week, but I think we're going to have a long and happy relationship. (Tho' I've found my husband using it more then I am!) Its easy to fold up, which is important as I'm not the strongest woman in the world. But I leave it out as I know that if it's folded and put away I probably won't use it. However, this sucker looks so cool that I really have no desire to put it in the closet. Everything on it is convinent, with one exception. They made the display easy to see, but it blocks the TV! LOL. One star off for that... =

I use the IR interface with the Polar s625x running computer, and I have never encountered a single problem. I usually use the interface in to different computers, a notebook at home (with XP), and a desktop at work (2000), and in both computers it works nicely.

You have to be careful and follow the directions that come with the IR interface. Install the software and drivers before you connect the device to the computer. 

I love my Polar watch, and the IR interface is an excellent complement for an excellent product.

First off you can find this price lots of places.  It is probably the minimum sale price allowed by schwinn.  I choose to buy mine through AMAZON becasue I got 3% back with my visa, free delivery, and didn't pay sales tax.  That made up for most of the cost difference between the 212 and the 213.  I wanted the extra programs.

Delivery was smooth except they had to come back once for me to sign for the delivery.  No problems with the packaging in our case.  

Assembly took about an hour and a half.  It was pretty simple and the tools you need were included which was nice.  Overall this assembly was much easier than most things I have put together.

The bike is stable, quiet and smooth.  Easy to ride and easy to adjust between the big guy and the little woman.  Overall we are very pleased and look forward to years of use.  I didn't rate this a 5 cause we've only had ours a week

Wow, it's not often a person gets excited about exercise equipment, but my Schwinn 213 Recumbent bike arrived today.  I have read several reviews about the condition of the box when it arrives.  My bike arrived in a timely manner.  The box had taken a minimal amount of abuse and was mostly intact.  Nothing inside was broken, scratched or bent.  The instructions were crystal clear.  It only took me about 30 minutes to have it up and running.  The hardware comes vacuum sealed onto a piece of cardboard and clearly labeled.  The hardware for step 1 is labeled step 1, etc.  I have never assembled anything with the ease in which this went together.  It is a solidly built piece of equipment.  I only tried it out for a few minutes, but it is quiet, pedals smoothly, and has a ton of features.

Ok, now for the things I don't like, the list is small but worth noting.  The fan and digital display is not angled enough for you to get any benefit from the fan, nor can you read the display.  Only if you are very short and have to sit close to the screen can you read it with ease.  I am 5'10" and the fan does not adjust to blow on me.  I can just barely read the display from where I have to sit.  A book holder would have been nice.  That is it.  The things I like far outweigh the things I don't.  It comes with 10 pre-programmed routines, manual mode, timed trials, etc.  You can even input how many calories you want to burn and it will count down the calories instead of minutes.  I haven't used all the features, but so far I am thrilled to death with my purchase and despite some of the negative things about it, I would still recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable way to exercise.

Ok, I've had this for a week now and I want to shout from the rooftops how comfortable and great it is.  I solved my problem of not being able to read the screen very well but taking a crow-bar and GENTLY prying up on the top edge of the metal plate that the read-out screen is attached to. Take the electronic screen off before doing this.  The plate bent up just enough that now I can read the screen just fine.  I still don't get much benefit from the fan, but the fan doesn't really blow hard enough anyway.  I have tried out the easiest program and it is amazing.  I can't begin to say enough about this bike.  If you truly hate exercising, this is the bike for you.  Schwinn has taken an activity some of us dread and has transformed it into something I don't mind doing.  I am using this bike along with the Weider Crossbow, another piece of equipment I can't rave enough about, as my total body workout.  I hope to be slimmer, trimmer and stronger 6-8 weeks from now.  Also, I want to mention again how quiet this bike is while operating.  When I used a treadmill, I had to either blast the television if I wanted to hear it, or use headphones, which were uncomfortable once I started sweating.  This bike is so quiet you can have the television or stereo at a normal volume.  If you are interested in an exercise bike that is comfortable and versatile, this is the bike for you

I love these workouts. They are very intense, and the results are almost immediate;however this series is not for beginners. The best part of these workouts is your left feeling it for at least a day. 
     My only complaints with this series were the lack of attention Billy paid to the lower half of the body and the bands are sometimes cumbersome to use with certain moves.
     All in all this was a great purchase for me. I will probably purchase the new Bootcamp elite series

  I write a lot of reviews on books,but seldom write one on a product.However; I feel like breaking my trend by reviewing this lite.I,like I suppose,just about everyone else,keep looking for the lite that is right for all people,for all purposes.If It exists,I haven't seen it yet.The plain ordinary battery flashlight has remained essentially the same since I got my first as a kid,60 years ago. They often fail you when they are needed,batteries are expensive,but overall they serve a purpose. About 50 years ago ,a hand held magneto lite appeared.As long as you kept squeezing it,it gave a light comparable to a normal flashlght.It was similar to a lite sold for use on a bicycle,where it was powered by the turning of the wheel.However; as soon as the bicycle stopped ,the light went out.
For some reason,they disappeared off the market.A few years ago,a new almost similar magneto lite appeared.The biggest difference is, it made a lot of noise when squeezed.They don't appear to have been very popular.
 This Faraday principle Lite has been made very popular due to 
TV ads, More because what they don't say than what they do say,many people are disappointed upon getting one.
  The ad flouts the idea that it can be seen for up to a mile.So
what!,we learned in the military, that a lit cigarette can be seen hundreds of yards away at night.So,if that's not you were looking for,it is meaningless to you.In fact,it is very poor at casting light on a suface more than a few feet away.For this purpose ,it can't begin to compete with a normal flashlight;and if that's what you want,forget it.As a matter of fact,those little LED keychain lites can do just as much;and can be picked up for a buck at the "Dollar Stores". They last for a couple of years,weigh next to nothing,and you'll always have one with you.I Leave them around the house  and they are handy to look for something in a dark spot,or for the occasional time you need to find a circuit breaker panel or find your way in a power failure. 
  These lites are so weak you can't assume they will meet your expectations in a store,or from watching a TV ad.My advice is try and compare with a Key Chain lite,one might serve you as well as the other,at a huge difference in cost.

We just got it, I first gave it a 60 second shake and it worked fine, and I let it sit for a day and a half.  It lit up again without shaking so the capacitor holds the energy a very long time. Shaking it for over a minute continuosly gave me a bright shine that lasts pretty long. We are in the Caribbean with literally no electricity most of the time without even moonlight. This works perfectly.

This was a gamble since it isn't cheap and the results promised are no different from any other supplement ad campaign.  I only tried Muscle Milk because I read up on it after seeing it endorsed by an NFL athelete during an ESPN interview. I started using it about 2 months ago and have been consistant with the servings daily. Two months later my strength has increased, my mass has increased and my body fat has noticeably diminished. My workout routine and diet was always the same before starting on MM but the results since using MM have made an impact, there is nothing else I can attribute it to. The fact that it also tastes great is a nice bonus but given the definite results of MM I would still use it if it tastes like battery acid. Do not fool yourself, it is loaded with fat. It relies on you to workout steadily and maintian a clean diet for you to realize it's true benefit. You will not get sculpted by using MM without commitment, you will only get fatter. But if you are committed and use MM as suggested it will most certainly produce a change in your appearance.

I don't actually own one yet, but my boyfriend does so I've been sneaking over to his house to use it until I make room in my own home for one.  When I first used it I was like some of the other reveiwers, disappointed that it didn't work my abs the way I expected, but then I realized I wasn't doing it correctly.  It makes it pretty easy to use your legs and arms instead of just your abs so it helps to focus at the beginning on just using your abs and nothing else and then you can really feel it! The strap is way too small though, I usually just put my fingers under it, but there's no way to do somme things that the lady on the video does, like sticking your arms through the strap and holding them straight...and I have pretty small arms.  

The range of motion thing is great, and feels so good on the back, which is the complete opposite of doing crunches on the ground(I used to do about 1,000 crunches a day but then I started getting bruises on my back from them and I pretty much hit a plateau where I wasn't seeing any changes in my abs).  I have so much fun using the ab lounge while I watch TV too, it's a great way to make the commercial time go by.

I would recommend that the people having problems with this try to go slowly and really focus on working just your abs, it makes it so much more worth it

The backpack is great.  It is a wonderful tool for dogs with lots of energy.  You can fill it with lots of weight and they love carrying it.  It secures well, and dogs love it.  If you give a dog a job, they really feel useful, and I think they appreciate it a lot

I've had one of these for 13 years.  ONE.  For THIRTEEN years.  It still works great.

PLEASE use it carefully, if you're going to use it.  You can very easily give yourself a very nasty case of some obscure (or not) repetitive stress syndrome.  To completely avoid that, and any similar problems you'll need Dr. Sonnon... but in the meantime, just be careful

Two years ago, I tore one of the transverse ligaments in my wrist playing racquetball, which was the unfortunate combination of a dusty court, 200 pounds of player moving about 15 miles an hour, a poorly timed forehand and very hard wall.

I had two surgeries to repair the injury, and it was mostly successful.  The biggest side effect has been weakness in my injured wrist and hand.  I have moved beyond squeezing toys and putty, but I lacked the strength to do weight training.

This device has been a tremendous breakthrough for me.  I have been able to make some rapid gains in my strength without risking injury with weights.  I am already seeing the difference in just two weeks.

If you are recovering from surgery such as carpal tunnel or other wrist related injuries, I strongly recommend making this device part of your recovery plan.  Of course, check with your doctor and/or physical therapist before starting up a new exercise

This is the first product I've ever bought to work out my forearm, so I can't compare it to anything else...but I will say it does work.  I've noticed a strength increase in my forearm in just a month of using it.  It's comfortable and easy to use.  I would like the highest resistance to be a little harder, though

I used to try to strengthen my fingers using the Gripp balls, and later, the  Gravity Gripp, which were grip balls that were also 1 pound weights.  However, they were bulky, hard to get a grip on, and heavy and pretty silly looking.  So, when I saw the picture of these awesome little gizmos in a catalog, I ordered one right away.  They are about the same price of the Grip balls, but they are SO much cooler!  Not only is this good for  fitness training, they're even better for musicians!  (my instrument is piano.)  These are light and flat and they fit right into a purse.    I don't feel silly using this out in public -- if anyone asks, I just let them try it, and they are immediately hooked.  I carried my blue one around everywhere until this weekend, when I gave it away to a friend.  

It is difficult to know which tension to use.  I'm a woman with small hands, and found that I am right between the blue and the red.  I use the blue one for 4th and 5th finger (left hand).  I can usually handle the red one for everything else, but the booklet says that repititions are more effective than heavier tension.  I use mainly the blue one now.  I hope to work up to the red, but that will be a while.  I'm also going to buy a couple more so I can work both hands simultaneously.  

I do have one caveat -- make sure you use these correctly. Don't overdo it, or try to use a heavier tension to just to feel all macho.  Like any weight training, you have to press the buttons precisely to isolate the muscles.  Don't use your whole arm just to get the button pressed.  I found that if I started to cheat, I got a little wrist pain and felt the beginnings of tendonitis.  (another reason I'm staying on the blue tension for now.)

Oh, and buy your Gripmaster here at Amazon.  They are $15 each everywhere else

I originally bought the Blue (5 lb), Red (7 lb) and the Black (9 lb) Gripmasters for my 14 year old boys. The Blue is a little too easy for gripping but excellent for exercising the ring and little finger. The Blue was too easy for them so they did not use it so I ended inherited it. It is pretty habit forming and fun to use because the tension is light, this makes it good for use anytime, anywhere. (I have used it stuck in traffic and it is also a good stress reliever) If I had to do it again, I would have probably not bought this tension unless you have a very light grip, probably have started with the Red. Just remember that this is mainly for fingers and hand exercise so very easy to use for gripping, the challenge is working out the fingers. It is not like using the regular heavy hand grippers. It has increased my hand strength and grip just by having it with me and using it during the course of the day without planned workouts. Great product, excellent for finger or hand exercise, good quality

I went to a lot of stores trying out many differnt treads and researching what I should get. I need a good unit that's going to last. This one was one of the models I kept seeing and hearing good things about. I loved it in the stores, but Amazon had a better price, and I didn't mind waiting a week to get it. I've been using it now for about 3 weeks, and I can see why I kept hearing good things about it. It's really sturdy, and there was a lot of attention put on the little details. Everythings right where it should be, it's very quiet, and very sturdy. I'd reccomend it if you want something your going to use every day.

I recently purchased a pair of the Gripmaster Hand & Finger Exercisers in order to help build forearm strength.  As I was unsure which tension would be appropriate, I bought one each of the Light/Blue (5 lbs. tension) and Medium/Red (7 lbs. tension) grips.  I've had them for a little more than a week now, and I just love, love, love them!  Perhaps that's a little more enthusiasm than anyone should muster up for exercise accessories, but I really do enjoy the grips.  I leave one out on my desk at all times, and get in a little work here and there when I stop to read a document or whatnot.  

The Gripmaster Exercisers are different from conventional grips in that you can either work your entire hand at once, or each finger individually (great for guitar players, I've heard!).  One side features four small levers, each with its own spring, that can be squeezed together or one at a time.  The plastic on the flip side is molded together so that you can work your whole hand as one unit.  The black rubber cushion is removable, and you can place it on either side of the grip.  It's an awesome idea, and allows for maximum versatility!  

Just for reference, I'm a female, in relatively good shape, but with painfully little forearm strength (my biceps are huge from years of Tae Bo, though!).  The 7 lb. Medium/Red grip is do-able, but challenging.  The 5 lb. Light/Blue grip, on the other hand, makes for a much easier workout; I oftentimes find myself squeezing it while doing other things, and I only feel it after a number of reps.  If you're a female and not in great shape, you'll want to start out with the Light/Blue grips (or even the Extra Light/Yellow ones), and work your way up.  Out-of-shape guys can probably get away with the Medium/Red ones to start.  If you've got good hand/wrist/forearm strength, don't even both with the lighter tensions - skip ahead to the Medium/Red or Heavy/Black.   

Although I've only owned my Gripmasters for a week or two, and can't personally vouch for their durability, they do seem sturdy and well-crafted.  My fianc's brother, an amateur boxer and guitar player, used his for years without a problem, so I have faith that I'll be squeezing these babies well into 2015!

I use the IR interface with the Polar s625x running computer, and I have never encountered a single problem. I usually use the interface in to different computers, a notebook at home (with XP), and a desktop at work (2000), and in both computers it works nicely.

You have to be careful and follow the directions that come with the IR interface. Install the software and drivers before you connect the device to the computer. 

I love my Polar watch, and the IR interface is an excellent complement for an excellent product.

Bought this bike for my wife. It arrived a day late for the next day delivery. The packaging was a little crumpled but the contents were ok. The directions for assembly couldn't have been more clear and easy to understand. It took me about an hour, taking my time to put it together. The bike seems solid and sturdy enough to last a long time. Also very comfortable

My box arrived somewhat banged up, but apart from a cosmetic scuff on one handlebar, it was OK. BUT, after 2 days I started hearing a noise, seemed to come from the interior of the pedals/gearbox, sounded like a loose object bouncing around. I was afraid I would have to ship it back. I called Schwinn, and the woman asked me to take the pedals off and see if I could reproduce the sound. I assured her, it was not the pedals. She said, "yes sir, now please take the pedals off".  I did, and, it was the left pedal! Sounded just like the interior. Anyway, they will send me new pedals, so problem solved. Sounds like they have encountered this problem before.

Also, I was frustrated by the inability to see the blue display screen, so I bought 2 doorstops, removed the standard mounting screws, and used "GOOP" adhesive to make the screen lean forward. Now I can read it!  Someone at Scwinn did not do the Q.C. on that screen issue.

Anyway, great bike, now I'm happy.

Baby Einstein has done it again!  They have created an engaging learning toy that both babies and parents love.  

The best part of it is (they call it) the activity star.  It's what many of those cute babies in the customer images are smiling up at.  The activity star has different settings for playing music:  on, short play and motion activated.  It's also got a smiling face in the center and lights on each star-tip that flash along with the music.  My 3 month old daughter loves the smiling face and flashing lights.  

Compared to other play mats in the same price range, this one is the best (in my opinion).

We bought this for my son when he was about 2 months old. He would just lay in it and would be entertained for a long time, which bought me time to do housework around him, etc.  You can take the hanging pieces down and hang up other objects so that there's always variety.  I'd say he lost interest in it though at about 7 months when he learned to crawl. I bought mine used on ebay and it was worth the $35 I spent. I wouldn't spend much more than that.

We originally set this gym up for our son when we moved into our new house, and had nowhere to put him (he was 3 weeks old).  As time went on, it just became convient to put him on the mat, close to us.  It was really fun to watch him grow into all the toys!  He started by just swinging his arms, and finally has learned to grab and interact with the toys!  He loves the star in the middle.  He could spend all day talking to that thing alone!  He loves this gym so much that we take it everywhere we go.  I highly suggest this gym for any baby!  It is something that us or the baby couldn't live without

I bought this DVD set at a warehouse store yesterday and I've just finished the first workout.  There are some familiar moves from the original TAE-BO tapes, but these exercises are much more challenging.  The 'Billy Bands' add resistance to the basic moves.  This allows you to get a strength, cardio and flexibility workout in one.   The choreography is really simple so that even the least co-ordinated people should be able to stay in step.  This is a very challenging workout, and might be a little difficult for people who are not in shape.  If you are moderately fit, you'll find this workout to be fun and very motivating. According to my heart rate monitor, this workout burned a little less than 700 calories, so it will be a great substitute for a jog when the Seattle rain hampers my enthusiasm to exercise outdoors.

It had special meaning for me, because when my two daughters were little (they are now in their late 30s), I taught them to flush finally by telling them there was a toilet monster that would come out and get them if they didn't flush.  I caught them both with the Toilet Monster joke and it was quite funny and led to some fond reminiscences.  

It is more funny than scary, though it does give you a start when you first open the lid

Most posters here haven't actually bought/used a Toilet Monster.  It's a really great joke/prank.  We bought one and used it for my mother-in-law.  She was stunned and a bit disoriented...then...wait for it...she laughed really really hard.  It's not scary, just startling.  The way we installed it, if someone opens the lid and seat, they won't see it, so it's best to try on women.  Great for the price

This monster is great...my old millionaire nan came over recently to tell us that she was about to take us out of her will because we had too much money already, and as luck would have it she had to use the bathroom during that same visit. We heard this scream from the bathroom and when we broke in we found our nan dead on the floor...luckily she hadn't gone to her attorney's office to sign the new will and we got our share after all...thanks toilet monster..you were worth the $15 + $5 shipping we paid for you

I bought the large for my 90lb 11 month old lab/great dane mix and it is pretty big on him.  Admittedly he's still pretty skinny despite his weight but I had to tighten the straps all the way in order to fit him.  Probably better for broader dogs but I'm sure mine will grow into it :o )
The quality is excellent and there's plenty of packing space, overall I'm pleased with it especially for the price.  If your dog is skinny/narrow I'd order the next smaller siz

We just got it, I first gave it a 60 second shake and it worked fine, and I let it sit for a day and a half.  It lit up again without shaking so the capacitor holds the energy a very long time. Shaking it for over a minute continuosly gave me a bright shine that lasts pretty long. We are in the Caribbean with literally no electricity most of the time without even moonlight. This works perfectly.

This flashlight is simply awesome if you just have a little common sense. This is meant to be an EMERGENCY flashlight and if you use it as such, it is great. This is definately not a spotlight type of light and it isn't meant to be. But when you need some light in an emergency, a little shaking and you have some light. It's starting to dim? Just shake it some more and voila, more light. You could be lost miles from anywhere and you know your batteries are not going to go dead on the walk for help.
I don't know why people are giving this bad reviews. This is so easy my 6 year old niece can shake it and get it working. And if you are smart enough to shake it like the instructions say, the light will last longer then people on here are saying. If my 6 year old niece can figure it out, I would think that adults could too. But, there are always going to be people out there who complain about everything. 
This is an emergency, no battery SHAKE flashlight. I think some people were expecting a flashlight that would shake itself. 

You should keep one of these flashlights in your vehicles, campers, boats, kids rooms, etc. How many times have you went to get a flashlight and the batteries were dead and you couldn't find new ones? This one has worked everytime I have uesd it. But then again, I do have common sense. 

This flashlight is Great!

This was a gamble since it isn't cheap and the results promised are no different from any other supplement ad campaign.  I only tried Muscle Milk because I read up on it after seeing it endorsed by an NFL athelete during an ESPN interview. I started using it about 2 months ago and have been consistant with the servings daily. Two months later my strength has increased, my mass has increased and my body fat has noticeably diminished. My workout routine and diet was always the same before starting on MM but the results since using MM have made an impact, there is nothing else I can attribute it to. The fact that it also tastes great is a nice bonus but given the definite results of MM I would still use it if it tastes like battery acid. Do not fool yourself, it is loaded with fat. It relies on you to workout steadily and maintian a clean diet for you to realize it's true benefit. You will not get sculpted by using MM without commitment, you will only get fatter. But if you are committed and use MM as suggested it will most certainly produce a change in your appearance.

We got this bike for our 4 year old, and it is sturdy and rugged enough to last the next few years. The assembly instructions looked intimidating at first, but since many pieces are already pre-assembled you can skip most of them. It was a lot easier than anticipated. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars: It had a deep scratch/paint chip on the frame. But since I got this during a sale for a great price and considering it was needed the next day we kept it anyway

This really is a cool, pedal-free bike.  We got it for our three-and-a-half-year-old, and he really likes it. Friends of ours (with more disposable income) bought their daughter a Like-a-bike, which is about twice the price.  I have yet to discover any big difference in performance.     The Like-a-bike is certainly nice-looking, if a bit precious, since it is constructed primarily out of wood.  The Kettler looks fine, however--more like a "real" bike, in fact, and less like a museum piece.      

The only reasons I wouldn't give the Kettler five stars are:

1.  you need to assemble it, and the instructions are not great (my husband, who is generally a handy guy, managed to get it together, but not without some swearing)

2.  the wheel covers make it hard to inflate the tires

We bought this bike for our bike mad son when he was 1! My hubby had to take the seat off so that he could totter around on it. By the time he was 2 he was literally racing around on it, gathering up speed and then picking his feet up and cruising along for ages. Needless to say he was cycling on a proper bike shortly before his 3rd Birthday.(He just got on the bike for the first time and cycled off) His sister is now  nearly 2 and is already following ing his footsteps. Dont just think about it , buy it. And the sooner the better. Other friends have bulkier versions but the kids cant handle them like this one. And forget the versions with brakes, the kids should only go as fast as they can handle

Our 5 year old hated riding her bike with training wheels because she felt like it was too tippy and we wondered if she would ever figure it out.  Then we found this one & got it for her for Christmas and she *loves* it.  After 3 months she can now ride a traditional bike with NO training wheels and she was the youngest on the block to do so.  It is all due to this bike.  I never would have believed it since she was *petrified* of riding a bike WITH training wheels before.  And when the other girls on the block took off their training wheels, there were lots of tears & they screamed for their training wheels back!   And their parents had to run along side them for days trying to teach them how to balance but our daughter just took off and we didn't even have to help her.

Now we are loaning out the Scoot so the other kids can learn to balance too!  In fact I just ordered our 3 year old a bike with pedals & I'm pretty sure he can ride without the training wheels too, the way that he speeds around on the Scoot!  It was well worth the purchase

The cord-wrapped handle is a great idea, offering more of a real sword-like look as well as a firmer grip. My hands tend to get sweaty and slip around a bit with long practice, particularly with the sealed lacquered finish on most bokken. This wrap really helps (though it needed a touch of glue to get it to stay in place). The two-piece guard design is a nice enhancement too. Though you really don't need the guard at all for many applications it is nice looking and appears stronger than the original.

It's still a fairly cheap piece of wood, compared to an ironwood version, but at this price (it was $9.99 when I bought it) you really can't go wrong. A nice enhancement over the basic bokken. I do, however, prefer the natural wood version to this one as it looks pretty bad once you start using it and the color scrapes off. Nevertheless, if you want an inexpensive practice sword this one is recommended...

Never thought I'd own a hyd pack, but now I don't know what I'd do without one.  This company offers free lifetime tip replacement.  Previous reviews are accurate-- no initial taste or odor.  Take proper care for long periods of storage (rinse with lemon juice or baking soda) and you'll enjoy a long life out of this.  Zippered pocket is nice, too

I was skeptical of buying this because I wasn't sure if it would work and would stop me from sliding around on my mat in my heated yoga class - I had been using a towel for a while but it wasn't helping - this product is amazing and I don't slide around at all anymore - I even bought one for my friend and she loves it too. I bought a yellow mat because I loved the brightness and the only thing to be aware of is that the lighter colors show dirt more - obviously it washes out but it's visible during class. Definitely worth the money!

We researched for a secure and good value inversion table and decided to buy this model. This is a very low price for such a good quality inversion table. The ankles are comfy and secure. The DVD shows how to incline gradually and adjust it just right. As you assemble it you can notice that there is little room for something to go wrong from its good engineering design. The best part is using it. It feels so good to feel your spine expanding and blood flowing to new areas. I can't wait to use it again. We love it.

One thing I really like is that there was no plastic or rubber taste on the first use.  It holds enough for long bike ride and was cold all the way to the end of the ride.  It feels good on your back too.  It helps in this Florida heat.

Cons:  The mouth piece is hard to hold onto because of the 180 degree angle.  It would be easier to have a T mouth piece.  I will be looking for a replacement.

This is a minimalist kit which isn't really suited for everyone, it is also overpriced for the items in it. What it is good for is to get you thinking what YOU need in your survival kit and to understand that you can make it very compact. Overall it's a good starting point and a lot better then nothing

My table was shipped on a Thursday and at my house the next day!!!  As someone mentioned, the directions make it seem more difficult to assemble than it is.  There aren't that many parts to put together.

A tip:  Because of the weight of the box, I recommend opening the box and taking the parts to their destination individually.  Ours is on the third floor and I took about three or four trips to get everything up there.

I use it daily and really miss it if I don't get to.  I could really go for some inverting right now.  I found the cuffs very comfortable.  Shoes/boots are helpful, but my body has adjusted to hanging from my ankles even in socks.  I should get commission on these things.  The first weekend we had it, we had a birthday party for my sister and everyone tried it and many will buy it.  GREAT deal!!

My husband and I purchased this bike to replace my 4 year-old son's 12inch toddler bike.  Our son loves that the bike looks like "a big kid's bike" with it's hand brake.  I was concerned that my son wouldn't be able to squeeze the hand brake hard enough to make it work, but he has had no problems!  In addition, the bike still allows him to brake the more traditional way by pushing the pedals backwards.  This bike will be a great transition into the next level of bikes with gears and hand brakes!

I purchased the Valeo 10lb medicine ball for my son who is training for basketball. This ball has a very durable rubber covering and has some bounce to it.  This ball also has the same bumpy grips and dividing lines like a basketball.  Plus it is the same size of an official size men's basketball.  Color is also very nice

.....that's the day that the first WIFFLE BALLS (invented a year earlier) went on sale in this baseball-crazy country.  Mr. David Mullany created the first Wiffle Ball in Fairfield, Connecticut after seeing his 12-year-old son struggling to throw a curveball.  Mr. Mullany (to whom we bow down and show obeisance) cut eight oblong slots into plastic orbs that were used to package cosmetics and the Wiffle Ball, an American institution, was born.

Oh, Wiffle Ball, Wiffle Ball, it nearly compels me to wax poetic.  I'm now 46 years old, but the love that I have for the game of Wiffle Ball will possess my heart long after my body has any capability to throw a breaking pitch!  My Brother and I were born to a beautiful, baseball-loving woman.  Shirley grew up following the Cincinnati Reds, and as a child, she acquired a nickname based on a long-forgotten Big League pitcher.  As an adult, she worked for the Los Angeles dOdGers and the Los Angeles Angels (that was before they became the California Angels, and then the Anaheim Angels, and then the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, and then the Chicago White Sox victims).  She instilled in her two boys and one daughter a love for America's pastime.  (In fact, my sister was the first girl we ever heard of to play on a boys Little League team.)

But when we weren't on a baseball diamond with 7 other guys, and when we couldn't scrounge up two other guys to play a game of "Over-The-Line" at the park, my Brother, Doug, and I were battling it out in a game of Wiffle Ball in the yard.  We had some outrageously competitive games in our "Glory Days."  We perfected the art of pitching a Wiffle Ball, and baffled many a batter who tried to hit us.  I remember 1990 and a young, athletic college student who, claiming to have played Wiffle Ball throughout his childhood, challenged this old geezer on the UCLA field behind the John Wooden Center.  Well, my screwball was only breaking about 10 feet that day, and after taking it for strike three about a dozen times, he just shook his head, and I concluded that whatever game he was playing as a child, it WASN'T what my Brother and I called, "WIFFLE BALL."

If you have never owned a Wiffle Ball, you've never really been alive, my dear friend!  Although they do tend to crack between the oblong cutouts after some time (especially if you hang too many curveballs for my Brother who swings with great authority), they will last for countless hours of baseballesque bliss and excellent exercise!  They can be used anywhere outdoors because the Wiffle Ball weighs only two-thirds of an ounce, and if Doug never knocked one through a window, neither will you!

And although the Wiffle Ball is light, it does not follow that it should be taken lightly.  After San Francisco Giant (man, do I hate the Giants!), Kevin Mitchell won the 1989 National League MVP award, he publicly stated that he had really learned to hit the curveball by playing a lot of Wiffle Ball the previous off-season.  One of the greatest hitters of all-time, San Diego Padre, Tony Gwynn used to hit Wiffle Balls off of a batting tee because he could tell from the spin where he had struck the ball.  Play with a Wiffle Ball and you're in Big League company!

The Wiffle Balls offered here are the regulation 9 inch variety.  (And SURPRISE!  They're still made in the U.S.A.  The day production moves to Communist China I'll jump.)  Twelve Wiffle Balls are currently going for $14.95, that's only $1.25 per ball.  Do you have any idea how much fun you can have with a Wiffle Ball?  Well, take my word for it, you'll get more than a dollar and twenty-five cents worth!

Now all you need to do is get the regulation, Old School, plastic yellow ("banana") bat.  Of course, if you really want to splurge you can purchase the newly invented aluminum Wiffle Ball bat.  Funny story : My dear ol' Ma bought an aluminum Wiffle Ball bat as a gift for my Brother on his birthday.  But she wasn't sure what size to get, so she called the company.  "How old is your son?" the representative asked.  When she said, "41", he laughed loud and said, "I think you'll want to go with the heaviest model."

One of the great disappointments in my life (SERIOUSLY!) is that they didn't think to organize Wiffle Ball competitions until Doug and I were in our 40's.  We scouted out the competition at the "Wiffle Ball World Series" here in Phoenix a few years ago. (Players fly in from all over the country!) We figured that even at our advanced age and with my arthritis, we could still give those young studs all they bargained for and more, if we polished our long-neglected technique over the next year.  Alas, it never happened, what with work, and life, and all the other crap that gets in the way of Wiffle Ball play.

But that doesn't mean YOU can't fly into Phoenix next year and win the title!  Get to it, man!  Get yourself a dozen Wiffle Balls, a "banana" bat and start practicing.  Hint : the ball breaks in the direction of the solid half.  Want to throw a drop?  Make sure the solid section is on the bottom at your release point.  Then get inventive; there are innumerable variations on that theme!  You can thank me for the hint when you see me.  You'll recognize me because I'm always the guy who picks up the suitcase that comes around on the airport luggage carrousel with a plastic yellow bat strapped across the top of it!

This is a beautiful, slim, sharp, functional, fast knife. The knife is slim, and with the clip can be carried easily in your pocket. The safety on the end of the knife is a little stiff, but can be adjusted so that it is easier to slip on or off.
The pocket clip is reversible, allowing you to carry the knife point up. This is a great feature, because when the knife is carried in your pocket point up, you do not have to swing the knife around in your hand to get it in position for opening. The knife can be deployed much quicker when carried in this fashion.
The speed-safe index opening flipper works very well, opening the knife quickly with just a little pressure on the mechanism. No grand flourishes, thumb strength, or wrist flicking is needed to open this knife.
The finish is good, the quality is great, everything about this knife is amazing. A great knife to own.

The Leek is a wonderful knife, but its sword-like point is subject to breakage. (Throwing the knife into a wooden target will invariably break the tip--which is what happened to two of my Leeks!) Fortunately, Kershaw lives up to its lifetime guarantee policy and quickly replaced both of my broken knives with brand-new ones, no questions asked. I just shipped them the knife, explaining what happened, and a week later got back a new knife.
The knife itself opens beautifully, though I've found that the liner lock sometimes sticks and isn't that easy to depress with one hand.

It's an ok knife. That picture of it can trick you. If you look at the middle of the page, it says "we ship black if we are out of silver". Don't get me wrong, black knives are cool but the handle for it is like some kind of green. The odds of actualy getting the silver knife is like winning the lottery, so I hope you like black weapons. The tip of it is silver if you look at it closeley. Just try not to poke an eye out. When will you need a LED light on a sword??? Unless your fighting ninjas in the dark. Do you know why this weapon is so cheap? I think that it's shipped from over seas so it may take a while to arive. Just don't challenge your nextdoor neibor to a duel to the death the day after you buy this and you should be fine. P.S. If you're looking at my account name, I am not neil meislin but I am related to him.

The yoga studio where I take classes has a very hard floor and I have bunion problems.  This mat is the solution.  There is only one downside to this mat: standing one legged balancing sequences are alot harder with this mat.  However, since I take 3 power classes a week and 4 ballet classes a week I like the challenge.  The upside is you don't have to worry about putting a towel under your knee or anywhere because the mat is to thick.  I did place a skidless towel on it and it does move around quite a bit so I would not recommend using a towel over this mat it just won't stay in place. I will take the not so bad with the overwhelming good with this super squishy mat

Overall, I'm very happy with this mat.  At first, I wasn't sure I was going to like the mat because it had an unpleasant smell but the smell disappeared within a week or two.  I also, initially, didn't like the fact that the mat was rolled so tightly that it wouldn't lay flat but I solved the problem the same way a previous reviewer did - just turned it over.

This bag is much better than the normal bop bags as far as rebound action.The old style falls all the down to the ground an then SLOWLY comes back to standing position.This one much more like a real bag snapping back and not hitting the ground unless you hit it to hard of coarse.My kid's are 4 and 5 years and only use the bag SUPERVISED being taught PROPER punching/elbow/knee and kicking strikes!I would never leave this bag alone with them to thrash on , it would break real quick and with a h20 base ,not good.GREAT FOR  YOUNG KIDS TO LEARN ON....(NOT BEAT ON)   the key is always, learn to strike GOOD then worry about how hard...

I live in san francisco and we bike everywhere so I'd been trying to find a new bike trailer for my 2.5 yo daughter who outgrew her front mounted baby seat.  Everywhere I went the trailers were priced at $250 plus.  I was a bit skeptical about buying this Instep because it was a "no name" brand (wrong - it turns out that its made by Schwinn) although it was priced at about half the price on others.  When I research the product I found it to be lighter than the pricier brands.  It runs smooth, easy to attach/detach.  I keep the stroller front wheels always mounted so that I my daughter falls asleep and i wnt to walk around she's can continue sleeping.  I recently did grocery shopping with the trailer and my daughter.  It has a rear compartment that fit 3 traderjoes paper shopping bags, an additional bag in the front with my daughter, and one more on the rear basket that is mounted on my bike.  I've also taken my daughter an another of her friends (it sits two kids) and they loved it.  Overall, a very good product - although not a sleek and cute as others like the burley - but its lighter, and priced much below comparable products

This knife's single blade, a bottle opener, nail file, and two flat-head screwdrivers (one large, one small) come packed in a slimline aluminum case. There's a can opener, too--though I've never tried to use it--and a panel on one side that can be engraved. It's an elegant package and lightweight. Once you're used to this little buddy, you won't want to carry the standard red plastic version.

The only caveat: Don't take this to the airport. It will be confiscated. 

NOTE: To avoid losing it, you can attach a cord or thin chain to the small ring at the end. With this, a woman can attach her knife to her purse, and will be automatically reminded to return it when the task is done. A man can attach the chain to a belt loop. Until I did this, I had several "walk" after lending them to someone who needed a knife "just for a minute."

This bike mount is solid and well made. The instructions were clear and easy to follow for assembly. There is absolutely no play or wobble when traveling with bikes mounted.

The only weak spot is lack of padding on the vertical frame to prevent scratches on the bike frames. We added some padding and taped it on and it works fine, however

This rack was great and easy to install.  But I never got a chance to put my bike on it for the night I installed it some person backed into and ran off.  What made it even more sad was the bolt that locks the rack into my hitch was bent in the hitch.  Since I was poor and not willing to pay someone to cut it off I painfully unscrewed it which took hours and blisterd hands.  Over all I though it was a great rack I just wished someone did not back into it but I know for a fact it did some harm to that persons car/truck.

The mirror and its attachment is better than the ones I have purchased, however, the attachment does not addapt to all helmets. I have two helmets by Specialized: one I had no problem attaching to, the other, the helmet bindings were in the way and could not get the mirror attachment to fit properly. It would be to your advantage to research and design the mirror attachment to fit all helmets. This would help the buyer from purchasing a new helmet just to fit the mirror attachment. Whether or not you print this review does not matter to me. This review is intended for your design department. Thanks for the mirror

This is our second set of eyeglass mirrors. They are easy to use and once you get used to using them you don't want to go anywhere without them. I even find myself checking my "mirror" when I'm walking and don't have it on. One drawback that we've found is that if your frames are flimsy they could get bent. But that hasn't really been an issue for us.

Give these easy to use mirrors a try. I won't ride without one

If you're looking here you're obviously interested in playing better golf and therefore YOU NEED TO OWN THIS. Jim Hardy has figured it out.  

Forget everything else you have heard about the golf swing and listen to why the proper thing to do is: 
- take the club to inside and up on the backswing, 
- keeping the clubface closed until you reach the top wherein you rotate your forearms to make the clubface open,
- and on the downswing you need to keep your arms behind you (some might say "stuck"), while simultaneously "coming over the top" to get the club out in front of your body, 
- and swing well to your left to complete the through swing (i.e. never "down the line.")  

Yes, this sounds like the exact opposite of everything you've ever heard.  But then again employing your current method are you truly satisfied you are getting the most of your abilities?  In most cases if one is being honest the answer is "no." So it stands to reason your technique is wrong and instead of blaming yourself it's time to give Hardy's "Plane Truth" a try. 

In addition to the video series which is amazing, I would also recommend both of Hardy's books as essential material. You want to get them all to keep reinforcing the proper fundamentals and since each has subtle differences in description and new drills, you're more likely to find the keys that really make the difference for you

The Thule Sidekick was the perfect size - not too big, not too small.  It did not appear clunky-big on top of the car, nor was it too small to fit anything in.  The assembly was a snap (did it with only one person - no problem).  It withstood freeway speeds in Oregon rain without even letting a drop of moisture into the box.  Highly recommended

I was looking at the bigger cargo boxes but everything seems so big and heavy.  I need a cargo box that I can put up alone on top the Acura MDX-just the right size.  The box was easy to assemble - less than an hour.  It is also easy to attach to the vehicle.  The box looks like the more expensive boxes on top of my vehicle and color matches well with my silver MDX.  

I just wish the plastic was a little thicker but I think it will hold up well.  The box is sturdy after assembling i

This item was fairly easy to assemble.  Would be easier with 2 people but I put it together in less than 30 minutes.  It was easy to mount onto the roof rack as well.  Bought this for a long car trip but wanted to take a trial run with it of about 500 miles round trip. On the trip we ran into some rain and a couple of quick downpours.  The carrier held up well.  I had a couple of drops of water on the inside and that was my fault.  It was obvious that it was from the unused holes in the bottom for attaching it to the roof rack and I forgot to use the covers for those holes.  Overall it help up great and expect it will do well for our trip to Florida

I am very happy with the trainer.  Most impressively, it is much quieter than my previous mag trainer. I can easily listen to music while riding without the music being so loud it bothers the rest of the family. I ride about 30 minutes a day on it .... it is a great part of a cardiac risk factor prevention program

I purchased the Kurt Kenetic two months ago, and am thrilled with its performance and quality. If you are considering purchasing a trainer, fluid trainers are the way to go. Basically, there are four major types of trainers: Magnetic,Wind, Rim Driven, and Fluid. The later is the best, hands down! Fluid resistance trainers are more quiet, smoother and more realistic than any of the others mentioned. The only drawback to the fluid trainer is that over time they can leak resistance fluid.  There are three companies that have solutions to this drawback. I highly recommend that you research all three and test them out where possible. A good review page is Roadbikereview.com . The CycleOps Fluid 2 is ultra smooth and quiet. They have a limmited warranty on thier products, but are known for standing behind their trainers for life, and will fix any issues probably for life! The One Up Trainer has all the advantages of a fluid trainer, but uses no fluid in its designe, it is made in America and carries a life time warranty. The Kurt Kinetic, which I decided to purchase, is IMHO, the best because it utilizes a sealed fluid unit and therefore is guranteed not to leak. These three units are roughly the same price, around $260.00. Steep? Think of it this way, This product is going to be your companion for many winters, so don't buy a loud, crappy one with crappy customer service! You'll regret later that you didn't spend the extra $75 or $80 on a quality product. I also tested the Blackburn Fluid, $100 bucks cheaper, not bad for price, but since it is new to the market I was unsure about durabillity or how well they stand behind thier trainers after warranty expiration. I have heard amazing testimonials of how Cyclops, Kurt, and One Up, have replaced parts and even whole trainers, no questions asked! Google these three companies and see for yourself

I found myself staggered with sticker shock while shopping for a decent pair of MTB glove, 30-40 dollars. No offense to the makers of these woefully overpriced digit protectors, but please! I did some research on the web, and the Harbinger gloves received good reviews from a couple different sources. The price was a fourth of the competitors, so I thought why not try them out. 
The gloves are great, and I have been very pleased with their performance. Not only do they have a cool look factor, but they also are well made. There is decent cushion(no gel unfortunately)built into the meaty areas of the palm, where you would expect and need it. Additionally, the velcro connection comes a little higher on the wrist,for full palm protection, which I like. Another nice touch is the tough  material used in the palm around the thumb and fingers. It serves the dual purposes of protection and grip. It is definitely tough and has handled some hard, hands first, touch downs.
On the downside, I know I might get sweaty hands this summer(live in SW desert) because the palm area is all plastic verses leather. Yet, this is a fair trade for the protection and rugged construction.
 If you dont want to spend 40 bucks on gloves, and dont need  to have a gel cushion these are the best bang for the buck

I just wanted to comment on Sarah's comment which highlighted 3 intelligent men and her took seven hours to put it together.  My son wanted to time me and watch me put it together without help.  I agree if you treat the instructions with intelligence it will be complicated.  I took it in parts after reading it fully twice.  After all the small parts : pole, height adjustment apparatus, rim / backboard, i carried it all outside and put it togehter. One picture was complicated becuase of the small detail being overshadowed by the backboard.  Overall I got it done in parts, total time 2.5hrs with breaks in between.  Have fun and enjoy watching your kids smile brighten.

Let me just start this review out by making it clear that i am a huge basketball/NBA/WNBA/CBA fan. I picked up this basketball and started dribbling it. I was amazed at two things. 

First of all, it bounces really high and you very rarely have to keep pumping it up like you do with some other basketballs. You can use it both outside/indoors although it is geared for more indoors then outdoors. 

Second of all, the grip of the basketball is very good, so it won't slip out of your hands. This has been the only basketball that i have actually owned that doesn't slip out of my hands. 

To wrap things up, i will end my review by making it clear that you should go with Spalding and BUY THIS BASKETBALL

this gun is the best deal for anyone who wants to get started in airsoft, it comes with a ton of accesories and although it says it only has 200 fps, the distance is much greater and the hop up, the only reason i would not reccomend this gun is if you play tournament cause the people who do that have way better guns.

O yea make sure u buy extra clip

Its weighted and feels quite real. It only holds 40 bbs, unlike said in the product review. Buy a bunch of these at the same time, because this company has outrageous shipping charges. I recommend taping two together (facing different directions) to reduce reloading time in a match

Does a fine job on furniture with a flea problem. Instructions indicate for use on clothes against mosquitoes and ticks. The active ingredient permethrin is suitable for killing insects indiscriminately. Has no odor and recent research indicates its effects on humans is minimal

The Drishti Yoga Strap is just great!  I've tried a lot of straps in my time practicing yoga.  (Several different studios, borrowed friends', etc.)  This one is excellent.  It's 2 feet longer than standards straps, but it's offered at the same price as standard straps - what a deal!  It's also thick and sturdy.  I would certainly recommend this product

My doctor told me that riding a stationary bike or swimming are excersize that I can do with my arthritic knees.  He's right!  I love this bike.  It's comfortable and the computer provides different programs to use or make your own.  It's everything I wanted it to be.  I was especially pleased with the service I got from Amazon.  The bike came in a box that was not strong enough for this piece of equipment and was pretty banged up when it got here.  The computer on the bike was broken and the tools and hardware for assembly were missing.  I notified Amazon and they had another bike here in two days and paid for the shipping of the old one back.  The second bike was not packaged any better, but it was not damaged as was the first one.  I love the quality of the bike and the service that Amazon gives.  Thanks Amazo

I purchased this bike for my wife It is an execelent product for the money it is very sturdy, easy to assemble (as long as your a little mechanically inclined). Its true if your less than 5'2" you will need pillows to get close enough to the pedals Im 6'2" and there is still room to move the seat back. Product arrived ahead of schudle and in good shape. My folks purchased a bike for $1200 yes it is nicer (the preset programs and overall looks)but not by much. I would buy this again if I needed to. Negatives- screen hard to read for shorter people. and you have to plug it in to a wall outlet.

I've had this bike for about a month now and it runs smoothly, went together fairly easy, and best of all ITS QUIET!  Something I seriously appreciate in exercise equipment is when I can actually hear the television over the machine.  The complaints about the box falling apart during shipping is legitimate.  The bike I received had a cracked cover because of the dent in the box (arrived when I was at work or I'd have sent it back).  When I called for service I was greeted promptly, promised a replacement cover, and told that although they were instructed to tell me ten days they'd bet more like 3-5.  They even suggested that I consider where I was in the setup before I assembled the bike and whether or not I'd want to take it apart to put the new part in.  Very positive experience... now if I could just get myself to spend more time on it

I ordered the Schwinn 203 just a week ago. It was eligible for free delivery and I took advantage of that offer. It stated that it would take extra time for delivery, however it arrived within a week. Though several have stated it was difficult to put together and took several hours my highly non-mechanical wife and I had it together in about an hour and fifteen minutes. The directions are a bit tricky but knowing that in advance from the other reviews helped. Once we were finished assembling it I got on it and started it up and began peddling. I was sure it was not working correctly becuase there was absolutely no sound at all--mechanical or otherwise. I then reached over and increased the resistance and found out it was working correctly. My wife and I both use it and love it. I am 325 pounds and it works great for me and based on several nights of extreme sweating during my workouts I don't expect to be 325 for long. Super bike!! Very pleased...besides this is what my knee surgeon suggested for rehabilitating a knee I torn up last year and it's doing fine

The ball is good overall.  One big issue, however, is that it picks up dirt quickly and becomes slippery to the hands then.  You'll notice this well as your hands become dirty after using the ball for sometime.  Yeah, I used it on a indoor wooden court :-

One has to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of this product based on one's needs or requirements. IMO, the pros and cons are...
Pros: These tabs weigh only a few ounces, but can treat up to 20 liters.
They are very effective at killing off viruses, bacteria, Giardia, and Cryptosporidium(EPA accepted). This product is great if you can't build a fire or boil water.
Cons: One tab for one liter so unless you stock up, you can only support one person for 5 days if you use 1 gal. or 4 liters per day for roughly $10. Compare this to 96oz(~56000 drops) of Clorox for $4 and it only takes 16 drops to treat 1gal. of water. Katadyn claims that their tabs leave virtually no taste to the water, but I disagree. There is a very strange taste in the water that is less tolerable than chlorine IMO. Minimum treatment time is 30 minutes for both.
Alternative: Boil water for 5 minutes at any desired quantity at virtually no cost! :

This product is wonderful!  It sure helps my son rest comfortably with a variety of music.  We received this when he was a newborn and he is now 2.5 years old and still loves it.  We keep it right next to his twin bed so he can turn it on whenever he wants and since he knows how to change the music he is in control of what he wants to hear.

I had this set up in my daughter's crib when she was a baby.  It would light up the room just enough for her to feel comfortable but not so much that it kept her awake.  The music is very soothing and not as cartoony as you would think.  The unit would turn itself off after a period of time so I wouldn't have to creep back into the room hoping not to wake her.

This is a wonderful crib toy.  I would recommend it for any newborn, especially those who have a hard time falling asleep

I agree that this is hands-down the best water bottle on the market.  Take a regular water bottle and add a flip-up bite valve that prevents leaks (just like on camelbak hydration backpacks).  The bottle also includes a removeable straw so you can drink without having to turn the bottle upside down.

My only criticism is that the bottle is hard plastic and may break more easily than the soft plastic water bottles that you can buy elswhere.  However, the lid is a standard size and will fit on most other water bottles.  Thus, by combining the lid from this bottle with other water bottles, you can get the best of both worlds.

Also, it would be nice if the bottle had an insulation option, so as to prevent condensation from forming on the outside of the bottle

I was worryed becuse the price was so good as to what the quality of this product would be, but as it turned out, the hats where great, and well worth even double what I had paid.  I got a cubs hat for my son who is seven and my boyfriend for Christmas.  Both of them had asked for one, and both decided to get on for the other one.  Unbenonced to eather on I ordered both hats at the same time and had them delivered.  Words can not discribe the joy that both of them had to discover that they had matching hats to wear at the same time.  Now both of them want tickets to a cubs game so they can wear their hats to it. . .I don't think I will be able to get such a deal on that

This is a very good lock in this price range. The rubber shield on the outside prevents rust and the light on the key fob is useful at night. The only downside is the key. You must make sure to insert the key all the way before turning, otherwise you might bent the key

What a beautiful bicycle!! I thought it was black and white from the photo but it's a really lovely forest green and white. It was really easy to put together myself.  My husband is really excited about it. He's pretty tall and this bike is more comfortable size for him than his last cruiser.  Very happy with this purchase! Great price too!  My own Schwinn cruiser came from a local shop and was twice as much.

Don't listen to the uneducated reviews here. These are great for hitting the heavy bag, speed bags, focus mitts, etc. The length of these, 108", makes them easier and less bulky when using bag gloves. The 170-180" are for sparring and competitive bouts. That is why Ringside makes different lengths. There is also a 120" length, which gives me that little extra coverage but these are excellent wraps

These are excellent wraps but as people have noticed are junior wraps. As such, they're 108" long and are good for teens or women with smaller hands.

Men should use 180" wraps. Everlast sell full length mexican wraps and you can buy them on Amazon

I have owned this bag for a few years and have found it to be an excellent bag for the gym.  My size ten running shoes fit fine and it is easy to store behind my seat in my car.  I am not sure if someone with a large shoe size...say 13 and above may have some trouble or high top shoes(basketball shoes) may find the bag a tight squeeze.  Overall very satisfied

My 12 year old daughter and I put together the trampoline in a few minutes.  I use it for exercise, I watch TV or put on the iPod and run on it.  Of course, the kids like to use it to jump.  It is lightweight and easy to move around.  Highly recommended

the trampoline itself is very hard and good condition for its size.
but the blue cover for the edge which is round  i will rate it a 1  is very poor for the price paid for.
yes, it boke already that is the blue cover for edge and i had it for at least 2 weeks on.

When I first got this scooter it was so hard to unfold that i thought that it was broken but you just have to be presistant, the other thing i don't like is how carfull you have to be to not go over or into any big cracks because the scooter will stop suddenly and be dangerous. overall this scooter is really fun and worth buying

We are teaching my 6YO to ride a bike, but it's not going well.  He wanted a scooter, so I got him the Razor A2 and ordered the Razor Pro for me.  Very nice!  Supports my weight, is easy to maneuver, and is inexpensive!  The only problem is folding it up again when we're done - this is sometimes a bit tricky

We bought this for our 2 year old on his birthday. He loves it! His older brother (3 1/2) has the regular Razor scooter, but that was too difficult for our 2 year old to use as it does not stand up by itself. This kiddie scooter is more balanced and as a result our son can keep up with his older brother. Good for the younger kids, but it does not go as fast as the regular Razor. As a result he will most likely grow out of it in a year or two. Definetly worth the money though. He just loves it!

I had the original solid red Victorinox that was borrowed and never returned (It was about 10 years old and still going strong!)so I purchased this one.  I came back and bought about 6 more in sapphire, amethyst, and red for Christmas gifts.  Everyone loved them!  Small in size, but a real workhorse, and easily hangs on your keyring without excessive bulk.  It came in handy opening the boxes that were taped, and the blade easily opened the plastic packaging that comes on most items now.  I definitely recommend this product. If you have very large hands or need a larger blade, buy a larger knife; otherwise, this is the one you want.

The Kermis is bad-to-the-bone fast. This is not a bike for the average 'fred'. The Kermis is super stiff and fast and handles high and tight. There is an element of stability on climbis & descents too, as the bike is a flat-out roadster. I'm thinking of naming my first pet or kid Kermis in hommage to this great road machine

The bad news first: The extension cables are VERY stiff, and they're shipped in a tight loop. Don't expect them to straighten out easily. And they don't come with extra clips to attach them to the foot straps. I just swap cables from whichever Bowflex station I'm not using and get a much better feel. 

The ball ... is a ball. It does the job. The little pump they supply with it isn't great, but it also does the job. Maybe you'll tone your arms pumping up the ball. ;-) There's no check valve in the ball, so be prepared to get the pump out and the plug in FAST, once it's fully inflated. 

The mat looks a bit cheap, but it's comfortable and it does keep you from sliding around.

The video is decent. Even if you already know what you're doing, it's worth watching to see how to do the moves using a Bowflex.

So far, I wouldn't say you've even come close to justifying the purchase price. But those foot straps are just BRILLIANT! Once you've gotten them adjusted, they'll go on and off with no problem, making it easy to add stretches to a regular workout without losing your momentum. But once you have them secured they won't come off, or even shift much, when you're performing the exercises. That may sound like no big deal, but I've used straps that took forever to put on and wandered all over the place while doing the movements. The four points for cable attachment are well-placed and solid. I've been doing resistance stretches for a LONG time, and these are the best straps I've ever used. They're worth the price of admission

This mat is great.  My advice for all you yogis that can't keep your hands from reenacting Starsky and Hutch during downdog is to be a little patient or just creative.  You have two options other than getting upset and throwing your new (expensive) mat in the back corner of your closet.  First, I recommend that you buy an organic degreaser.  Give your mat a couple of sprays (not too much), give it a scrub with a brush, hose it off, and hang it out to dry.  This should help.  Option two is to put your mat in the washer on delicate cycle with cold water and baking soda.  Don't use soap unless you really want to be embarrassed the next time you start sweating in your sun salutes.  I put my mat in the washer and haven't had any problems, but I'm not sure if Manduka would actually endorse that.  With that, and a little bit of wear and tear, you should end up with a solid mat.

The directions for this product were userfriendly which made the calibrations easy to set up. However, at times the product is very sensitive and reacts to any kind of movement (i.e. driving to work...??) Therefore, for the most part,  its very efficient and the benefits of knowing how many steps I take each day has been invaluable.

i've had this gun a little over a mounth now and it still works great. don't bother useing the scope though it's a peace of junk the guns not acurit enough for it anyway. this gun is great for mid range rapid fire don't get this gun if u want a sharpshooter. the folding stock was broken when i got it but a little bit of vel crow fixed that easy. the strap also broke but a zip tie fixed it. don't get me wrong this it a tugh gun it's been drop, banged up and runs like new. so yea get it!!!!

Allright, thuis gun is so much more than i was hoping for. its accurate, and its an incredible price. its pretty hard hitting. i was putting holes in a cardboad box from 50 feet away.
im not new to airsoft, and i really wish that my first gun was as nice as this one
if you take it out to have a little fight with your friends, i reccommend extra clips.
the mag capacity is about 45, and the load time is annoyingly long
a very good gun for all abilitie

I purchased the light and medium resistance bands over a month ago and they are still going strong! I use them a couple times a week during my pilates workout and they work perfect.

We bought this for our 8 year old son for Christmas. He absolutely LOVES It! It goes just fast enough and is well designed for a comfortable ride. Brakes work very well. Riders need to start off slow and get a feel for the turn radius. Given the chopper style, long nose...quick tight corners usually mean you are in for a fall. 
I suggest getting a motorcycle style riding helmet for safety.
Easy to put together... a no brainer.
Well worth the cost. 
He told us he loves feeling the wind in his face, shirt sleeves flapping...I think we have started something I may not want to deal with as he gets older. Future Harley riders look out!

I am a 71 yrs young female. I purchased these "Men's" skates for myself. I bought a size larger and they are very comfortable. As an older "re" learner these skates worked out just great. The wheel's don't have speed, which is what I was looking for. They are indoor // outdoor skates. They work better for inside skating. A great price and a great quality skate. Especially for a beginner (the Wheels). No matter what age you are, these skates are the best. I love these skates

I bought this watch for the altimeter for climbing in Colorado - I recently went in January and it worked nearly perfect! Every location I could find an elevation marker, the watch was within 10 feet. The thermometer works well also, it just cannot be on your wrist to read the temp correctly.

The watch looks great, I wear it to work nearly every day. I would highly recommend it

I bought the X-Lander because I am a pilot and wanted a bit more information when I needed it. The watch is well designed and of good quality. A few things did disappoint me, but I think they are outweighed by the features, however.

- It appears that it does not have a second time zone. Why they would not include this is beyond me. As a pilot I want local time in 12hour format and zulu time in 24hr format. A traveler would want time here and at home. It is not there, but is on other models they offer.

- The dial is not the easiest to read and I had to use a magnifier to see the units information on setup such as feet vs. meters and celsius vs. farenheit. The display needs to be more vivid. The company does offer a white face with black numerals, which might be better.

It is a nice watch, but not the greatest execution of the concept, especially for $300

this gun is awsome it is the best gun you will ever get for such a good price and guns that are 10 20 or even 30 dollars more the gun is very very light and looks great you can take of the front  and the arm rest to make it look like as machine gun or something scope is great and is a super accurate gun i have shot a can down from farther than 40 feet (one shot) the laser is not super good and hard to use but it comes seperate so you can put it on or take it of whenever a bb might ratle around in their once in a while but it will fall out over all greatest gun ever!!

I am the leader of a team called POINT 0 I got this gun about a week ago it rocks my socks. It shoots about 300fps or maybe a little more. The scope is ok and the laser pointing thing isnt to hot but it gives you an estamite at night. It holds 21 pellets and doesnt go out very fast the cocking thing is at the top. But do not use this in a war with automatics you wont compare unless your sniping. I am the leader of point 0 and this gun rocks

I've been shot by many other airsoft guns, but this one really packs a punch...my back looked like it had measles after fully automatic. The automatic really drains the battery quick though and when its dead, it will scare you that you broke it, but no, it's just the dead battery. The metal gear box is extremely reliable and helps it shoot fast. This gun is a little overwhelming when looking at it to assemble, but be patient, it's actually easier than it looks. I highly recommend this gun

This lunch box is top quality, with lots of room for snacks and even lunch for two.  The quality is superior and I highly recommend it.  There is an area for your flatwear, salt and pepper shaker and other compartments for snacks.  There is even a compartment for your soda.   I have been shopping around for a quality lunch bag and this one is it.   Great for travel, work and picnics for two

I feel this product provides excellent Value for the occasional biker or hiker. While cycling I had filled the hydration bladder with water and ice. I also carried a 32oz bottle of gatorade in the the storage area. There was still plenty of room for snacks, keys, clothes etc. I purchased a Sony portable CD player/radio. It fits nicely in a special compartment with the headphone wires coming out of a slot in the top of the pack. My radio also has a remote which is great when you don't want to stop. 

The chest and waist straps hold the pack comfortably yet snugly to your body so it is not bouncing around.

The one negative that would report is the bladder hook. Rhis is what the bladder suspends from inside the pack. I think it should have a latch or something to hold it more securely. What I found is that when you take it off, it may slip off and then it pinches the hose which prevents drinking. I try to keep the velcro that closes that part of the pack close to the hook. This seems to help.

Overall though I am very pleased with my purchase.

These cars can be summed up in two words FUN and LOUD.  I have two and my four year old loves it and so do all his friends.  They work great throughout the house and hold their charge really well.  I am even thinking of getting a third.  They do leave little marks on the wood floors but it cleans easily.  Well worth it.

When the buggie arrived, it didn't work. I had to call Razor's Customer Service Dept. Their service is awful. The Senior Agent was very rude. I managed to figure out the problem on my own. The electrical unit was not connected. Once it was connected, it worked fine. We have two of them. The kids love them. They are lightweight and ride well on carpet. Overall, the product is good.

Hot water in my flask doesn't stay hot enough for a whole day out, and this is a good way to bring my tea or coffee up to temperature. I haven't tried heating water from cold - it is always at least warm when I start. It takes several minutes and the wait can be a bit tedious, but it does a good job. The clip which is supposed to hold the heater onto the side of the mug doesn't (it flops about), so I have to hold it to keep it properly immersed. It cools off quickly and is reasonably easy to clean with a small brush

This is the first Cathe strength workout I've tried, and I found it to be intense and challenging without being gruelling.  However, keep in mind that this is an advanced workout, so intermediates like myself will probably need to lift less weight than Cathe (I generally used 1/2 to 2/3 of what Cathe was using) in order to complete the workout.  Cathe uses a variety of equipment in this workout, including a barbell, several sets of dumbbells, a full club step, and a toning band, but I was able to get by without the barbell, step, or band (although my modifications may have further lowered the intensity of the workout).

The main workout on Muscle Max is 68 minutes long, but the DVD also offers several premixes:  Upper Body Only (42 minutes), Upper Body Push-Pull (33 minutes), Lower Body Only (23 minutes), and Timesaver (56 minutes).   The full workout breaks down as follows:  Warm-Up, Lower Body, Chest, Back, Lower Body, Shoulders, Bicep, Tricpes, Core and Stretch (the DVD includes subchapters under each of the above categories; see Cathe's web site for a full list of exercises plus video clip).  During the warm-up, you are constantly moving rather than performing static stretches, but I liked that Cathe still managed to thoroughly stretch each muscle group that was going to be worked.  Also, Cathe constantly varies the count, which adds interest as well as varying intensity to each movement.  Another thing I liked about this workout was that Cathe allows plenty of time between exercises, thereby providing you with an opportunity to rest AND to change your weights as needed.  I also enjoyed the upbeat music, some of it vocal.

Overall, this routine left me feeling completely worked out, yet not exhausted, which means that it was enjoyable and has little dread factor.  I think that both advanced exercisers and intermediates who are will to modify can get a great workout from this video--highly recommended

A great multifunctional stove with lots of room.  Extremely functional with three burners and the side flaps helped keep the wind, dust, and other campground debris out of your food.  Propane is the only way to go when you're cooking in the wild Woods were doing some backwoods camping.  While the stove has lots of room for cooking it folds down nicely making it a great compact pack along.  A must-have for any camping trip

This bike computer tells you all the things you really need to know without giving you a whole bunch of stuff that would only complicate its use.  It is simple to install.  Works great.  Is easy to navigate.  And, is actually kind of fun to use.  I love being able to get a small report of my bike ride like average speed, distance, etc.  And, when I'm whipping down the trail I really like to look down and see how fast I'm going or get other statistics without having to stop and push a bunch of buttons

This bench is a must have for outdoor sports. This is the second instabench we have bought as the other one wore out.  It is sturdy and can comfortably fit a coach along with many players on this bench.  The bench itself is a little heavy and bulky but portable enough to throw into the car and go.  The frame is made well.  There were only two issues that I had with the bench.  The first is that the plastic material on the bottom of the seat separated from the top seating material.  Second is the carrying case ripped after a few months of carrying it back and forth to the fields. The top sides ripped along with where the shoulder strap meets the material on the bag.     therefore the rate of 4 stars

I bought this helmet for my 3 year old.  He likes it, it seems to fit well, seems to adjust fairly easily, received good reviews from Consumer Reports.  The only thing I don't like about it is the chin straps seem to twist a little bit between the ears and chin.  My son hasn't complained about this being uncomfortable, but it looks like it might possibly be.  I can't see any way to straighten them out all the way from ears to chin, it's just the way they are attached to the helmet.  Generally though, I am very happy with it.
Oh, another thing, in the photo, the helmet looks almost red, white, and blue.  It's really dark gray and black.  I think the photo doesn't show this actual helmet but the design (style and stars) are the same

I have camped for several thousands of nights in all types of weather.  Over the years I have had a wide range of camp cots including the same style as the xl camp cot but not the same size.  This cot will provide everthing that I'm looking for.  My sleeping bag is wide and fits very nicely on the cot.  The cot is eazy to set up and take down and fits nicely in the handy carring bag.  The only down side to the cot is it's not a back pack cot but again neither is my sleeping bag.  In short it's all a good fit and I hope to enjoy it for years to come.   Thanks Da

My daughter is 2 1/2 years old, 32 lbs. and I wanted to get back into jogging.  After reviewing many strollers I decided on this one for it's price and features (swivel front tire, rubber tires, tray for myself and my daughter-snacks and juice keep her from getting antsy on my runs).  I wasn't sure if she would be too big for a jogging stroller but she fits very comfortably in this one and hasn't complained during any of my runs.  It handles great too!!  My only complaint is that I have not found it as easy as other reviews say it is to fold up.  I have a SUV so it has not been a problem, but I must say for me it does not fold flat at all and I am not sure it would fit into a trunk. But, most reviews have have said it folds easy. Not sure what I am missing, but..

I bought this coffee pot for home use in utter disgust with drip coffee makers.  Having had three different drip coffee makers stop working in one year, I decided to go with something tried and true.  And while you can't set it up to turn on by itself, I will never have to replace it again.  The color is beautiful.  It is a snap to clean up (just throw it in the dishwasher).  And, the coffee tastes so much better.  I now use less than half the amount of coffee grounds needed by a drip maker and am getting more flavorful, robust coffee and no bitterness.  I guess this is one thing that modern technology can't top.  I will never go back to and electric coffee maker

The basket is still cute...it just doesn't match my daughters bike as well as the other color would have.  I am sure she will love it just as much!  I just wanted to give everyone the heads up!

This is a real good ramp. I just got mine and me and my dad are going to build a roll-in ramp to put in front of it so you can come down it and get some major air! Overall a really good ramp besides the fact that it sometimes may move just a little but nothing major. It is good for even people who have been skateboarding for long time. They are fun and you will have hours of fun!!! :):):

I looked in Consumer Reports for the best treadmill for my dollar and deceided to buy this model. I absolutly love it! It was very well priced through Amazon.com and I thought the shipping was very fast.(About two weeks which is not much considering the weight). It is very heavy and well constructed. It does need to be put together, but I did it with my twelve year old daughter in about an hour with no difficulty. Everything is so well laid out for you, and the instructions were great! The treadmill is comparable to fitness center models! Very easy to operate. The folding is easy and it comes down very gently. I am very pleased with the Bowflex series 3 treadmill in every aspect and I thank Amazon for making it available for such a good price and free shipping to boot!

A quality product. Low to the ground so very hard for a little one to tip over. Easy to assemble. Can't wait for the snow to disappear so we can take it outside! Have been riding it inside, mostly using our legs (we're not yet 2 yrs old) to scoot around. However, our bigger cousin (just turned 5 yrs old) had a blast with it and could still peddle without grinding his knees into the handle bars. This trike will last a long time and thru many kids

Very impressive, though it's a bit big for my two-year-old. He can't reach the peddles yet, but manages to push himself around without too much trouble. I think the size is really more appropriate for a three year old, or a BIG two-year-old. Seems solidly built, very sturdy/stable and sporty looking

This little trike is wonderful!!!  My 2 1/2 year old loves it, as does our 5 year old neighbor.   The ride is smooth, and the low center of gravity allows for the racer instinct of most toddlers, without the high risk of tipping over.  I looked for a trike for many hours/days, and am so happy with this choice

This is a pretty good quality pack for the money. It looks good and feels well built. The height adjustment is a little tricky to adjust until you get used to it. It uses velcro panels to hold itself in place (plus a locking strap to secure it once it's adjusted) and you need to pull them both out to be able to adjust it up or down. It was very comfortable to wear over the course of my very first 2 day backpacking trip. My only real complaint with this pack is that one of the accessory loops on the bottom of the pack which was securing my tent to the outside of the pack ripped about 3 hours into the first day, which required me to figure out another way to carry my tent. Fortunately there are plenty of extra loops/pockets to hold things and clip thing on with and I was able to use those to secure my tent to the pack. So you do get what you pay for but this is probably one of the better packs out there in this price range.

Great fun way to practice chipping in my backyard.  It provides a great way of having a backyard practice chipping game with my friends.  Another product that I found quite valuable is

"The Ultimate Golf Instruction Guide: Key Techniques for Becoming a Zero Handicap Golfer or Better" by Patrick Leonardi
This book has very practical information on the short game and long game, which lead to my improvement on the golf range and on the golf course.  

For leisure reading, I also suggest
"New Rules: Polite Musings from a Timid Observer"  by Bill Maher
This book is hilarious, very funny observations about famous people in the world

I bought this bottle after reading a review that claimed it kept ice for 24 hours.  My girlfriend unwrapped the box on Christmas day, and filled it that afternoon.  It had ice still 2 days later.  Sturdy, effective, and comfortable to drink from.  

I'm going to buy myself one too.

I can't not imagine having a great machete, and it's easy for me to imagine many things I would want one for. This one is cheap, not very big, and of good-enough quality and the kukri style is great for cutting brush, chopping, and would be fine of fighting too, if you had too. Truly, unless you have more money you want to spend on a machete, or really don't need one because you never leave your house out of fear and don't play Jumanji or perhaps you have no arms...this machete is for you!

With care...chop on...chop on...

This was a present on our girls 3rd birthday... She rode off an on from 2 until 9 She loved it so much we couldn't wait for the battery to run out. For the rest of the day she would only stop long enough open another gift then back to the car.  Quick to learn how to drive it... Loud?? a little bit but hey, it's a kids toy.  If they didn't make noise, the kids wouldn't like it.
Great Toy!! Great Value!

55cm is for people as tall as 5ft-5". So this works great for my wife but not for me. She is pregnant and so safety was my number one criteria for selecting this. This is an amazing anti-burst ball.

I love this Ab Wheel, but some of the reviews here are ridiculous, like when a woman claims it burned off 20 pounds in a month. That's  72,000 calories, or 2400 calories a day. To put that in perspective, you'd have to run 24 miles a day, every day, to take off 20 pounds in a month just through exercise.

Let's say you can use this devise for 3 minutes before you tire out. Heck, give it the benefit of the doubt say 5 minutes. That means it might burn off 50 calories a day. If you did that every day (unlikely, because your abs would want some rest), you could burn off just under half a pound in a month. And that's based on some pretty optimistic assumptions.

So it's not a weight loss device. But it IS a great ab strengthener, better than anything else I've use. It'll tighten up your stomach like crazy, and as long as you do some cardio to burn and keep the fat off, you'll end up with a great, flat, ripped up stomach.

Can't really go wrong here.  A metal post, some rubber grips, and a couple of wheels.  It works great, and was the cheapest I found.  

Just a tip, if you've never used it before, don't try to be a tough guy and do a rep from your feet.  You may be tough, but you might also hurt your back.  Start on your knees until you know for sure you're a tough guy

The Good:
* I couldn't find these in bricks-and-mortar stores at all, and it was a relief to purchase them affordably through a vendor I trust.
* The 1-lb weight inserts make it easy to adjust the weight, with the cuff on or off.
* I have been using them for about two weeks, and the effect on my workout - and my legs - is tremendous.

The Bad:
* The cuffs are "adjustable" with two LONG velcro straps that wrap all the way around the ankle.  No matter how carefully I wrap them, I just can't get them as tight as I'd like.  Straps which wrap  double back through D-rings would have been much more useful.
* The cuffs tend to ride down and dig into the tops of my feet. Cushioned by gel or not, I can't exactly call that "comfortable."  I'm not sure whether this is specific to this brand, or typical of ankle weight cuffs.

Overall:
I do wish I'd been able to try these and some other brands before I purchased them.  However, I'm delighted to have found them and with the results I'm seeing

I was taking Hydroxycut but it stopped working.  GNC lady told me to switch to this.  First it worked GREAT, then about half a bottle down it stopped working.  Had to take more and more.  Went back to GNC.  Told me that anything like this will work when you first start and you have to start switching it up or taking more and more, and more, and more.  Told me I should switch product every one to two months.  Just wanted to recommend that you don't stock up on just one.  It will work for a while but plan on changing once you don't feel the effects anymore

They are made so well, operate smoothly all the time and fit so many useful features into a small package.  The other review about them just doesn't hold water.  You can open the knife with a few keys attached without a problem.  The keyring has to be on one end or the other,  but it is really not a hindrance

While there are those who will deride this product as an "air matress with sides" it is really a lot of versitile fun for the dollar. It gets you on the water cheaply and efficiently. It packs down small. I've had mine for the past three years, and have taken it on all sorts of water, from calm ponds to pretty big waves in rivers with fairly strong current. I've never had a problem. It holds me and my now 6 year old daughter perfectly. It replaced my old canoe and it has the following advantages:
1) the bag fits easily in the trunk of my compact sedan
2) I don't have to worry about the boat flying off the top of my car on the freeway
3) the bag fits easily in the trunk of my compact sedan.

It is seaworthy - I have even taken it out on Lake Superior (on a very calm day) and on day paddles into the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. I love it.

The "traditional" spork never impressed me much. This thing is a spoon with a USEFUL fork on the other end and a serrated knifelike bit that might come in handy here or there. Consider - the spork's obvious habitat is eating typical backpacker food when packing, typical microwaveable foodstuffs at the office, or the stuff in your wide-mouth vacuum bottle at the field jobsite. The Light My Fire Spork fits the bill to perfection

I was hoping for more of an around the wrist type Lanyard but this is around the neck and the clasp was not to my use. I needed it for the use of carrying around USB Flash Memory, but the clasps where to large to fit into the holes made for smaller Clasps. I would say these are still nice for the gym teachers and ref's out there that need them for the whistles

This litle gadget has come in handy on a number of occasions.  It's collapsable, strong, light and easy to use.  I wish the price was under $[...], but the best price I could find was on Amazon.com and it's what my wife wanted and loves.  We also bought one each of these for our grown children and they use them constantly.  A GOOD PRODUCT!!

This is the best racquet I ever have. I'd been using Wilson for a long time (5 racquets) This one is the lightest and the most powerful. I have improved a lot. And no more pain in my elbow (tennis elbow) Thank you for such a great product

 This spring is of industrial strength. It can definitely support a heavy weight punching bag of 75 to 150 lbs. Better than any made available at your local hardware store. It's only about 4 in. long so it does not take up much space. However,if your ceiling/beams are not structurally sound, no spring coil can adequately prevent damage to them by absorbing the shock of using a heavy bag

I am writing this review primarily to let people know what to expect from this product, since Amazon/Toys R Us don't seem to have a clue - even the image was provided by a thoughtful customer. I bought this in-store at Toys R Us because sizing information was not available online (except for the size of the box, for some bizarre reason) and I didn't want to take a chance with getting the wrong size. So let me share that information with you - this helmet is suitable for head sizes from 20.5" to 22". I think overall that this is a great set, but I marked it down a point because it does not include elbow protection. From my own experience learning to skate or even snowboard, I can say that I would generally fall onto my knees or the heels of my hands, so knee pads and wrist guards would be perfect for me. But with a young child who knows?! This is for my neice (I am not a parent) and whilst I am generally happy with the set as it is, I think it would be nice to include the elbow protection (which is afterall available in other sets, but does not appear to be available separately) to make a complete safety package. Perhaps we are supposed to buy and extra set so we have the elbow pads and two sets of knee pads, or perhaps I am a touch too cynical

I recently purchased the tent cot and decided that it would be best to have the rain fly to go along with it. The rainfly fits snuggly with elastic corners. Also, there are straps that attach to the ends of the cot with clips. The sides tie down in four places to prevent it from flying around when you don't have it fully zipped up. My only gripe and the reason it doesn't get five stars is that I think it should have just come with the tent cot in the first place rather than having to order it separately

I recently purchased the GoFit 40lb weighted vest, and it's everything I hoped it would be. I was looking to add weight to my speed walking workouts, and this vest has proved to be a good choice. The weight is balanced well between front and back of my body. The shoulder straps are comfortable and have given me no problems in hourlong walks. The velcro straps are adjustable to fit all but the largest of waists to insure a snug fit and no movement. I have even used the vest when working in the yard and weight lifting, though it does hamper some bending movements. The weights can be taken out if you need to make it lighter. I am well pleased with my purchase

This scooter seems better than the basic one because it is sturdier. It also has a fender type bracket over the back wheel so she can rest her foot without inadvertantly pressing on the brake. It can be a little difficult for a child to fold and unfold. She is 10 and got it for her birthday

The scooter ride is really smooth! FAST transportation and really fun down hills. The breaking is pretty nice and I like the wheelie bar too. You guys will love it - get it! People say scooters are only for little kids, but I'm 18 and i'm loving scootering around campus to classes and etc. Everyone does it and it really holds more than 143 lbs

MSR's Pocket Rocket is a great little cooker.  Best for going light and fast. Perfect as a shared stove among two people, and even better for simple boiling or melting snow for drinking water. I would suggest this stove for use with a maximum pot capacity of two liters, more than this and it becomes a little unstable.
If your menu is simple and you live on instant meals that require only boiling water this is the stove for you. Because this is a stove designed for the minimalist, it is tiny and has a very concentrated hot spot, so if you are a backcountry gourmet and want to cook pancakes and eggs you might be better off with a stove that has a larger flame spread.  Again, great for boiling water and melting snow, but not for actual cooking

I looked at many different variations of Swiss Army Knife before I decided on this one.  I couldn't be happier!  This has an excellent variety of tools for everyday jobs (the screwdriver heads, the small blade, the scissors), and it's great for outdoor use at picnics, camping, or canoeing (the saw blade, the large knife, the toothpick).  There are still a few tools I haven't used, but overall, this is one of the best mixes of tools for the money

Any bag that doesnt have a stand will not be perfectly stable without movement.  Just the way it is.  So if you think you can by pass this point, than forget it.  But if your looking for a bag with a little more freedom to move because of space or living arrangements than you will be happy with this one but you got to remember its freestand.  

The biggest debate is water or sand?  does it really make a difference?  The best tip I can give is not matter of which one but what's under the bag that helps the most from keeping it sliding on the floor when in use.

When considering water or sand.... water is easier to empty out than sand but sand doesnt evaporate or get moldy.  
 
If you have purchased this bag and your not happy because it is freestand, than forget the freedom of movement and fill the base with cement, there's an answer for everythin

These clubs are great for a starter.  The best part is the price.  I wasn't sure if I would really like playing so I didn't want to go out and spend a fortune.  I found these clubs in the store and they were well over $100, so I went with Amazon and got free shipping.  The clubs arrived much sooner than expected and I paid a lot less!  I am very happy with my purchase

Typical Aegs shoot 280-310 and most fields that are moderated have a 350 fps limit so 400 fps aegs is great if u wanna play by yourself or in a non official place.....i also sure hope that a sniper can shoot 500 being they are normally single shot.....theyre not in the same categlory so your not comparing apples and apples.... this is a very nice gun....it is expensive for the parts included and the functionality...this gun is defidently not a beginner gun so i only reccomend it for people who have owned 2 or more aegs previously (AEG-TM ICS ,CA, AIM M4,G&P,G&G,Ect...

Another reviewer said: 
I think this product needs a few improvements, but in all it is a strong value proposition. 

Here's what I would improve if I were in charge: 

1. A higher resolution screen so that the GUI could present more information. 
2. Macintosh compatibility. 
3. The PC cable should be included. As it stands, the cable and PC software costs nearly as much as the device itself. 

I say: 
As far as the higher resolution goes, I wouldn't want the print to be any smaller, especially if you have to deal with direct sunlight otherwise you would be hard pressed to see the readout. 

Concerning issue 2 & 3 I have no comment because I did not purchase the software. 

However concerning the unit itself, I have noted the following improvements which will allow me to grade this product 5 stars. 


Noted suggestions for modification to the eCaddy. 

1. The clip should remain, however the eCaddy should be attached to the clip via a strong pull cord. This will allow quick and easy interaction to the eCaddy. (I have to suck in my gut to work the eCaddy while it is on my belt.) 

2. The order of the "Hole/Par/Handi" buttons should be switched to "Handi/Par/Hole". Again, this will allow for quick and easy interaction to the eCaddy due to the respective position of the "Player" buttons. 

3. A thin plastic slot simular to the "Player Name Slot" should be added to the back of the eCaddy so the user can insert a card with the abbreviate names of selective Golf courses. It is very difficult to remember the name of #1, #2 ~ #10. 

4 THIS IS A BIG PLUS AND SHOULD BE A MAJOR CONSIDERATION: The players default score should automatically be set to the value of par for the hole. 

This will certainly please the user of the eCaddy. Currently, I will preset the values before we tee off because I know No One will get a "Hole in One" on a Par 5 hole. It is very unlikely that they will get a "Hole in One" on a Par 4 hole and it is rare to get a "Hole in One" on a Par 3 hole. This way it is possible to not have to be as busy with the eCaddy for many holes. 

Before this product came along, I had created a spreadsheet that I uploaded to my Palm Pilot which worked well but was very difficult to read in the sunlight and tedious to use the pen to keep track of the scores while keeping up with the pace of play. 

As far as the price is concerned, I feel it's about right if you were able to purchase the unit locally. Depending on who you purchase it from, after shipping and taxes you may spend close to $60. I would feel very comfortable spending $50 tops for this product. 

Nonetheless, the eCaddy was a definite blessing.

Just the perfect cap!. It fits like no other swimming cap. It won't pull you hair when removing it, neither will slip a bit from your head after swimming several laps or flip turning. Very resistant material, and a great finish. Awesome colors!

I bought this as a Christmas gift for my brother in law, but after he opened it, we all tried it on. I have very fragile, long hair and normally swim caps rip the hair out when I'm trying to put the swim cap on or take it off. This one came on and off so easily, without any hair-pulling

I'm on my 5th cap now I think.  Silicone is great and lasts forever.  Unlike rubber (which can snag hair) and latex (which some people are allergic to) silicone fits smoothly over wet hair, has a glossy finish so it looks great and doesn't lose elasticity. I have a some advice if you want to try this product that I've learned overt the years:
1. Always rinse and hang dry.  I've left wet caps in my gym bag and after a month of two of neglect, it develops black spots. I don't know if it's mold, it doesn't wash off...and you'll have to buy a new cap if you don't like the spotted look.
2. Pull it on gently.  I've ripped one when I was trying to stretch it over my head because my long nails cut right through it. It's not cloth so you have to be careful. This goes for latex and rubber, too.
3. Wet your hair first.  If your hair is dry when you put it on, you will trap air under the cap.  And since it's not a permeable material, the cap will start to come off while you swim because of the air trying to escape inside.  
4. Pick a fun color.  
That's it.  Have a great swim

This is something that I have wanted for a very long time.  When I first starting seeing the Bowflex on those terrible TV Infomercials, I thought, "Wow, what a piece of garbage."  Later on, while serving in the US Air Force over seas, my squadron had managed to tactically acquire one.  Along with the rest of our daily regiment of physical training, a few of us would spend half an hour or so each on this odd looking apparatus.  It quickly became obvious that this was, in fact, not a piece of garbage.  Just as the few of us using it were showing some impressive results and starting to convince the rest of the squadron of its worth, we were deployed to various points of interest throughout the Middle East.  When we returned, the Bowflex was gone and we were all very upset about it.

It has been a few years now, and I have since left the service.  I sent my body into a sort of accelerated atrophy alongside a bit too much of partying, to include too much drinking and too much eating.  I recently re-started some of my training, but I could only describe my progress as slow.  Then I came back to the Bowflex, found a good price for it on Amazon, and went for it.

It takes a while to set up, so unless you are patient and fairly adept to the use of Lego's, I would suggest that you not expect to use it the day you get it.  If you do, as I did, I would suggest that you start out slow, as I did not.  I went with one of my old routines, which pretty much kicked my back side for about three days (and after only one workout).  The machine comes with a variety of assembly, workout, diet, and overall health aids.  Keep in mind that the weight loss guarantee only counts if you follow their workouts and diet plans closely.

Now for the only part that matters.  Here it is:  It works.  Now here's the disclaimer:  It only works if you work.  Just like any other machine, weight set, pair of running shoes, etc. this machine is nothing unless you routinely use it for a workout.  If you already have a few machines sitting around you house that have, say, clothes drying on them, then this is not for you.  Don't spend the money on this if you can't stick to a routine.  Just buy a nice TV and sound system.  If you can stick to a routine, this is perfect.  If you want it to work a bit better, add a little cross training, such as running or swimming

The Bowflex is a replacement for one of the older models(original, by Schwinn)that my husband has used consistently for 12 years. It came in one huge box, and took the two of us half a day to put together. The directions and diagrams were pretty clear. One piece was broken, but they sent out a new one within the week and it is now complete. They have changed the power-rod holder, so we can't salvage most of the old ones. My husband did figure out a way to position two 50-lb rods into the new slots so he could use more resistance. It is not as compact as the older model, but it does fold up somewhat. Overall, he is very pleased with this purchase-- we paid less for this one through Amazon than we did in 1995

I got this a few years back, and it is a very important member of our household still! My wrist was smashed in an auto accident many years ago and i no longer have the ability to hold free weight above my neck... the possibilities are atrocious. With the bowflex if i let go for any reason the potential catastrophe is avoided.

There is no stress or strain except for the muscle group you are trying to focus upon. Well made, well designed, and very well built. Like our Dyson vacuum, this is a quality product utilizing quality engineering. It may be perfect for the elderly or female/male non bodybuilder athlete because of it's non need for a spotter and the ease of changing resistance!

I am happy with my build, i don't want to be bodybuilder, if you do this may not be the correct machine for you... like it is for me at 43!

that is my opinion, and like all the others... i'm sticking to it!

thank you for your tim

Gloves are toasty...perform as expected, and are a sweet luxury after a long, cold day on the slopes; HOWEVER, the D-SIZED batteries (1 per glove) are considerably more bulky than what I expected.  Most reasonable people would anticipate having to use 3 or 4 AA batteries...but no, just one, bit fat chicken-roastin' D-sized battery.  Good product, but consider whether wearing the big ol' D's around your wrist all day will get on your nerves, or whether you'll barely notice, being bundled-up and bulkified anyway.  May also interfere with cinching up your jacket sleeves when it's really nippy out.

If you notice that when an item is that cheap on ebay that the shipping charge is always Huge to more then make up for the difference. Yes it is "cheaply made and not designed to last", but so are all similar products, so it is at least par for the course in that regard. Just trying to even out the review, I didn't think the other review was fair

I think that the sword itself is great, the casing is cool, and the mounting wood is nice. The only things I didn't like was that the keychain, Greiver, fell off once I took it out of the box.

I also wish there were instructions for installing the mounting wood to the wall and gunblade.

Otherwise, I think that I got an amazing deal

If you aren't prepared to use the Swing Setter a couple of times a week for ca. 5-10 minutes each time, you probably won't get the benefit it has to offer.  The CD and literature do a very good job of helping you to define your training regimen to which you need to add only the discipline to execute it on a regular basis.  The effects it has had on me are as follows:  a) despite my impression that my grip was solid, it forced me to assume a stronger, more compact grip that has helped me with my tendency to fade the ball; b) it has helped me to revert to being more of a hitter than a swinger (which I used to be when I was playing better) by forcing me to increase the speed of my swing (especially the backswing) and to delay release thus stopping my tendency to "cast".  The quality of construction is excellent; I can't imagine wearing it out although, I see that the magnets can lose strength over time.  My main problem has been with a looping swing - inside to outside.  So far, the Swing Setter does not seem to address this problem; I can still loop and have the magnets release at the desired time.  I would think some of the other "hinged" swing trainers would be a better help with this problem.  I do recommend the Swing Setter if for no other reason that if you have the discipline, it will serve as a conditioning device to use during the off-season.  Good luck

This is probably the most complete training aid that covers set up, swing plane, grip and tempo. However i still need video and PGA pro to correct my swing. Here is the fault that i found: i can snap the lower ball with flipping my left hand and coming steep on downswing. This is not a cure for all but it helps.
The other disadvantage is the magnetic force in the balls diminishes fast

I'm a 13 handicap and I've never bought a swing trainer before, but I saw the infomercial and thought it was worth a try. It arrived yesterday and I went through the warm-up and practice. First, the grip felt very uncomfortable. Over the years I had settled into a very comfortable and very incorrect grip. This device corrected it immediately, although I didn't know it at the time. After going through the routine described in the directions I went out to the backyard and hit wiffle balls. My grip still felt funny, but my tempo, swing path and release had improved 100% in just a few minutes. This morning I went to the driving range. The improvement was dramatic. My iron shots were longer and straighter, but that uncomfortable grip caused some stray shots with my driver. After about ten driver swings I got the hang of it... and... WOW! There's a screen out at 250 yards. On a good shot I usually hit it on one bounce. Today, I was hitting the screen 15 to 20 feet up off the ground.

Thanks David. I can't wait to get out on the course tomorrow

I am an avid golfer since the age of 18 and over the years, I have tried all the gizmos to get rid of my shots that drift to the right (or slice under pressure).  I have tried the Medicus, and still slice and other gizmos (swing jacket....junk) to no avail.  The swing setter worked for me.  It showed me a flaw in my grip (by the way, this flaw was not noted by several instructors and others I routinely play with) and also stressed cocking of the wrists to help get on plane.  I tried it and my shots immediately straightend out and now go straight or slightly left (still some over the top) but getting better every day.  I recommend combining this with the Swing Rite for a powerful swing.  You will still have to work with it a few times per week but it can be swung in the garage or back yard so you don't look like a goof on the range.  Give it a try, it is cheaper than most lessons and certainly helped me.  Good Golfing

This was another gift for my grandson's 1st birthday - he loves music, and is fascinated with the buttons on each side of the cube and enjoys pushing them - I'm not so sure he understands that he's adding instuments when he pushes each button, but as it lights up and the cube makes music, he totally enjoys the experience..

The Eureka kids 30'grasshopper is an awesome sleeping bag, and a great value. We have two girls ages 6 and 8 who we purchased the sleeping bags for. On an week long camping trip in early spring twice the temperature dipped into the thirtys, and once into the low thirtys. Our girls stayed toasty warm and comfortable in their grashopper mummy bags. These bags also pack well, and have a good zipper. For the money these bags simply can't be beat.

 	The sword itself is awesome to behold. Though the guard was only minorly spot welded and is loose from just a few minutes of play. No, I didn't hit anything. Blade is heavy, would look good if it were not scratched so bad. Can be polished up. If you know people to repair this, I suggest you do so. Cool sword, Chinese craftsmanship. Should you buy it? Hell yeah

With a job that is extremely sedentary, 3 days sitting all day at a desk, 2 days putting on 220 miles or more sitting in a car, this has been a  most welcome purchase. 
5 to 10 minutes on this each day, has greatly relieved my low back discomfort
to the point where I'm able to continue this heavy work schedule, in relative
comfort.

If compressed discs are your problem, you've got to try this, after first checking with your physician

I looked at several inversion tables before deciding on my Life Gear and have no regrets in buying it. I am 6'2" and weigh 220 lbs. and it performs beautifully for me. It is well built and the memory foam makes it comfortable to lay on. It was easy to assemble and took only a short time before I was using it. 
    I have found that just a few minutes will relax me and has helped my arthritis too.  I no longer have pain in my neck or between my shoulders. I would strongly urge people who have had back surgery to consult with their doctor before using any inversion table because they do stretch your back

This item in the green was on backorder which I didn't know when I ordered it. The seller offered to ship out a different color in this style but I really wanted the green and it was well worth the wait. 
Has scissors, tweezers, two blades (one has a file on it) and a toothpick. There's an attached ring for easy attachment to a key ring. The edelweiss flower design is clear and graphic - very pretty

With the entire market for rocker and wobble boards so overpriced for what you get, it's nice to see that you can get a quality product without paying 50%+ more.  Solidly built of high strength plastic/resin and rubber, I find this board much stronger and more comfortable than the wood ones.  I even told my chiropractor that the Thera-Band was better than what he had in his office that his supplier wanted to charge me $75 for.  It even comes with a nice brochure outlining the various exercises you can do with the board

I love this thing.  It was easy to assemble, everything just screws on and it even comes with a little needle pump!  Mine doesnt stay very well after you stop punching it or break the rythm. If you stick to the same rythm it doesnt pop off.  The suction cup holds very well but the back and forth motion causes one side to creep up slightly, and it therefore loses its suction.  I'd by it again in a second, despite this.  Would probably hold together if i put some tape around it like someone else suggested, but its not really a big problem for me.  People come to my desk and love it.  Greatest office accessory evAr

The previous reviewer provided a lot of good information about this DVD. I thought I would add a few additional comments. 

First, you get a lot of bang for your buck with these $50 Cathe DVDs - they are definately worth the money. This DVD has 3 full workouts - Boot Camp, Muscle Endurance and a Combo (of the 2). There are also a number of other options on the DVD menu.  

I workout regularly with a variety of videos/DVDs but I'm not that motivated when it comes to doing resitance training on my own. There is some light barbell work on sevaral of the Firm Cross Training videos but my barbells were mostly collecting dust. 

I found Cathe's DVDs when searching on Amazon. When I saw the description for this DVD it sounded like the perfect fit for the equipment I have but the price was really challenging. I decided to take a chance and go for it. Needless to say, I was very impressed and I even ordered another $50 Cathe DVD. 

If you have the equipment (barbells, dumb-bells, a High Step/Firm step and maybe even a medicine ball) and you enjoy an hour of resistance training, I would highly recommend this DVD. It's challenging for an experienced exerciser but it can easily be modified to to fit any other experience level. There is some intense ab work on this DVD too. If you don't have one, you might want to purchase the "Heavy Resistance TheraBand Exercise Band" for $7.49 through Amazon when you order this DVD. Cathe uses this also and the standard resistance tubing/bands aren't a good subsitute.

Although there is no price difference between Amazon and Cathe's website, when ordering through Amazon, the Cathe DVDs/Videos are shipped Priority Mail. On Cathe's website USPS is not an option so they won't ship to a PO Box. If you live outside the continental US their only shipping options are 1 or 2 day air so Amazon is a significant savings on the shipping if you live in Hawaii.

This inflatable kayak is functional and easy to transport given it's light wheight. Once inflated, it's easy to carry with just one arm when empty. It also has a very sturdy feel once it's completely inflated (I would recommend an electric pump that you can plug into your car battery charger).

With both seats in the kayak, there is suffient room and storage space for two adults and gear. I  have been using this kayak mostly for fishing with my four-year-old son on small lakes. We generally carry two fishing rods, gear box, bottled water, and other related items, along with a dry bag. Even with all this "stuff" in the boat there is plenty of room inside, and with the seats in place I have plenty of support and elbow room for paddling.

I haven't yet taken this kayak on down a creek or river so I'm not able to comment on its use in that scenario

This inflatable kayak is a hoot! I bought one yesterday and did about 12 miles on the Truckee River through Reno in it with my teenage son. (Yes, I am incredibly stiff and sore, and he's raring to go again.)

First of all realize that this does not handle like a hardbody kayak. Close, but not quite. It is just a pointy rubber raft, after all. It likes to go down the river sideways or backwards, depending upon where the heaviest bottom sits. But, it can be easily paddled by one or two persons to float just like the real thing.

About thirty years ago I used to have a fiberglass kayak and went down many rivers here in the western USA. I've worn wool long underwear under a wetsuit to stay warm and have almost lost camera gear and food in rollovers. I kinda know how to handle a kayak.

This Sevylor should not be taken through anything greater than a 4, depending upon the skill of the paddler. It rides like a typical rubber raft through crests and holes. It might be fun to play with solo in standing waves, but it would be hard to brace into because there are no foot/heel rests. There is no way to stay in it in a rollover. You'll just get dumped out.

On the practical side, it only weighs about 23 pounds, can be had for around $140, inflates easily and quickly with a plunger air pump (sold separately), is easily portaged around the rough water, has a very shallow draft, is made from some very tough PVC, is comfortable to sit in for several hours, is easy to dump water out of, cleans off quickly with just a hose, and deflates in a heartbeat to be folded back into the size of a medium suitcase. For us, it is perfect - affordable, handy in the waters we frequent, easy to inflate/deflate/store.

I'm thinking of getting another one so that he can have his own, and so that I won't get quite as splashed-on from his flailing paddling. He can also tow old mom on the wide slow parts.

Sue :)

This item is well made.  The tube is beefy and the handles are sturdy.  The included exercise booklets are lame. They have dated black and white photos showing disinterested people doing lack luster exercises.

Wow! I was really pleased with my purchase. I've never owned a heavy bag before so I didn't know what to expect. I just started martial arts so I wanted a bag to practice on, but I didn't have a lot of money to spend. This purchase was not only well within my price range, but the bag is high quality and includes a speed bag with gloves! The gloves aren't very padded, a boxer friend of mine told me the gloves included were really for use on the speed bag. The heavy bag comes filled and is very solid, the chain is heavy duty, and the connections for the chain on the bag are well attached with double stitching. I was a little uncertain about just what the Nevatear material was, now I know. My description would be a heavy duty nylon with a slight rubberized feeling. In my opinion better than the abrasive canvas bags, yet not as soft to the touch as a leather bag. Two other purchases I would recommend are a good set of padded gloves for use on the heavy bag (I purchased some padded grappling gloves) and for the speed bag you will need two things: (1) a swivel attachement (I bought the Everlast plastic ball swivel for about $15 at a local Academy Sports Store) and (2)you will need to make or purchase a backboard and stand or wall attachment (I made mine from 2 x 6's and 3/4" MDF). All in all, a GREAT purchase! I couldn't be happier

This kit also includes a speed bag!! The item description never mentions that.  Which is awesome, but I already ordered one because I thought this didn't have it.  However it is a small speed bag so keep that in mind.  The bag gloves are very "budget" just like they state. So I doubt they will last long.  The heavy bag is fully packed, so the box is about 70lbs.  Other than that this is an exceptionally good value esp. with the free shipping

I purchased these for my parents who are both in their 80's in order to bring some resistance training into their exercise programs.  My Dad takes 2 mile walks and manages the snow blower in the winter.  My mother does some treadmill walking.  They really enjoy using these bands and I think it is benefiting them.  They are simple to use and effective as if you work hard enough you can definitely feel it

This gun is really cool! It has decent aim, great fire power, and the charge lasts a long time. The only thing i find a little usettling is the fact that the clip only holds about 20 bb's at a time, but hey, you can't have everything. Anyways, great buy

This is the second Suunto Vector watch i have owned. Only because the first one was lost. The only two draw backs of this watch is battery life and my band broke twice in two years. Seems to me they could offer a much longer life battery and a band that would hold up alot better. the battery lasts about 6 months only.For the price of this watch ($230) you think tehy could do alittle better.

 Other than that i love the watc

This is a excellent product for certain needs. It is unmatched for ease of transport (I can easily carry four of them at once). The only drawback is that these tables are limited in how much weight they can hold. This makes perfect sense, of course. If they were sturdier , they would be heavier. A common sense approach to usage -- place heavier objects toward the ends and the legs rather than in the middle on the hinge -- will insure safety and longevity of the product. All in all, a very good value

Our family are backpacking campers.  We make a big deal out of loading our backpacks with everything we need while striving to keep them as light as possible.  I bought one My-Ti Titanium flatware set for my husband.  We all loved it so much that I ordered more for me and our son.  They are light weight, come with a link to keep them all connected, and we prefer them to the "sporks". When we aren't camping, they are in our lunch packs and/or picnic supplies. Amazon.com had them at the best price

My husband and his friend likes to hike and one day he and his friend met some people out of state--they wanted to share email address---no one had a pen/pencil so my husband's friend pulls out his pocket knife and inside it is a pen to write with.  Everyone was so excited to know there is a swiss army signature with a pen to write with inside.  
My husband looked everyone where in stores for this same knife set cause he wanted one just like it---could not find it so I did some searching on the net and bought it for his Christmas gift---he was so excited to receive it on Christmas morning.  Thanks

I've spent years camping with a bag of clothes half-strewn around my tent, so a new tent led me to check this out to see if I can stay organized.

The closet comes in its own thin carrying case.  It looks complicated at first opening, but it's easy to insert the fiberglass rods, zip down the corners, adjust the Velcro seams, and BOOM! you've got a very sturdy and roomy set of shelves for socks, shorts, t-shirts, towels, and medication.  There's a zip-down mesh cover to keep things out of your stuff yet keep it ventilated, and it rolls up out of the way.  Pockets on the sides for pop/beer cans, wallet, and the like are very handy, and hooks for keys on both sides let you keep things where you can find them easily.  There's even a pocket on the back that stores magazines and maps.  But the value is in keeping things organized, OFF the tent floor, where you can see that stuff without having to paw through a duffelbag and toss things all over your tent.  I'm happy to have found this neat piece of tent furniture

I live on a large college campus and have had my bikes stolen before, but with this lock I haven't had anyone even try to steal it.  It's not as heavy as I thought it would be (a plus) and it is pretty small so it can fit in just about any larger pocket.  It feels solid and looks strong too.  I would definitely buy this lock again if ever need be

These are definatly very accurate. The seem is barely visable. In pistols these dont really crack, but in my aeg rifle, which is 360FPS, these crack at close distance. But keep in mind these are light .12g's and .20g's a rerecommended for aeg's.
4 out of 5, nice polished accurate bb's

Most "replica" type weapons in this price range are just made to sit pretty on a shelf or wall, not these. Made out a single piece of stainless steel, these are very solid knives. As the previous reviewers stated, these do come very dull, but a file, a sharpener and a couple of hours can fix that. Once sharpened these knives are very useable

I would like to note I am NOT a fan of the Riddick movie, Though A blade this unique tends to get your attention reguardless! This knife is very practical, It's a solid piece of metal all around. I own a pair of these and used them on a grounded, wooden post for hours! Yet after my use they shown no sign of bends, Chips or dents! They shipped to me dull, But hey I don't mind sharpening them myself. A word of caution, You can seriously injure someone with these! Their odd form makes them very deadly if sharpened as well as mine are

This is a great little camp kitchen, just the right size without taking up a lot of room at the camp site. I have another camp kitchen bought from a well known outdoor supplier but it's massive in size and more suited for extended stays, the Guide Gear Camp Kitchen is perfect for weekend camping and shorter stays. It's compact both set up and in it's carrying bag, it'll take up hardly any space while traveling. Perfect size for a camp stove on the top table with a smaller propane or charcoal grill on the side table. The hanging pantry is strong and rugged with plenty of room to stock food, paper supplies, etc. This is a well thought out and designed kitchen and while compact has everything you'd need to enjoy the great outdoors. I highly recommend it...Buy it, try it.... You won't be dissapointed

I haven't used this camping, but I set it up in my living room as soon as I got it in the mail and it took about 2 minutes.  It looks great and I can't wait to try it out camping this summer with my family of five!!  I know exactly where I am going to put all of my camping dining essentials on this kitchen.

It's always satisfying to see that a determined manufacturer can significantly improve even the simplest of devices. It's a pleasure to hold and use this bottle.

I like:
* Not having to tip your head up to drink, since the mouthpiece is connected to a straw inside that goes to the bottom - I've never seen this design before
* Easy to flip open with one hand, yet you don't have to pull hard with your teeth like in standard designs
* Absense of taste compared to plastic bottles

I don't like:
* Diameter of the bottle is too wide to fit standard cage all the way. It takes a lot of force to push it in about 2/3 of the way and it doesn't go further. It hasn't flown out during riding yet, but I am looking for a wider cage now (not easy to find). Why not make it standard diameter for bike cages

 I'm a small person at 5'2", so this 24" Denali is perfect for me. I bought the 26" one and liked it, but it was too big, so gave that one to my husband.  The bike was easy to assemble, no problems with delivery, very quickly. I like the way the Denali shifting system so u can see what geer your in similar to my mountain bike. It Shifts smoothly rides very nice, this is my first road bike and am very pleased with it!

This is the best knife sharpening system I have ever owned. The kit has 2 medium sharpening rods, 2 fine sharpening rods, a booklet, a VCR instruction tape,& the plastic storage case which doubles as the base.
I can easily keep my Spyderco Delica knife razor sharp; also my Wusthof kitchen knives. (Even the serrated knives!) This kit takes all the guesswork out of keeping the right angle to sharpen your knives

As a hobbyist woodworker who works primarily with hand tools, I've had to learn how to put a razor edge on things like plane blades and chisels.  While I've managed to master that skill (can shave hair off my arm with these tools), putting a sharp edge on my kitchen knives has been a nightmare.  I've tried numerous methods, none of which has worked well.

About a year ago, I puchased the Spyderco sharpening kit.  Read the manual, watched the DVD, put my kitchen knives to it, and......ended up with pretty dull knives.  Frustrated, I put this kit in a kitchen drawer.

Fast-forward to last week.  The kitchen knives are dull again, and none of my sharpening systems work on the knives.  So, I pulled out the Spyderco again and gave it another try.  This time, I tried sharpening my serrated bread knife.  After just a few strokes, it was good as new.  So, I tried it on the straight knives again, but only got a modest increase in sharpness.  Now convinced that some of my kitchen knives are made from inferior stainless steel, I tried sharpening my Swiss Army Knife.  Again, after a few stokes on the Sharpmaker, I had a wicked sharp knife.

I was down in the workshop today, sharping my plane blades and chisels.  The last plane blade to sharpen was for a scrub plane...the blade on these is very convex, so sharping it is always a challenge.  Fortunately, it does not need to be super sharp, and never has been.  The Sharpmaker was sitting out, so I said "what the heck", and gave the scrub plane's blade a few freehand strokes on the Sharpmaker...no sharpening jig to hold the blade like I normally use.  For fun, I tried to shave hair off my arms....AND IT WORKED!  I couldn't believe it...this Sharpmaker makes sharpening TOO easy!

It's American-made, very well thought-out, and works amazingly well when your blades aren't made of junk steel.  What more could you ask for?

this is the best and easiest knife sharpener ever. you can sharpen anyting with it...but I use it mostly for knifes. any knife, serated, stainless, it works great on filet knives. it is quick and easy. I believe the brown stones are the key. they make getting a bad knife easy to sharpen. one you might think about taking to a grinding wheel , but in a few minutes the damn thing will be sharp enough to cut hair. best of all the knife will hold an edge after sharpened. I bought one of these 25 years ago. I still have it and it still works great. I had to buy one for the motor home. since I don't sharpen the knives in there before we go.
and once you have sharp knives you don't go back. I love this sharpener. mostly because my wife uses it too. we always have sharp knives. thanks for a great product!!  thanks Ti

the Jo is a popular fighting weapon in the orient.  It doubles as a fancy walking stick and can be displayed in a house as an artifact.  Getting hit with this would probably be like getting hit with a brick because it is approximately an inch in diameter.  this is a long weapon with some weight to it so it is best used for thrusting or using ones own motions against them.  I had a friend who perhaps put it best when he said " I never thought paying 20 bucks for a stick could be such a good deal "

This review is for Nike T-90 Club Team (32 panels)

I bought this ball for less than $15 thinking I couldn't go wrong. I hadn't used Nike balls before, so I didn't know what to expect. It turns out that this ball flies better, is softer, is rounder, and is better stitched than my more expensive adidas balls. Great practice ball, and pick-up game ball. I would have no problem using it in a small club match either. As far as my $30 adidas balls? Not a chance.

5 Stars based on performance vs. price. I hope you get as good a deal as I did (through Eastbay Athletics)

I recently recieved this gift as a birthday present.  The batteries that it came with had a little juice in them already, and since the directions said to discharge them completely before charging for the first time, I fired off a few dry rounds and a few BB's.  The blowback is quite impressive; I find myself shooting dry rounds just to see that nice blowback action.  The batteries are charged via putting them in the gun and attaching the charger to the pistol butt - so far, I've had no problems.  The gun looks and feels authentic.  I have not tried the flashlight during games just yet, though it seems very powerful (after shining it in my eyes accidentaly :p).  The main problem I had was with the magazine.  To get it out of the gun, you must pull it out; there is no magazine release button.  This wasn't too much of a problem for me, just new.  However, when I was loading the BB's into the magazine NORMALLY, the two halves of it popped open, sending the spring and BB's flying.  I put it back together and taped the sides together as reinforcement, and it works fine now.  Recommended for all not-so-hardcore players.

This is a very realistic pistol.  The blow back makes it look almost exactly like the real thing.  It's range isn't as far as rifles, but it still shoots across the yard.  When you got shot with them from 10 yards away, they still hurt a little.  One time, my dad, brother and I were battling in the front yard, and a lady in her car slowed down to see what we were doing

We just got this bag today for our son.  We got the short version of this bag, but I don't see that version on Amazon anymore.  The outside is a very nice rip-stop nylon material and soft and cuddly, and the zipper is very smooth.  The inside is a little scratchy, but I am sure it will be better after a washing.  The drawstring around the hood pulls nice and tight to keep out the air.  The only thing I was disappointed about was the color.  The picture on Amazon, and on the box it came in, is turquiose.  The bag is definitely NOT turquiose!  It is a darker blue - closer to navy - color.  And the yellow is more of a mustard color, not a bright yellow, and the inside is dark gray.  But my son likes it anyhow, and of course it doesn't affect the quality of the bag.  I like the fact that the hood turns inside out, too

This is a quite good item.  I looked at a number or similar items on amazon and this one seemed caught my eye.  It certainly does make drinking from a nalgene or similar (mine is actually from a different maker, but of the same style) much easier.  My only qualms are that it is slightly expensive for a simple piece of plastic.  Also, it is a little irritating to have to take it out and replace it everytime you want to refill the bottle.  You can fill over it I suppose, but it reduces the flow rate so that you have to fill much more carefully and slowly which reduces one of the advantages of having a large mouth bottle.  I also kind of wish that there was an easier way to access the lip of the bottle than having to unscrew and rescrew the top each time, but that is a general issue with the bottles, not this lid.  But overall, a very useful purchase

This is a great skateboard ramp for kids who are really into skateboarding. If space is an issue, this is a great product. It is very sturdy for any type of skateboarding tricks. I would recommend having an adult present at all times when folding the ramp because it is very heavy. The wheels on the side make it very portable. My boys are 13 and 11 and they LOVE it

I was overall very happy with the performance of this tent for the price aournd $100.  It recently survived well while being used for over a week of backpacking in Denali National Park in Alaska.  The  weight is slightly more than typical backpacking tents, but the price and features make up for that.  It survived over 40 mph sustained winds one night with no damage.  The two doors and size are decent for 6 foot people without being too cozy.  The vestibules are very handy for storing your boots.  On colder nights it did get a fair amount of condensation on the inside of the tent though.  Overall a good purchase.

After reviewing some of the other devices to hold the iPod Mini in place while exercising, selected the Armband Carrier. It more than adequately fills the bill of what I was looking for. Occassionally, you might have to adjust the tension on the armband to keep it from slipping down your arm, but it holds the iPod firmly in place. It can cause some chaffing if you wear a sleeveless shirt if you walk or run with the device. If you sweat a great deal while you exercise, I would advise removing the iPod from the holder after you complete your routine. Would recommend it to anyone who asks

This case was ordered to hold some medical equipment that must travel with me on my about two-weeks-per-month business travel.  The good part is that this case will probably survive falling into a black hole.  The bad part is that it takes up half my carry-on suitcase.  But that's what you pay to have protection for expensive equipment

We use these socks snowmobiling in -20F temperatures and they keep your toes from getting numb when you're are outdoors for a long stretch.  Note the amt of head from the batteries is very small, but it's enough to keep your toes from numbing out on the trails.

The don't get "hot", and they are not made to keep your feet warm inside.  The amount of heat they produce is not enought to notice in a heated home or office.

Battery life on high is about 10 hours - maybe 12 hours on low setting.

I have had my fare share of yoga mats and this one rates as one of the best. The thickness (1/8 inch) is just perfect - not too thick so it's easily portable but thick enough to provide adequate cushioning. What I really like about this mat is that it has the right amount of stickiness and grip, in a word, it is comfortable.

I bought this mat, because my gym recently began offering yoga classes, and the mats they supplied soon got pretty grody.  This mat is longer and thicker than the gym's version, looks a lot nicer, and has a good 'tacky' feel under my bare feet.  And it was cheaper than comparable mats at local stores.  It's easy to hand wash (and comes with instructions), so I can keep it clean.  Overall, it's a great yoga mat.

I was looking for a bike trainer, but did not want to spend $150 and up.  Took a chance on this one, after seeing it being sold by Nashbar and Performance.  It seems to be quite solidly constructed and holds the bike very steady and secure.  I got it set up in 5 minutes without any difficulty.  Only 3 "levels" of difficulty, but this does not seem to be much of an issue.  It is not too loud, but also not terribly quiet-- about as loud as our washing machine.  Overall, for the price (I paid $80), this trainer meets/exceeds my expectations

The first thing that I thought was "this is a lot of equipment for the money".  It comes well wrapped and is easy to assemble.  Took me about an hour.  It's relatively sturdy, although there is some minor movement of the frame when changing exercises (eg, the frame will move slightly forward when moving from leg lifts to dips).  Overall, I do not see how they make money selling it this inexpensively based on the good quality of this machine.

Keep in mind, that in order to use the chin up bar, there needs to be enough clearance from the top of the machine to the ceiling, as your chin will touch the top of the machine.  Most residential ceilings are about 8 feet

If you are trying to decide between a wood or foam yoga block, I can highly recommend the foam blocks with beveled edges because they are very comfortable. 

When you are pressing on the blocks, they are firm enough to withstand your body weight, but not overly firm so they make your hands hurt from the pressure. 

Blocks tend to encourage proper form because they allow you to slowly work into poses and provide the needed support when you can't reach the floor in a pose. The lightweight blocks are easy to move from side to side and they can work as an extension of your arm. 

There are many ways you can use these blocks and once I started to do the Yoga Step By step workouts/yoga practice sessions, I found I really did need to buy softer yoga blocks to try some of the more advanced positions.

Three things to consider in a yoga block: size, material, color.  This thing is purple = ugly.  The material is foam, and this block will still be around 1 million years after I die - for a more environmentally sound purchase try cork, for double the price, of course.  Finally, I like the size of this block, most blocks are 3x5x9, this one is 4x6x9 which means that its more stable

I bought this for myself to play with (I'm 35) and after all the presents were opened and toys, video games, and everything were forgotten (about 4 hours after Christmas), this was the ongoing favorite of the season.  Everybody, younger (down to 8) and older (to 45) had a blast with this thing after a couple minutes coaching. It's already on everybodys wish lists for upcoming birthdays and such.  This is a GREAT present for 11-18 boy. Fair warning though, there will be some good spills on the fairly short, steep learning curve - helmets, knee pads, blah, blah, are a must (and a video camera!

Got this for my 4 year old niece's birthday, she is really into Dora so she was happy with it.  The skootskate is simple to put together, but not necessary the most durable materials.  Then again, you get what you pay for. I got this on the Friday sale for ten bucks, along with some books so that there is no shipping charge.  My niece is happy, so can't complain much about that.

The Suunto bike pod is easy to install in a few minutes, and worked, as advertised, paired with the Suunto T3, Training Effects/Heart Rate monitor.  Unlike other wireless cycling computers used in the past, the Suunto bike pod does not require micro positioning on the bike and continues to send reliable signals to the Suunto T3, even in bad weather and over rough terrain. Although bike pod includes provisions for mounting the Suunto T3 on the handle bars, this configuration is not required for use.  The Suunto T3 is a wrist-worn training effects and heart rate monitor, and works fine when worn on either the left or right wrist, receiving wireless signals from the bike pod as well as the Suunto heart rate transmitter worn around the chest

I bought a flybar 800 a few months ago and its the coolest thing ever. You can jump super high on it, and the people that work for flybar are awesome. i emailed them when my ruuber tip broke, and they responded a few hours later and sent me a new one for free.

My three sons and I saw these pogos demonstrated at the Cleveland X Games a couple years ago.  We could not beleive what we saw.  This is unlike any pogo stick you have ever seen.  For the money, it's a tremendous value, and their customer service is the best I have come across.  They also make a high(er) octane version called the Flybar 1200 which supports larger riders.  For adults (yes, adults will love this thing!)or kids this is a "must have" this Christmas.  My youngest son can't wait for their next model (Flybar 400) due in '07 I believe...An absolute, 100%, thumbs-up!  Jim Woods, Akron, Ohi

I bought this bike for myself and I love it.  I got it for half the listed price.  It was originally intended as a starter to introduce myself back in to biking (at 30+yrs old) but I'm going to stick with it.  The other buyer with the bad experience must have gotten a bad bike.  The brakes are excellent and the bike itself, including shocks, are just as sturdy as my husband's expensive pro bike.  The 24inch is perfect for me, being barely five-foot-two; and doesn't seem too juvenile in stature or in color.  I highly recommend this bike

I bought a red GE Lantern a couple of years ago. I have used it for power outages, walking my dogs morning and night during the winter, and rarely, I've even used it for camping.

I haven't done any definitive studies but the battery life seems to be longer than the 16 hours GE states.  I find the light to be strong enough to read by.  During dog walks the lantern has all but been submerged in rain and it hasn't phased it.  And it's performance has not been affected by colder temperatures even down in the teens. Though I have to admit, neither the dogs, or I wanted to be out very long in weather that cold.

The workmanship is very nice.  I recently looked at Coleman lanterns and they have gone to a flimsy plastic top.  The GE lantern is built very sturdily but is light enough to carry in one hand and still control a leashed dog. 

The only downside I've found, and I don't consider this a big issue, if the lantern is knocked hard enough, say you slip and fall down a ravine in the rain, the batteries will slip out of place somewhat and the light will either dim or go out.  It is easy to fix, just transfer both dog leashes to one hand, turn the lantern upside down, unscrew the base enough so the batteries can be settled back where they belong and tighten the base back up.

I would definitely purchase another GE lantern.

The are pretty comfy and definitly help out your hands and wrists during workouts. Unfortunatly, the wear out pretty easily a the seams. I saw them cheaper at Hibbets after I ordered them from here. Oh well, only like a three dollar difference. I'll know next time when I get another pair in about two months

This is an excellent idea and greatly expands menu options while camping. You have to remember it is not a crock-pot though, the 6qt container is steel and not stoneware - I didn't. Therefore, a crock-pot dish that took 10hrs on low was done in 30min on low with this product, certainly this is not the product's fault but owner error. A very good product, highly recommended for campers and tailgaters

I'm currently in Iraq and I ordered this bike, although it took a while to get it (not uncommon in a package that is 90 percent medal) I was happy when finally I recieved it. I had a little trouble putting the brakes on and warped the alumimum screws that hold the brakes cables to the levers. After my small mishap I was on my way riding in 30 mins or less. I've had the bike for about three months or more and it has stood up to all sorts of terrain and weather. During the summer tempertures can reach 130 during the day and I had no issues with paint or the mechanics period. Now its the winter season and tempertures drop down to 30 and it rains often; still no major damage or issues other than a little rust on the four screws holding the handle bars in place. I've taken this bike threw rocks, dirt, asphalt, and plenty of sand. After a quick spray with the hose and wipe with a dry rag the bike is just as glossy and bold as the day I took it out of the box. Overall I am very pleased with this bike and plan to bring it back to the States with me when my tour is up

Living in Europe, my husband and I were dubious about ordering a bicycle for our daughter who lives in USA.  However, knowing the reputation of Amazon, we risked it.   Our final choice was the Women's Ranger by Schwinn.   It was assembled by a friend without any problems as the excellent manual was most comprehensive.   The bike is beautiful and we - and our daughter - are thrilled.   It is made of high quality components, yet is fairly light.   It is sturdy enough to handle the roughest city streets, which is where our daughter will be cycling.

The gear shift is smooth and effortless and the brakes excellent.

As a footnote, the first bike arrived with slight defects, was returned to Amazon who sent a replacement before even receiving the first bike back!   We were most impressed!   The second bike is perfect!    It looks so good too - quite important for women

 The wife and me each got a set and tried it out today. We were surprised everything was great quality and looked nice. The fins are great cut right thru the water. The snorkle is also great, kept water totaly out in waves and when diving. The mask was good/ok. You can't go wrong with this package.
  Wish I would have got the other US Divers kit with the little better mask and same fins for a few bucks more.

We are happy.

Bought this for my husband for Father's Day!  Delivered in no time! He loved it!  I let him do the registration etc. because he has more patience than I.

It works very well.  Bought the vice like attachment too so it could go in every golf cart we use including our own.  I LOVE IT. I have trouble judging distances and this is our co-toy now!

The battery went dead too soon. We called Sky Golf and they are sending a free one out posthaste. We even bought the $19.95 warranty for one year.  It's worth it!

I have used this unit twice and have been more impressed each time.

First time was a loaner from my favorite golf shop and the second was the unit that I just purchased. 

My reaction... WOW.  Great tool for golfers at all skill levels.  The information presented appears to be extremely accurate and is much more accurate than guessing or finding a marker and then interpolating distances.  I found the IntelliGreen feature extremely useful.  I was able to shoot at several greens unseen whereas before I would have laid up in a safe visible landing zone short of the green.  The target lists were consistent with the features I was concerned about on most holes.  If anything, I found the target list to contain too many items

I found registration and set up a bit tedious and would like to Sky Golf make it easier.  Be sure to read the installation instructions in the manual very closely.  Your internet browser MUST be set to allow cookies from Sky Golf.  Otherwise you may spend all day and never get set up or be able to download courses.

The variety of plans for course downloads is adequate, but I wish they would include at least a 1 year subscription to the basic "PAR" Sky Player course download plan with the purchase of the unit.

Others have complained about quality and construction.  I don't know what their standards are, but my unit seems well constructed and of very high quality material.

Bottom line, if you can afford it and you're looking for a great product to improve you knowledge of the golf courses you play... then this product is for you.

I've been doing yoga for 7 years.  I've gone through a couple of regular sticky mats by now (I don't like how they get stretchy after a couple of years), so I decided to buy something more durable.  I love the texture of this mat -- it's very solid feeling with a good bit of stick -- and it doesn't move around at all.  It has just the right amount of cushion to it, and I use it on a hard floor.  I also bought the Lumi towel (large size), also by Manduka, to put on the mat, since my hands and feet tend to sweat by the time I get to the middle of my routine, and this can make any mat slippery.  I didn't have any trouble with the coating on the mat -- it wore off after a little bit, and I used the towel until it did.  I also didn't agree with some of the other reviews saying it was too heavy.  It's a bit heavy, but not too much to carry around all over -- I made a carry handle from a yoga strap (looped over both ends of the rolled up mat) and throw it over my shoulder

Great mat. Provides good purchase, even when getting sweaty. It is a bit short, if you are above 6ft. (like me) to do Ashtanga, but is great for Hatha Yoga

A little caveat -- this review is actually for the exact same flooring system in the 1'x1' size tiles (which worked out better for me because they are a little more flexible in terms of configuration for a smaller space).  

That said, these floor mats are really great!  I wanted to create a home gym space for doing floor aerobics & step workouts as well as pilates, yoga, weighted workouts, etc.  These fit the bill absolutely perfectly!!!  They  are stiff enough that there's no danger of ankle instability because of a too-soft surface, but they are soft enough that when you do floor work, they provide excellent cushioning.  My knees used to kill me when I would do a runner's stretch, but now I actually go "ahhhh" as I'm doing them, which is great.  Not even a smidge of discomfort.  They are also really great for absorbing the jarring of high-impact activities.  Talk about an ankle, knee, and hip saver!  The ONLY discomfort I still notice and I really think it's just me) is during floorwork when I'm on my side to do leg lifts, I have some problems in the area of the greater trochanter (bony prominence at the top of the femur).  But I am very sensitive in that area due to running a marathon recently, so again, I really think it's just me.  Anyway, I just can't say enough good things about these mats -- I highly recommend them.  

Now -- to address the title of my review.....  My ONLY complaint about the mats -- and I'm echoing another recent reviewer on this -- is that when I first put them down, they slid all over the place on my hardwood floors.  Because they are not completely wall-to-wall in the configuration I had them, this was a problem.  I was able to solve the problem completely, though, by buying one of those sticky under-carpet anti-slip pads that you can get very inexpensively.  I found a yoga sticky mat placed underneath did the trick, as well.  But I would have had to put about 3 yoga sticky mats underneath to cover enough surface area to keep it from slipping.  

In short, if you have hardwood floors like me (I don't know how they would perform on carpet or other surface; you'd have to see another review to check on that), I highly recommend these mats without reservation -- provided you are willing to shell out a tiny bit of extra dough to get an anti-slip pad to put underneath.  Also, if you do, be sure to get one that covers the whole area of the mat (or very close to it).  Otherwise, if you come down on a part that's not protected during a lateral move, you may find yourself sliding across the room and losing your balance.  

A little expensive, but really worth the investment in my opinion.  Happy sweating to you (or whatever activities you plan to use the mats for).  :

These mats are easy to use, and pretty durable, but I find them to be too slippery.  Not enough friction.  A thin rubber surface would be much better

I ultimately purchased 4 of these bikes for my beach house.  They are very reasonably priced and provide a sturdy ride.  They look like a true beach cruiser and have fenders, a feature not often found on less expensive cruiser bikes. They are easy to assemble.  They were shipped quickly and arrived safe and sound.  The ride can be a bit stiff but for the price you cannot complain

These gloves are extremely high quality. They do a great job of protecting your hands, and for most exercises, they do help your grip. The have the best wrist support of any glove I've used to date. However, as mentioned: if you have small hands, the added padding/rubber in the gloves will decrease the circumference of your grip in general. This is a problem for exercises like deadlifts, chin ups, etc. Also, the material inside is a bit like felt. When your hands are sweaty, these gloves basically adhere to your hand on the inside and it usually takes me 1-2 minutes to get them off. They may just need to be broken in more, but I've used them for 3 weeks thus far.

I have 6 children.  4 couldn't ride bikes.  The scooters teach balance without worry about pedaling. The kids feel safer because they can hop off easier.  Now, 5 out of 6 of my children are riding bikes and the last probably will be soon.  Great toy

Purchased for a Christmas gift. The larger wheels and stronger construction was just what my son needed. He had the orignial A scooter for several years but is now a teen and was in need of a new razor with stronger construction. He was also wanting the wheely "kick" bar over the back wheel. Overall, the A3 gave him everything he needed to continue enjoying "the Razor." Kick stand would have been a nice addition to this model but no big sweat..can just be one more thing to break in my opinion.  Price on Amazon couldn't be beat. Price was by far the best from a host of on line sites I checked. Shipping was great deal and came quickly, within 3 or 4 days after ordering it just a week before Christmas! In the word of my son "Santa be very very good to me!

Perfect way to ensure you are drinking the minimum requirement of 8-8 oz. servings of water each day.  Fill it up in the morning and make sure it's empty by the time you go to bed at night! Very sturdy and best of all - NO plastic taste to your water!

We bought this stroller not only for jogging but also to use at places like Disneyland.  The swivel wheel makes this stroller the easiest thing to steer and our kids love it.  Our kids our three and one, both fit in the stroller comfortably.  The only draw back to the stroller is it does not have a cup holder for the parents

I like how this thing folds up nicely so after scooting around downtown (the kid, not me) I could fold it up when we enter grand central market without hitting anyone in the shins. As for age requirements, the manufacturer recommends 5 years of age. I say that's about right but get padding for every possible body part and make sure to teach her/him how to fall correctly...ie, not on unpadded body parts like your hands...And red works for boys and girls...so if you're thinking about the pink or blue one and for some reason it's double the price stick with this..

The scooter is fine. the post office lost the package, though. I called the company and they told me they would issue a refund only after so many days/weeks, and would not send a replacement unless I was willing to pay for it in advance. I opted to purchase another one through a different company that used UPS instead of USPS (more reliable shipping). Several days later the first scooter arrived, three weeks late. the cost to return it was high enough that it made more sense to just keep it. So, now I have two and only needed one. I realize USPS is at fault for the shipping, but a better action plan from the seller could have resolved this quicker. The scooter was a present for a birthday. I ordered in plenty of time to receive prior, but ended up with a very late present

Now, I have been playing tennis for 8 years and I must say, this is my favorite racket I have used. I have been using it for about two years or so and plan on using it for many more. It seems Head Liquidmetal rackets are gaining alot of popularity and I have seen more players using them within the last year or so. For me, the strings break roughly every 3 or 5 months. However, if you play at a less competitive level. They will break twice a year maybe. If you're just starting to play tennis, I don't think this would be a good racket to begin with, however if you play for a while and find yourself enjoying the sport and wish to play long term, this is the racket you need. Enjoy

I was actually surprised at how much this bike exceeded my expectations.  It's more than quiet, it's SILENT.  Very good resistance settings and even a nice variety of programs.  The bike is sturdy and easy to put together.  It's compact and doesn't take up a lot of room and the seat is also quite comfortable.  I couldn't be more happy with this purchase.  For those concerned about the shipping issues that were raised, my box had a dent or two, but the contents were fine and there were no missing parts

This is the best wind up light you're going to find. I advise everyone to get one for that unexpected event. Our power goes out about twice a winter from ice storms and this is one of my favorite lights and can be depended on along with the light from the freeplay plus. I got mine at the local Target store and I think it was only $35.00 and well worth it

some of the pros of buying the sniper rifle is...
it shoots crazy fast and is very accurate
I shot my uncle with it and it made him BLEED
none of the kids in my neighborhood want to fite against me any more
some of the cons of buying the sniper rifle is...
the safety can't be pushed to hard or it comes out
the handle starts getting kind of wobly and mine came off
the battery takes longer than it says to charge to work

please take my advice because I have had this gun for more than a year now and I know it front and back

First off, those of you calling it a "clip" should know that a clip is a nonremovable ammunition storage device attatched to or built into the gun itself. Please call it a magazine (actual name for it) And a full metal jacket isnt a full magazine of amunition its a bullet with a full metal casing like say 30-06 round. Second, dont complain about the scope because it is a decorative instrument. you can buy better scopes if your hardcore but if you are hardcore then get a real gun. this gun is good for shooting your little cousin from far away. Its a great gun dont get me wrong but its not meant to be used and abused like a ww2 garand or bar. It's plastic, it shoots things. I'm probably reinstating most of what everyone else said but thats just one more reassurance. So yeah get this gun if airsoft is a hobby for you. NOT A SPORT. I also suggest getting .20g bbs and maybe a speedloader or 2 cause mags are so expensive and this gun pours ammo like water. Have fun.

P.S. Though they may noth have the trigger finger ability, spring airsoft guns have a tendency to be more accurate and fire harder with heavier bb's. If you are playin with friends i suggest getting a $30 dollar rifle with 250-300 fps (shoots like 300-350

I am a plus size person, 6' tall with 69" hips and within the 400# weight limit.  This chair fits me perfectly and feels so sturdy!  I did a lot of research trying to find a chair that would accomodate me and my friends and this is the one!  I will be buying more!  The manufacturer of the chair states that ".... a 300 pound person can use this chair and it will withstand vigorous use. We work in conjunction with STR Labs to develop and administer destructive testing of our products. Our "reality check" is for a TRAVELCHAIR product to withstand twice the force exerted by the recommended weight limit in an "agressive" situation.

This has to be one the best Protein supplements in the market! And more importantly, the taste is just unbelievable! The Banana Creme and Vanilla flavors are the best. From a "Supplement Facts" perspective, each RTD bottle is packed with 32, yeah 32g of Protein, and only 14g of Carbohydrates! The Total fat is 16g which might be on the higher side, again 6g of which are in the form of MCT (Medium Chain Triglycerides) that are typically burned as energy and aren't stored as body fat! All in all, it works really good for me and if you are an active person like I am, you should prolly go get yourself some. (GNC also sells this for like 3 bucks

Being a bodybuilder, I hoist heavy weights all the time; a major stress especially when it comes to squats.  I ordered the boots when I realized I had shrunk to 5'10.5" from being 6'0.5".  I was thusly very happy when after approximately 5 weeks of hanging (5 times a week, 10-15 min intervals) that I am nearly back to my original height (6' 0.25").  I highly suggest this product as a supplement to good [emphasis on good] chiropractic care.  
To those who have/will order this product, don't be discouraged if it seems to hurt your back at first; that's totally normal because your back is trying to readjust while the discs [which cushion the vertebrate] start rehydrating.  Also, it will take some time to find the strap tightness that's right for your legs.  Generally, tighter on the top strap and looser on the bottom is a good combination.
p.s.  Hang from a real pull-up bar and make sure you have someone to spot you if you are not strong enough to pull yourself back up the bar to unlatch yourself.

This has been a great addition to my truck - a useful compass and outside thermometer without going to the expense of a navigation system (and without having to learn another techno-gadget).  My only complaint is that the display illumination could be a bit brighter.  I realize that a bright light on the dashboard could impair one's night vision, but a bit more contrast on the display would be helpful at night.

My unit was really easy to install ... no wires just suction cups for the main unit and no tools required for the temperature unit.  I drive mostly during the day so I like the unit, but those who do night driving cannot see the DIM LIGHT.
I had to remove unit in order to pass the VA state inspection.
In cold weather, the temp guage sometimes does not work.
Also, about the temp sensor ... If you place it too near the hot parts of the radiator it will not be accurate while driving in town or when stopped.  Behind the front license tag is great ... I put an old license tag under the new one and drilled holes to hold the temp sensor. That method works great.
I really like the automatic calibration feature

We had been looking for a light-weight backpacking tent with enough room for two. That seems simple enough, unless you've actually been inside of some of the "two-person" tents. Some of the expedition tents meet the size requirements, but are too heavy to be considered backpacking tents. We have just used this tent for the first time, and we are so far pleased. Plenty of room inside for two adults with large sleeping mats and sleeping bags, and a bit of gear. A large vesitibule on each side provides plenty of room for packs. I believe this will be a great warm-weather tent, with all of the mesh. The night we used it, it dropped below freezing. We woke to a ceiling (rainfly) covered in ice (on the inside). Didn't really expect that, with all of the ventilation, but as it was ice, it didn't drip on us. I'll chalk this experience up to extreme conditions until we use it in warmer weather. One thing that I don't like, although thus far it has not been an issue, is a seam running through the middle of the floor. It has been taped and sealed at the factory, but I just don't like the looks of it. I will seal it again before spring use, and edit this report, as we are sure to end up in a downpour here in south Texas. The tent is in fact lightweight and roomy, and so far, I am pleased. I will amend this report after having enountered weather with it

This really is a great tent.  Three people can sleep in it, but I've found it best for 2 people because then there's still room for all of your stuff (or a dog. lol).  I've used it for 3 years, and it never disappoints.  I've been in one good thunderstorm in it, and it did great and didn't leak at all.  It's very easy to set up, (especially when you arrive at your site after dark).  It vents really well, but best if you face the vented side into the wind.  Just don't forget to open out the little cross vent (with the "!") on the other side.  The inside pockets are really handy, and I think you can get a "net" that you can hang from above for more storage

This bike seat IS a HUGE pain to install on a bike. It took my husband and I working together about an hour to get it right and there were several points when we thought it wouldn't work...we persevered and got it on. It is fabulous to ride with our son. It is very sturdy. Our son is very large and rides in it just fine. The helmet slides on his head, but most helmets are tricky to get just right. Overall we have been very happy with this purchase

This item is a good value and comes packaged in a convienent container.  The beads can be reactivated by simply following the manufacturer's instructions and baking in an oven.  the 40 gram package is nice sized for small spaces/drawers, however larger spaces may require more than one.  Overall, this item is a nice value for those that do not want to buy the silica gel in a bulk package and deal with making your own container(s).  I would recommend for anyone keeping tools or other collectables where moisture is not wanted

I just bought the SpeedBelt 2, deciding that the 4 bottle belt would be more cumbersome for me. So far, the 2 bottle belt has worked well for me in the 5-10 mile run range. It fits 2 gels comfortably and 10 ozs of water in each bottle. For longer runs, I'd suggest the 4-bottle belt, but this one is great for the intermediate range. The belt fits comfortably and I didn't feel that it bounced around much at all. Recommended

I have been completely satisfied with Jansport backpacks.  They are very well made and I love the guarantee.  The straps are more comfortable than other backpacks purchased.  My 14 year old son has had one for three years, and it is still in great condition.  Previous cheaper backpacks have lasted a year or two at the most.  This model has lots of zipper pockets in different sizes for storing just about anything you'd want to put in a backpack.  Great product

I've had this backpack for about 5 months now, and I still have a great opinion of it. It holds many books and folders... It can also accomodate my Inspiron laptop with a 15.4'' screen. The backpack doesn't have an included laptop sleeve, so I found a solution by buying the Sumdex Padded Large Laptop sleeve, which isn't very expensive, but very protective and a perfect fit, and just putting the Laptop in the sleeve then putting the sleeve into my backpack. Even after doing so, I still had room for a couple of books. Keep in mind that this does make it a large backpack, slightly bulky, so if you aren't in need of something with such a high capacity, then this might not be the backpack for you.

The backpack doesn't have a lot of organization as far as dedicated slots for pencils, pens, etc... It just has a few smaller zippered openings. If you have a lot of stuff in them, you will be having to fumble around your things. I didn't find this too troublesome overall, though.

The backpack is comfortable, and seems to be holding up pretty well against all the weight of my nursing books, etc...

I am happy with my purchase, as I always have been with Jansport purchases

Hey,

I decided to review some things I didn't buy off Amazon, but I have owned for sometime that are really great items: the kind I would buy again for sure if they were lost. I would say lost or broken, but Jansport has lifetime warranties! If anything happens to your backpack, all you have to do is mail it to Jansport with a note of the problem, they will fix it for FREE and send it back to you. They will even send you a card while they have it telling you it misses you and will be back soon. Overall, these are such great products, you just have to get a Jansport if you're thinking of a backpack.

Also, I am in a review writing competition with a friend of mine and if this review is helpful, which I hope it really is, I would love to have your yes vote!

With Care, 
Sa

We pruchased this tent for our annual car camping trip in Northern MI, where weather is very unpredictable.  We've had other tents that took FOREVER to set up, but this one was super simple.  I think it too two of us less than 15 minutes to have it up and ready.  We loved the size of this tent - plenty of room for our air mattress and gear.  The air circulation was great, too.  Even in the heat of the day, we had a nice breeze keeping us cool, thanks to a miriad of windows.  When rain came during the night, we stayed dry, though I would recommend sealing the seams prior to using this tent.  Overall, we're really happy with this tent (especially for the price!), and plan to use it for several years

I just got this from Khol's. They had it on sale for $11.99. When I saw it, there were plenty on the shelves. I was kind of curious as to what they were because of its funny shape.  There was a try me sign on there. So in my boredom, while waiting for my ride, I read the directions on the back and actually tried it. It was kind of funny to read 'wind up for light'.

I'm glad I checked out the aisle. I've never seen anything so cool.

It's very simple to wind-up the flashlight. The ball has a special roller that allows you to pump easily. It's not difficult to follow the instructions. Anyone could do it. 

The lightbulb is LED so according to my internet research LED:
"LEDs have an extremely long life span, twice longer than the best fluorescent bulbs and twenty times longer than the best incandescent bulbs.
"

The design is actually very nice to the touch. It's padded with some nice rubber grip, so its not unpleasant to hold. It's not very heavy at all. It's about the size of a male's electric shaver.

I bought it at Khol's for more money than its listed here on Amazon. I got it today and I showed my younger siblings. They loved it, too.

Basically the light is powered by the mechanical motion of your hand. It's really simple to use and its a comfortable design. I plan on going back to get more tomorrow.)

2nd Suunto. 1st was a Vector bought in 2000 that I abused pretty good before having to get another (water seal was damaged and it took on water during a kayaking trip). Doubt I'll ever use the heart monitor in the mountains but it is excellent for training. Highly recommended

I after drooling over this watch for two years wishing I had one, I finally got one and have had my Advizor for two months now.  All I can say is that if I had known how cool this thing really was, I would have shelled out the $300 a long time ago. Each one of the features listed above does everything you could want. The Heart Rate Monitor has target zone settings, average workout heart rate, highest and lowest hear rate, and more. The Altimeter tells your rate of ascent, total vertical climb and stores all the data from recent workouts in memory. The coolest feature is that it will store your heart rate, altitude and rate of ascent/decent at intervals from 20 seconds to ten minutes so that after a workout you can scroll though and see how your heart rate was affected by altitude and acent rate. I got completely geeky with this information after one workout, and I typed it all into my computer so I could see what it looked like. The only drawback to the Advizor is that it gives you so much information, it would be great if you could download it directly to a computer for analysis. There is no PC link, so any analysis has to be done on the watch or typed in by hand. But other than that, this gizmo is perfect. No problems at all so far and I use the thing for two workouts a day.  I am a cross country ski racer and for a long time I had thought that this would be the perfect training aid for endurance athletes and now that I have tried it I know that it is

This review will focus on the specs since there is minimal information available unless you buy the bike.

First off, this is my second Mongoose.  I started out on a crappy low end Cruiser model, so anything even half a step up from that model is a vast improvement.  

The Theory weighs about 38 lbs and is actually light grey in color despite the image on this website.  I thought I was getting a white bike, and I'm a little ticked it's actually grey, but, whateva.

Assembly isn't too bad as long as you have half a clue as to what you're doing.  The documentation is adequate, but don't expect to be able to assemble this bike correctly if you haven't done it before.  The documentation will frustrate you.  But the average person can probably install the pedals and the saddle, and maybe even mount the handlbars correctly assuming the brakes don't arrive screwed up like mine did.  The front cable had to be relocated because when it was assembled at the plant, it was threaded immediately under the fork and the tire was rubbing against it so it had to be removed and resituated, which entailed messing with the front cable.  Simple enough, I suppose, but this assumes you know what you're doing.  

I couldn't install the front tire correctly because of the disc brake, and, wanting to be safe instead of stupid, I took the bike to an LBS and had them install it. It was then that I found out one of the disc pads was missing.  No problem.  I just went back home and found it in the box. Apparently it had become dislodged from the housing on the front tire during transit.  I didn't even know it was there because I haven't worked with disc pads before. It was a good thing I didn't toss the box right away otherwise I would have been SOL.  Just be advised, however, that if you are missing one or both disc pads and do toss out the box before you realize one of the pads is missing, depending on where you are, you may or may not be able to find replacement pads.  You may end up having to upgrade to a better brand disc brake.

Now onto the specs.  The front disc brake is Promax brand, DSK-400, which in the world of mtn biking, is the generic low end.  I had to do some digging around on the web to find the following site because you won't find a "[...]" website.  It wasn't really all that much more helpful and did not help me to understand disc brakes any better, but at least you'll have a better idea what to look for.  The documentation on the site have color images vs the black and white images that come enclosed with the bike.   Go here instead:  [...]

I wouldn't call the Promax disc brake crap, but, close enough.  Note: If you plan on doing any kind of semi-serious mtn biking, as in on a trail considered "intermediate" level, then upgrade the disc brakes.  And if you're planning a real mtn biking trip with rocks and logs and the whole nine, then the Theory can probably handle it, just don't expect miracles.

As to the gears, there are 21 Shimano flavored and they work flawlessly.  They're a pleasure to have because there isn't the usual slipping and dragging you see on lower end Mongoose mtn bikes.  The only problem I had was the upper gears don't seem to want to shift into any gear definitely unless you downshift say, to 2, then upshift to 3, for example, and so forth for the others.  If you want 6, then go to 5, then upshift and vice versa.  This may or may not be because the cogs need to be lubed.

As to the ride, the Theory is a dual-suspension bike and you can really feel the difference vs a hard-tail bike.  Wow.  Just riding on the street and going over speed bumps and rain gulleys is amazing.  You have very little to no shock at all because the suspension absorbs it.   

Overall, this bike is good bang for the buck, but I wouldn't pay over $300.00 tops for it.  If you're going to go that high, you can get something else with higher end parts.  Oh, one last thing.  If you value your reproductive organs, and don't want to find yourself numb from package to exit and/or sitting on a bag of frozen peas for a week after using the bike, then do yourself a favor and switch out the saddle.  The one that comes with the Theory is horrible.  Get a thicker padded, gel lined, split saddle instead.

When the product came I realized that it wasn't what I was looking for in a fanny pack but I was impressed with its rugged construction.  I needed a pack to walk around Disney World and thought the two water bottle holders would come in handy.  I like to freeze my store bought water bottles so that they stay cold all day.  The water bottles that come with this pack are double wide and have a wide top - meaning you can't wrap your lips around it like a store bought bottle. Plus you have to wash and refill them as opposed to just buying another Dasani.  Unfortunately, you can't use the water bottle holder for anything much narrower than the included bottles because there is just a single strap across the bottom preventing their bottle from falling through but that wouldn't stop a regular 16 oz. job from slipping passed.  So I'm returning mine, but if your looking for non breakable, wide mouthed water bottles, in a rugged waistpack then this is for you.   PS for some reason the blue one is cheaper, at least when I bought it

The Bowflex Series 7 Treadmill is as good as advertised.  It was easy to assemble and the instructions were thorough.  It is also very easy to program and operate.  No time is wasted figuring out the instruction manual.  I also love the quietness of the motor.  
Because the machine is sturdy you will need some help moving it into place.  Go ahead and get it...

No, this gun isn't very powerful - but THAT'S THE POINT. This gun is perfect for a young kid to learn about guns.  Slow enough you can actually see the BB, accurate enough to hit a target routinely at around 20 to 25 feet

Well, I originally ordered the Black UTG Black Sniper Rifle, but was out of stock at Air-Splat. Well, I could have waited 3-4 weeks or get the Green UTG OD Green Sniper Rifle that I had been thinking about ahead of time. So I sent a reply e-mail and they sent this rifle about 3 days later. The screws, you get some screws, now on the newer versions, the long screw that is supposed to go in the port behind the trigger, is not the long screw. You put in a short screw, well at least for me. I had tried to figure out what was wrong, finally decided to call them and they told me what to do.
Now to the Gun- Excelent. Definently get a scope if you plan on being a sniper. Also, have your friends wear good goggles and no bear skin. It will either bleed or nice a welt, and if thats cool with you, than by all means dont tell them untill its to late. The gun itself should only be used with .20g and up. Anything less will ruin the gun. With .20g you can easily punch through a unopened can of soda. The gun in a airsoft battle is a bit mixed. Personally, I stay back and take head shots at the other team's leaders and medics. With the bolt-action that you use, you can decide when you are going to relode. Also, you should also get alot of white .20g. With white .20g, you can adjust where you fire and get even more accurate shots. 
Pros:
Very accurate
Very painful (could be con, depends on how you look at it)
Weighted well
Very intimidating looking 

Cons:
A bit heavy for long games (But you should be moving anyways now should you?)
If you dont sight your scope (or dont even get one) there are no aiming sights, it would be a bit wasy to miss

I just ordered this beauty.  The price is right, the price will probably be more expensive in a few months.  The full tang is very sturdy.  The handle is usually a lil thin (flat) on these type of blades.  

I was also looking at the Galaxy Viper twin blades in silver (also comes in black) but there's no pic of the shealth.  It just says it's nylon shealth.  It holds the 2 blades.  This wasn't exactly what I was looking for so I chose the Ronin.  

BTW, I got the last 1 from a seller.  They were out of stock last time I checked.

It was just what I wanted--a relatively stress-free low-impact workout that you can do while zoning out in front of the tv. Takes about 30 minutes to put together. It's quiet, stowable, and fun. My ten-year-old likes it, too. I don't have any problems keeping my feet in the straps as long as I'm wearing shoes, so maybe the people who were complaining about that issue hadn't been wearing shoes. A really nice little machine, and what a great price

after a several uses, the anti-fog starts to fail... 

at the beginning when it is band new, it works great! Clear and sharp.

I always wash it with water and hand soap after swimming to clean up the clorine ...  still, the anti fog inner layer wears out quickly.

The good thing is that it doesn't leak... that's the important part.

Over all, it's still a great product compare to other models.  If not because of the poor anti-fog thing, I would have give it a 5 stars rating

I bought these [clear color version] as a gift for a young adult male who is an avid indoor swimmer.  According to the gift recipient, "they're excellent," they really don't leak or fog up.  He was thrilled to finally find a pair of goggles that didn't get any water in his eyes. (but please note: he doesn't swim for more than one half-hour at a time, so I can't vouch for whether they stay unfogged after longer periods of continuous pool activity.) He also said that the fit is very good, and the choices of nose bridge make these goggles accessible to most face types.  For the price, these are an excellent bargain

Waterproof cases are so expensive!  (and heavy) We aren't divers, but spend lots of time outdoors in conditions hostile to electronics, skiing, hiking, fishing, at the beach, etc.  In addition to water, dirty hands, sand, and dust are hazards.

This Aquapac performs as described, kept the camera (Canon A95) safe and dry despite immersion in swimming pool etc.  The picture quality was unaffected, but flash doesn't work well due to internal reflections.

Well worth the price

I recently returned from almost 3 weeks of treking around Italy. I'm not a runner (or a walker, or even mildly aerobic) and I have baby-tender feet, so I was very concerned about blistering. On the advice of some runner-friends, I bought BodyGlide and coated my feet with it EVERY DAY before I put on my socks and shoes. My feet were tired and achy every night, but NO BLISTERS!! This is an amazing testament to the power of BodyGlide because sometimes I can have blisters wearing normal shoes during a normal, low activity work-day, and I was walking for hours at a time over bricks, cobblestones, you-name-it. If you are going to be traveling where you will be walking more than usual or on a differnt terrain then you are used to, buy a big, ol stick of Bodyglide and coat your feet every day

Me and a friend bought 2 of these.  They look really cool.  However they are not sharp at all (hence only 4 stars).  For $15 they are really good value though.  The hilt is plastic and the blade is a little thin.  Other than that they are quite good.

I use these for MMA type workout on bags& blocking pads, and they have worked well. They give good protection even when hitting hard. I have not had the problem with dye fading that I noticed with some other gloves. Overall I would reccomend, about the same or less than other gloves from everlast, century, ect and just as good quality.FYI There are a lot of visible seams where the pads "pockets" are attached (especially on the fingers) that you can't see well in the picture advertised. I do't think this is a big deal as many bag gloves have this, I wouldn't use them to spar as these would tend to cut. (most people would use "fighting gloves" to spar anyway, but just trying to be helpful !!

You want to loose that gut, build muscles everywhere and become a lethal adversary all at the same time? Then get a punching bag and pair of gloves. To be honest the hardest part is getting the bag to stay on the hook without pulling out your ceiling every few days. You need to consult a hardware store for the right bolt fitting. Getting this right is half the battle. When you have finally managed to find the right bolt type for your ceiling then you are on your way to becoming somebody else! 10 minutes a day will make you a mean lean machine within two months, guaranteed. Start by looking for the boxing posture on the internet. Take up this basic stance and learn to throw punches while protecting your face with the other glove. Tuck that chin in. You will cut your knuckles, even with gloves on, but these wounds will heal and soon you will find your hands hardening up with each blow. Move around the bag and make those strikes count each time. Feel the punch and try to avoid awkward possible wrist breaking miss-strikes that you don't want to make. Within a few days you will find yourself building up a quicker pace. Everyday your arms will be firmer and your muscles bigger. Your hands will become stronger. Take off the gloves at the end of the punching workout and try chopping the bag with the base of the hand, directly under the thumb with the thumb stretched out and the elbow bent. Strike downwards and sideways with the palm facing down, never up. Harden up those chop areas of the hands. Now when you have built up some nice chopping combos without gloves and boxing combos with gloves, it is time to throw in some elbow blows. Move that hand in towards your chest and strike just above the elbow with each arm. Twist that body and harden up those areas on both arms. Start striking with elbows, gloves or chops in whatever order you want. Build up a rhythm to your workout and soon you will be throwing twenty move combos at the bag. You will stun yourself. Now the next step is either to take up a proper boxing course for correction or go study some manuals on Close Quarter Combat. It beats most of the far east martial arts by using some brute force quick knockdown strategies. Try "Get Tough" by W. E. Fairbairn for starters. Rubber knives are also good. Learn the strategy in "Kill or Get Killed" by Rex Applegate. Keep up with the sport boxing and learn these powerful World War II Trench Warfare Close Quarter Combat manoeuvres for self defence. And it all starts right here with the bag. Bag owners simply have the power

I too recieved this bag in a box semi-beaten up, but then again an 80 pound item in a lightweight cardboard box is bound to cause a little box damage. And no there was no interior protective bag, and my chain pack was tied with pink ribbon. 
   Now to the bag itself... The toughest, most well filled, and economical bags I have ever seen. I use light bag gloves and with the amount of filling and it's density I can punch for hours (If I had the stamina :) ), without getting the sore knuckles or the wrist pain that I used to get from denser packed bags. Plus it's an Everlast!!! This is a must buy for anyone who is looking for a heavy bag. Good luck and TRAIN HARD!!

Here's the deal with this item: it's fine for little girls (and I suppose, little boys that are inclined to dance) who haven't been exposed to a better dance game.  I got this for Christmas for my 5 year old daughter; she takes dance, likes dancing, has never had or known about another 'Dance Dance Revolution' game, and she LOVES IT.  It's a big hit; she's jumping all over the place, adds up her score at the end of each song, and it's been a great, cheap gift, with exercise to boot.

No, it's not sophisticated.  Older kids or teens (not to mention adults) would grimace in pain over the ancient graphics and lousy sound.  For them, get one that goes in their PlayStation or whatever.  

However, many 5 year old girls don't have a PlayStation, or need one.  This is perfect for them.  For $[...] and shipping, it worked out great for a little kid.  For a teen, it's $[...] wasted.  That's the difference

I use my inversion table two or three times a day for short intervals of a few minutes each whenever my lower back starts
to hurt or tighten up. Shorter and less intensive periods of 
use achieve better results that longer and fewer periods of
use. You don't have to change clothes to use the inversion
table; you simply get on it, wearing a suit, blue jeans or pajamas. You're not going to break a sweat...you're going to
stretch your back muscles and spinal cord, which doesn't take
any physical exertion. You should wear shoes to help you hang
upside down on the inverstion table without your feet slipping
out of the stirrups I highly recommend it for people suffering
from back fatigue and back pain. I no longer need to take any expensive medication to alleviate back pain or fatigue

I bought this machine because of the low price, and I was skeptical whether it would be worthwhile. However, I was very pleasantly surprised. It is a great machine, especially for beginners who want upper body workouts. If you're a serious athlete, or if you want leg exercises, this may not be the best machine for you. For me, it is working out great, and I have purchased other machines to give me the leg exercises I want. At first, I was dismayed by the fact that there were over 100 parts to assemble, but they went together very quickly and easily, and all the tools are included. Be advised that this is only for users weighing up to 120 kilograms, or 264 pounds. Great product

The gym is very easy to assemble, took me about 45 minutes on my own.  The book supplies several different workouts, hitting every major muscle group, and you get good resistance in every workout. You won't get great range of motion on all the workouts, there may be times when you'll need to lean back or put yourself in a different position in order to get a full stretch, but those are minor adjustments you'd probably have to make on any other type of equipment.  The gym itself is light, easy to move around the house, and doesn't take up much space. It may be too light, and not sturdy enough in some instances, and you will need to stand on the frame in the stand-up workouts. 
The price is outstanding, at 180 dollars. You're not going to find a better deal than this, and the workout is very comparable to the far more expensive Bowflex

My 9 month old loves this toy.  Before he got the hang of pushing the lever down to spin the balls, he would roll it on the floor and    crawl after it. It keeps him entertained and he keeps coming back to it. Also, there are no loose parts or pieces to lose, which I appreciate.  Great toy

A friend who is a successful competition mountain bike rider asked me to weigh the Blackburn Airfix after I bought it. He has had many occasions where his chain has broken, or his tires have punctured, so he wanted to compare the weight of the Blackburn versus the weight of all the individual tools he carried when he rides. The Airfix weighed in at about 245 grams - about 8 ounces - and his tools, including inflator, tire levers, hex wrenches and chain tool (all included in the airfix) tipped the scales at 337 grams - about 11 ounces. I suppose that a multitool may not be as convenient to use as individual tools, but for handiness, this seems hard to beat. The Blackburn lifetime/no-questions-asked guarantee is also very attractive.
So while I have yet had to put this tool into action with either my Trek 2200zr or my Trek 6000, in a world where every ounce of weight is a heavy concern, pardon the pun, I imagine I have made a wise purchase

I really like this bike. It's great.  The only complaint I have is with Amazon.Com Customer Service.  The bike came partly assembled.  You really should tell customers exactly what they will have to assemble.  I put the seat and pedals on.  The "quick release" for the front tire was missing from the box.  I called customer service and they could not send me one.  She said I would have to send the bike back and get a new one.  She couldn't even give me the number of the mfg.  I was so mad.  I didn't want to send the bike back that was too much trouble.  I took it to a bike dealer and he put the front wheel on.

I really like this bike. It feels like a bike from the '50s but with all the modern technology. The look is great and draws a lot of attention. It is somewhat simple to complete the bike since it arrives mostly put together but the assembly instructions are the worst I have ever seen with any product. I basically got no clue from the instructions on how to finish off the bike, it is hard to believe how poorly they are written. I was beginning to believe they sent me the wrong directions. After I got it together through trial and error the brakes and the shifter were way out of whack and I had to spend $30 at a local bike shop to get these items adjusted; the instructions for making the adjustment did not work. The guys at the bike shop took two attempts to get it right (two trips for me) and they were wondering why it was so difficult to adjust. After all that was done I love the bike and it rides nicely and when properly adjusted, shifts and brakes very nicely. The ride is comfortable and I love the seat and location of the handlebars. I would recommend the bike for all the fun and looks it has but be prepared for some hassle to get it right unless you are one of the lucky ones who gets one that is adjusted correctly out of the box. My suggestion is for the manufacture of this bike to fire the idiot who wrote the assembly instructions and hire someone with some writing skills. I also do not understand why the brakes and shifter were so far out of adjustment; did no one test the bike before they boxed it up

The Pros are this product has alot of functionality for the price. The odometer and heart rate functions were very accurate. The set-up and operations get easier with use (first few times you will need to refer to the manual). The manual is well written and thorough. The cons are the altimeter which is far from accurate

I just received the Blackburn Delphi 6.0 earlier this week, and I've already put it through a few rides.  I'm upgrading from a Cateye Astrale 8 that I've had for a long time.  I've started training with a heart rate monitor more seriously lately, and I thought having a single integrated unit to handle both features would be great.  I almost bought the Delphi 5.0 a while ago, but decided to hold out for the 6.0 to get the nifty altimeter features.

Here are my impressions about my new computer, good and bad...

Pros:

- The mounting bracket system is very clever, and seems better that the Cateye bracket I was used to.  Changeble soft platic shims line the bracket clamp, changing the fit for different handlebar diameters.  3 different thicknesses are included, which chould accomodate everything from skinny aerobar computer mounts to oversized road handlebars.

- The altimeter function is great.  The altitude measurement is solid and seems very accurate.  The percent grade reading acts sensibly, even though it lags a little (this is explained in the manual).  The distance climbed at the end of a ride agrees very well with topographic software, and works far better than the GPS-based solution I had been using.

- The Lap feature is great for capturing statistical snapshots of particular segments of your ride.  Had a big hill on your route, and want to know how much you climbed and how fast you averaged up the grade?  The Delphi makes it really easy to see those sections taken out of the whole.  Up to 20 laps can be recorded.  I think of them less as "laps" and more as "intervals".

- The backlight feature is very cool.  I've always just done without computer info at night before...but this way, I don't have to.  I'm sure it kills batteries, but it's nice to have.

Cons:

- The average speed algorithm seems a little flaky.  It seems to read ay least 0.1 mph slower than one would get by simply dividing distance by ride time.  My Cateye always agreed well with the calculated value, but the way the Delphi is figuring the average must be different.  This is liveable, and seems to be less of a problem on routes without a lot of stopping.

- The max heart rate reading can get ruined by frequent "spikes", so that the real Max HR is unknown.  Finishing a ride, it's possible that the max HR will show something unrealistic like 235, probably due to a signal glitch or some interference.  Then, you have no way of knowing what the true value is.  These spikes don't affect the average, however.  I should mention that I've seen this behavior on both of the standalone HRMs I've had before...so it's not unique to the Delphi.

- The cadendce sensor was hard to mount so that the magnet was close enough to the sensor.  I had to put the magnet very close to the end of the crank, because the crank arm is close enough to the chainstay at that point.  But mounted there, the magnet covers the back side of the pedal spindle.  If you have pedals which require a hexkey from the back side to remove, that could be a problem.  They could have remedied that by making the cadence magnet a little thicker.  For comparison, my Cateye crank magnet was mounted in the middle of the arm with no problem.

- The wire from the cadence-enabled bracket to the cadence sensor is very long.  This may be good for putting it out on aerobars or something, and I admit that too long is better than too short.  But I have a foot or more of extra cable to try to hide around my shifter cable housings, and it's hard to tuck that slack away.  And I have a large bike frame with plenty of tube real estate to spare.

- Unlike my standalone HRMs, the Delphi doesn't calculate calories used.  Not that those numbers are ever accurate anyway, but it would be nice for ride-to-ride comparison.

General Thoughts

Overall, I think it's a great computer.  The negatives above all are really minor issues, and I haven't found a computer yet that offers as much for such a reasonable price.  There's a lot more to tell than I can include in a review like this.  I'm just trying to hit the big highlights (and lowlights).  But definitely, no regrets on this end for buying it.

Love the trike--it is so cute.  My 2 yr old got it for his birthday and loves it.  The instructions to put it together were not very good, but it's a trike, so it wasn't that hard to figure out.  I would recommend this trike to any "Cars" fan!

I have 20 mo. old twin boys. I was given 2 different tricycles and each of my boys only wanted to ride the Disney McQueen trike so I had to purchace another one. This trike has two different sitting positions, has a wide wheel base for stability, and sits lower to the ground. My boys still can't use the pedels but love to use the trike as a ride on toy - It's a great trike for younger toddlers who want to ride early!

I just ordered a pair of these for my son, since my daughter is so pleased with them.  The wheel base is wide enough that beginners can get their balance quickly.  The wheels roll very smoothly.  The velcro attachment at the top provides ankle support, and is easier to adjust than just laces.  A fun outdoor activity!

I received my fitness bands shortly after placing my order.  At first, I was confused, because I was expecting a box and instead it was a mailer envelope, but I couldn't be more pleased with the product.  For just a couple of bucks, I am able to find different ways to challenge the muscle groups in my upper body.  Also, I can take it absolutely anywhere; one could fit in my pocket.


Here is the breakdown of the different colors and resistance which I've taken from the merchant's website.


Color	        Resistance
Red X-Light	3.3 lbs.
Orange Light	4.5 lbs.
Yellow Lt./Med.	6 lbs.
Green Medium	8 lbs.
Blue Med./Hvy.	10 lbs.
Indigo Heavy	15 lbs.
Violet X-Hvy.	20 lbs.


If you can sympathize with any of the following scenarios, this product is something I would recommend for you (Well, I'd recommend it for anyone, but these are the clients who have been searching for an answer):

1. You live in a tiny apartment and/or don't have a lot of a lot of storage space.  You need something that you can tuck behind your DVDs when it's not being used.

2. You don't have the means to pay for weights or weight-training equipment.

3. You can't afford to go to the gym, or are intimidated about going because everyone there is always so friggin' buff.


Do not purchase if you are allergic to latex.  It is only 90% free of soluable allergens, so if you are allergic, don't buy it.  This information is specifically listed in the product description so ignore the poor review by the illiterate complainer.


Other than that, enjoy the product and happy toning

I got this as a gift and just love it.  You wouldn't believe how difficult it is to balance on it without using your legs.  It's fun and you can just use it while you're watching TV.  How could that be wrong

This count up/down timer is exactly what I was looking for. No bells, no whistles -- just timings up and down. It's small and light, and can be clipped or held. It even has a magnet for attaching to metal surfaces. I only wish it had a shut-off switch so that it doesn't start counting (and beeping) if it's accidentally brushed

This is the same system released 4+ years ago.(This is the Fanny Lifter-not the Box and not the Transfirmer-the wider steps.)  

I was very out of shape-couldn't make it up stairs without being out of breath.  It was very tough starting up...I couldn't make it through a whole workout until almost the 10th workout.  I went from a size 16 to a size 6.  Because of this system I have fallen in love with exercise and feeling/looking great!

Allie, Lisa and Jen are great leads

I just love this workout, it really gets you sweating. It's a great workout for beginners as well, not too fast or complicated. I just started working out with The Firm System, and plan to use it to get back into shape. You can always purchase more DVD's to keep you motivated. I recommend this product to anyone who want to get into or stay in shape.

I like this for both the biking and running/walking. Easy to set up the pedometer, a little harder for the bike. There's a long cord. The front also scratched when I removed the plastic covering making it harder to read on the right side. It's working great though and I'm happy with the product

I have this for a month now. It has two pices joined by rubber which reduces the shock. In addition you might want to attach that rubber shock absorber which you can get under $5 in a sports store.

As a chef in a hot DC kitchen, I have tried all manner of powder and cream with the hope of eliminating or decreasing chafing.  At one point, I even devised a kind of "rosin bag" of cornstarch suspended on a string...

THIS STUFF WORKS FOR ME.  And if it works for me, in the hours of blistering heat and hot sweat... it will work for you

This product is phenomenal.  It reduces if not eliminates chaffing when applied properly.  It worked under my wetsuit.  It works under your arms and around your neck during open water swimming.  It works between your thighs or on your chest when running.  It may even prevent blistering on your toes while running, but I can't directly confirm that.  I'd recommend reapplying every four hours

Body Max is a very tough DVD.  I didn't find the step choreography too difficult to learn, but some of the combos were a bit quick and advanced.  I do recommend watching the cardio before attempting, or you'll be rewinding quite a bit like I did.  Cathe's cuing is great, especially while teaching the combo.

The complete workout is long and tough, but completely worth it.  If you don't have enough time, there are several premixes that have shorter lengths.  The premixes may be shorter, but they're no less intense

This DVD is tough... but don't be scared. Cathe does a great job with the premixes and you can pick shorter versions of the workout. I love the music on this DVD.... It's so much fun... it makes me want to keep jumping!!! The upper body routine is about 20 minutes long. It's efficient and straight to the point.

I've never seen results as quickly before... Cathe will definitely delivery results!!!

I've owned a Gust Buster for over 5 years now and it works great.  I've had it out in the early winds of a hurricane and it worked exactly as it was intended.  I like the big size because it keeps the rain away from more of me than the smaller ones do.  Mine isn't automatic, so maybe that's a problem, but every automatic umbrella I've ever owned eventually stopped working and had to be opened by hand

This is a great cot.  It is low profile, and made of strong materials.  I was worried about the wire legs, but they are very, very strong.  So strong that it takes some muscle to get them into their holes in the frame.  This might be a drawback for someone who is weak in the arms.  It folds up easy and is very portable.  Also, I have a smaller frame, and although this cot is perfect for me, a larger frame person might want to consider a wider version for comfort in the shoulder area.  You won't be disappointed in this one for the money

  I had seen this table at an outdoor concert and have been looking for some time to find it.  Just recently I saw one being used at a resort while we were on vacation.
 It is easy to set up and very stable.  We will use it for  picnics as well as an additional table on our deck.  The carry bag is another plus.  
No more bending over to serve food from the top of the cooler.

This is a great light, perfect for a "be seen" and backup light in addition to a stronger source.  The plastic handlebar mount failed on mine the first time out, apparently cracking from vibration fatigue.  The customer support from Princeton was terrific, though, and they sent a replacement mount (I contacted them on Friday and had the part Monday).  I may try to rig a velcro strap through the clip and attach that directly around the bar instead of using the supplied part

And the attached rainfly came in handy once as well.  It comes with a bunch of extra attached straps to secure all the extras (tent rods, sleeping pad, rope, etc...)

I had a similar experience as did others with the packaging of this product.  The box was literally falling apart when it arrived.  Luckily no parts were damaged.  On the plus side, the package arrived very quickly.

The bench has lots features for the price.  It was not difficult to assemble.  It folds up very nicely as advertised.  It is sturdy and easy to adjust.  This is a very good value

I purchased this bench about a year ago. I received it in 4 business days which I thought was really good. It took me about 45 minutes to put it together, there is alot of nuts and bolts, but once I finished assembly it has been a good machine, and I am still using it to do my weight lifting routines twice a week, it offers alot of different exercises, what I really love about it is the lat tower which alot of benches do not have until you get into the $300-$400.00 dollar range, which I was not willing to spend that much at the time. For the price of 129 bucks and the options you get, just can beat it. I am very happy with this machine. This machine is made by impex fitness and I definitely plan on upgrading to another impex when Im ready. Chris- V

My boy loves his drinking funtainer!  It has never spilled on his lunch box even though I have put it in different positions including upside down!  It it great because we can take it on a car ride and it will NOT spill all over the car if he drops it and it will keep his milk cold and even warm chocolate hot!  The straw that pops up when you open the lid is a plus and I have not had to replace it and the year is almost over!!  Very durable.  I love it and I'm planning to buy more!  It is well worth the money... and I bought it for $15.00!!

Recently we had a chance to use a Bongo Board about 40 years old. It was all wood with quite a large drum. The one we just purchased for my 8 year old daughter is great for many reasons. It is so portable that it has become a take it anywhere with you activity. The drum has an elastic cord so that it does not completely detach from the board when balance is lost, and balance is frequently lost. Finally we have had her friends try it and from initial angst to quickly getting the hang it has become a great confidence builder for them. Great investment for year round fun

I bought this stroller to replace my Combi-Ithru, but found that I needed to keep it.  Although this Schwinn stroller has proven to live up to its reviews has one slight draw back.  The recline position is a bit to far back for "mall strolling" making it a bit uncomfortable for the baby. Aside from that, the schwinn handles tough terrain like a Mercedes Benz or Cadillac.  Its great! Baby loves the outdoors and the comfort of this stroller.  It has ample room and keeps her protected from the elements.  It steers like a dream! Grandma loves the fact that it turns on a dime.  No extra effort needed. The big wheels and shock absorbers make it a smooth ride too for the sleeping baby.  My daughter is 13 months old, 24lbs and 32 inches tall and still has plenty of roomto grow into.  The stroller has great storage space below and the handle is height adjustable.  The only thing I don't really like is the upmost recline position is a bit to far back and seems uncomfortable for baby, the reason why I kept my Combi I-thru. Aside from that, I recommend it to anyone taking long walks in multiple types of terrain! This one can handle it all.  Happy Strolling.

The only thing that I don't like is that the seat cannot recline or can be made straighter. My husband tried to work something out, but the thing is that the manufacturer haven't thought about it

I just switched from a Suunto T6 to a T4 and this PC pod works seemless between the watch and PC. It is about 2x a paper clip and with the USB connection it is easy to carry.
Although a little pricy from the competition, if you want a system to track your running and easily monitor it the T4, Foot Pod and PC Pod work very well.
Down side is the software which does not support MAC, come on Suunto

 I am a dedicated martial artist that has been frustrated in my attempts to attain greater flexibility. Despite my previous instructor's claim that these types of machines are a waste of time & money, I decided to investigate the potential effectiveness of the "Versaflex". Based on this investigation, I purchased this machine & in the very short amount of time that I have used it, I am really happy. For me it makes stretching very relaxing & comfortable. I am very impressed!

I've tried lots of goggles, These are my favorite.  I didn't like the sponge goggles because the sponge was leaky and fell apart quickly.  And I remember the days when the one-piece goggles were popular but those never fit me very well.  These are adjustable: strap and comes with three nose pieces so you can get a custom fit.  And it's comfortable like the one-piece goggles and has a no-snag silicone strap.

This is exactly what I was looking for.  I had a very similar roller at my gym (Club One) and loved it, but left the gym a while ago.

A previous reviewer states that this product might be useless without the weight attachment.  Don't worry, it comes with it, and it works perfectly.  I interchange standard-sized weights all the time... have tested with up to 30lbs (30lbs is KILLER on your wrists, and I'm a fairly strong man)

If you want a gym-quality wrist roller, BUY THIS NOW

I am very happy with this product. It's made of the best material for speed and the timer beeps if you set it. 

I had initially rated this product with 1 star because it was twisting up so much that it became too short to jump over. But my brother fiddled with it and discovered that (unlike the rope in the picture) there should be a gap of the plastic rope so that it's not right up against the handle. So now I would give this product a 4 star rating because the manual should have mentioned it (and the sellers should have known that).

Great if you are serious with your kickboxing or any other martial art pad drills or sparring even!   Wrap easily and securely - nice and snug - real leather - soft but good padding and supports inside. Great wrist and fist supports upon impact!  I'd buy them again.. Need more color choices now.. :

On the advice of my chiropractor, I decided to buy an inversion table, but didn't want to spend a lot of money because I feared it would be yet another piece of equipment that would end up collecting dust in my spare room, along with my rowing machine and exercise bike.  So I purchased this Calm system because it was inexpensive and I figured I could sell it or send it back if I ended up not using it.

Well, so far I and my spouse have found it to be very good for relieving back pain, and best of all you don't have to spend a lot of time on the machine.  About 3 or 4 minutes a couple of times a day is all it takes to relieve lower back spasms and stretch out the spine.

Also, the machine is quite light weight and easily folds to shove in a closet or behind a wall unit.  Overall, I am pleasantly surprised and would recommend this system.  There is no need to spend a lot of money in order to experience the benefits of inversion therapy

Our very busy toddler (17 months old) is having a good time with this scooter.  It is very well made especially for the reasonable price.  The wheels do not scratch our wood floors, unlike some of her other toys.  She is our third and we have had our fair share of similar toys.  This one is one of the better ones.  The only down side is that it could be a little lower to the ground.  She is above average height and can just reach the floor well enough to push with her feet.  Our older girls were petitie and this would have been too big for them at the recommended age of 18 months.  Once they are in their twos, our girls have preferred trikes, so I'm also not sure how long this will last as a 'favorite', but it can definately be 'handed -down' or given to friends as it is going to last for years

We purchased the Razor Scuttle Bug Trike for our two year old daughter and she absolutely loves it!  She spends hours each day zipping around on it, and it is sturdy and lightweight. My only suggestion/complaint is that it is not adjustable in height.  She is a bit tall for her age, and it would be great if the legs extended a few inches. Would likely fit best for children ages 18 months - 2 1/2 years and under 35" tall.
Item comes pre-assembled and folds up flat.  Highly recommended

I struggled with the decision to buy this trike, thinking it seemed kind of cheap and plastic compared to the metal trikes of my youth. However, I ended up getting one for my 3 year old, and am going to order another for when my 1 year old is old enough. Whoever invented the rear handle steering mechanism is a genius, and me and my back thank them. I no longer live in fear of "daddy push me," since pushing doesn't require bending over to that terrible "pushing a tricycle" stance. The trike itself is lightweight and easy to maneuver. It has a low center of gravity and doesn't feel quite as tipsy as some. I recommend it

The Power Blocks are great if you don't have a lot of space to keep a full set of dumbells.  Changing weight is very easy and you can go change weight in 5 pound increments.  In addition to the 45 pound set, you can get an upgrade to increase the weight of each to 60 pounds (for around $150)

We just got this bike for my 4 1/2 year old.  It is a very sturdy bike that is easy for him to ride.  He is 45 inches tall and has about 1.5 inches clearance over the center bar.  On the box it said this bike could be used for children much shorter, but I don't see how.  It is a little bit of a struggle for him to get on the seat but once he is on he has no problems riding it.  Overall, the bike is very nice with 2 types of braking, a back pedal and hand brake.  The styling looks very nice and it arrived with no damage.  I would have given it 5 stars but the directions for putting it together were awful.  The enclosed directions were for bikes and features that this bike did not have and I was flipping back and forth trying to find relevant directions.  Putting it together is somewhat intuitive, and I did figure it out, but better directions would have been much appreciated.

I usually do not endorse a product as "a must have" due to the diversity of personal preference in not just air soft but the firearm community... however, this item is the only exception to my rule.  I got this speed loaded to compliment my MP5 with a 100-round drum and anyone with Carpel-Tunnel Syndrome can testify to, it's a real pain to load THAT much one at a time.  To satisfy this problem, enter the speed loader.

Pretty simple design and execution; open top hatch and insert up to 120 airsoft rounds, place nozzle on top of magazine and prime accordingly.  That easy.  Easily loads a 30-round magazine in less than three seconds.  It's inexpensive and easy to replace if it breaks... which it shouldn't unless you took it in the field and was dumb enough to put it in your front pouch and cracked it when you dove for cover.  Sounds ridiculous but I've seen it done by the Air Force guys I play with.

But let's face it; if you only have so many magazines/drums you're going to want a speed loader to make emergency quick-loads in the field and what better way than to carry it with you.  I strongly suggest you carry it in a side pouch; I carry mine in my BDU pant leg pocket below my hip holster for easy access although I try to carry more magazines in my tactical vest to avoid using it as a last resort.  I strongly recomend against placing it in a pouch in front of you like in a tactical vest since it's made of plastic, not metal.  

Lastly a warning; don't go too overboard with the primer.  Sometimes if you're not watching it you'll overload the magazine/drum and spray airsoft all over whereever you happen to be and either you've wasted ammo or you have to clean it up... unless you're at a friends house, let them clean it up.  ;

If it were possible, I would buy one of these for every airsofter in the world. YOU NEED THIS LOADER!!! Most guns come with those stupid loading tubes that require you to push the bbs down with a stick... That is the worst thing to use while youre getting shot at. This will speed up your loading time dramatically. BUY!!!!

First I want to make a slight correction to the previous reviewer's text: the size/weight of the gloves doesn't change according to the size of your hand but, rather, to the size of you, the user of the gloves. If you are an average sized male you will be hard pressed to find a sparring partner if you only have 10oz gloves: nobody in their right minds would agree to spar with you because with such small gloves the risk of injuring the receiver of the blows goes way up. Hence 16oz is the standard size for sparring gloves. Women can use 14oz and children 14oz and 12oz depending on how big they are. The point with heavier/bigger gloves is to protect your training partner. 
Anyway, on with the review: these are good, all-around sparring gloves. Their over-all quality is quite good and even the velcros are done well so you could use these for thai boxing as well without scratching your partner's neck and shoulders when clinching. However, I found that when you put more power behind your punches your knuckles tend to come through a bit so they're not the safest gloves around. Still they are good enough for pretty much anybody who's looking for a good pair of gloves for sparring. 
I recommend that you get a separate pair of bag gloves or 10oz gloves for bag and mitt work since hitting the heavy bag and focus mitts harden the leather which, again, makes the gloves more dangerous to use in sparring. Remember to wrap your hands and wrists when hitting the heavy bag in order to avoid knuckle, wrist, and shoulder injuries. 
Everlast is a good company and for the most part they make quality products. These gloves do what they are supposed to do

Similar to other reviewers, I was looking for a bench that I could do both abdominal and lower back work.  This was the only decent bench that fit the bill within this price range.  The construction is nice and sturdy, the assembly was no problem, and overall I'm very pleased.  The only thing keeping this from a 5 star rating for me is the lenghth.  I wish the main section were a foot longer, which would allow me to more easily use it with dumbells for chest work.  Although I do love how you can raise the thigh support for curls - I wouldn't have known to do that if it weren't for the photo on this site.  Bottom line: good value for a versatile bench

This bench was the best combination I could find that did both sit ups and hyper back exercises.  It works suprisingly well for what it costs.  The lower leg holder can be set low for back exercises, and set higher for sit ups.  The padding and covers seem decent.  Lots of adjustments.  It's not as heavy duty as the ones at gyms, but for at home I am satisfied

This bar is great when used properly, i.e. make sure the door is closed when you use it.  I was surprised how well it worked, much better than relying on someone to hold your feet while doing situps or cruches.

I recall first hearing about Bag Balm at an adult Scout Leader training retreat.  One of the participants started talking about Bag Balm and how he used it for everything from burns to lip balm.  Needless to say, I was intrigued and, upon returning from the retreat, did a little more investigating.

When I asked my wife whether she had ever heard of the stuff she immediately said that she had and that one of my toddler nephews was then using Bag Balm under a doctor's direction for pesky diaper rash.  I then began to question some of my horse riding buddies.  They too had heard of it and used it with very positive results.

I immediately went out and bought a big tin for my medicine cabinet and a couple of small more portable tins to keep around my office and car and use as lip balm.

I couldn't be more pleased.  I have used Bag Balm as an excellent lip balm and have used it on minor cuts and abrasions as well.  Rubbed directly into the skin.  Under Band-Aids. You name it. The stuff, as originally touted by my Scouting friend, seems also to have antibacterial properties.  Now, I am not a doctor and I don't play one on TV so please don't take that as some sort of prescription. 

Putting it in a nutshell, Bag Balm is incredible stuff and it works.  I highly recommend it!

I write very few reviews, but I just wanted to share my unbelievable success with healing my cracked heels.  I have fought this battle many years, with no success.  I started using this stuff 3 weeks ago, along with a heel sander, and I only have a small scar that I suspect will go away.  I cannot believe the results!!!  I only wish I had taken pictures to proof the results!!  But who wants to look at UGLY cracked heels???  LOL...it WORKS!!!!!!!!!

This has been used by our family forever! We use it on burns, diaper rashes, cuts on our animals, and just about any type of open wound--it works wonders! Plus, this trial-like size makes it perfect for the diaper bag, purse, drawer, or first aide kit

I have used this bench for a little over a week. For the price you can't go wrong. It is sturdy and seems to be well made. The adjustment is smooth and locks firmly in place. (Great for lying leg lifts). All and all this is a good bench, I would have given it five stars, but the description says it can be fully up right for use during military presses, this is not true, it can almost go vertical, but not completely.  Still, I think you would be happy with it, I am.

I got great results coaching 2 teams last season in 2006 using the Zip N Hit as a training aid in addition to live Batting Practice. We would work it into our routine for pre-game drills and starting practice drills.  With every player maybe getting another 20-25 swings at a moving ball at each practice and pre-game session, over a season it adds up to 200-300 extra swings that you can't get from live BP (which takes too long, you must retrieve balls).  Both of my teams last year batted as a team over 0.400 in both Bronco and Pony.  I had several players bat over 0.500 and 0.600, too. It also helped them develop a level swing which improves the Batting average, and become better situational hitters. Other opposing teams also began copying us. Perfect for pre-game warmups where you aren't allowed live BP, i.e. regular games, tournament games.  Our league is now buying one kit for every team in our league as basic equipment. The players can even help drill themselves.

Durability seems to be an issue.  The cord breaks or unravels much too quickly.  The sleeve inside the ball becomes grooved and slows the ball's travel on the cord.  A sleeve made of a harder, slicker material would improve both ball speed and reduce cord wear.  Possible materials are hardened aluminum, stainless steel (polished), teflon-based plastic or polycarbonate

I am a year-round bicycle commuter in Chicago who teaches classes on bike safety 
and riding with children.  I ride all the time at night, often with my kids
in tow.  We bought this as part of a set for my son's bike
two years ago.  It is absolutely phenomenal in it's visibility, durability, 
and ease of use!  I cannot recommend it enough.  I have something of a fetish 
about visibility when we ride our bikes at night.  I have bought just about 
every blinkie light out there.  This is my favorite, along with the Blackburn 
Mars tailight (with 7 LEDs including two amber side lights).  Mind you, the Mars 
is more than 3x the cost of this Bell light.  

Pros--
*extremely visible
*multiple flasher modes
*easy on/off feature for when you are locking up in a public place
*long battery life

Cons--
*the red shield can fall off when the bike is dropped or hits a hard bump.  
We solved this problem by putting a small piece of electric tape on the 
top edge

I bought an older model of the Petzl E32 P Myolite 3 Headlamp a couple of years ago for a trip to the Grand Canyon. Although it works well when on the move, whether for hiking at night, or finding your way to the water cooler or latrine, it has two drawbacks when using it in a fixed location:
- a: even when using the 3-leds (which is the less-bright option), it is so bright that one can not easily use it for reading, nor can one use it in ones tent without disturbing your tent-buddy.
- b: even when using the 3-leds it is so bright that it is difficult to use it to read, since it makes the white of the page reflect back at you.

Also, the weight is a bit heavy on one's head.

It is for these reasons that I just went out and bought the Black Diamond Zenix IQ for my upcoming trip to Yosemite. I have been playing with it in my apartment tonight (with the lights turned off), and I can already tell that this Black Diamond model is far superior to the Petzl I bought 2 years ago. The Zenix IQ has the following features:
- it is much lighter and more comfortable than the Petzel
- it has 6 brightness settings (as opposed to Petzel's 2): it has 3 settings for the two LEDs, and it has 3 settings for the ultra-bright bulb.
- it has a multi-function colored LED that acts as both a headlamp finder in the middle of the night (when you wake up and are looking for your headlamp), and as a battery meter to warn you ahead of time when your batteries are starting to get low

I had trouble getting water in my ears before wearing this cap.  Now no problem!  It keeps my hair fairly dry, or at least drier than with other caps I've tried.  It's easy to put on and take off--no hair pulling.  It's lasted well so far.  Much better than wearing a cap with a chin strap.

I highly recommend the Wenzel Raised Insta-Flex Air Bed over any other air bed out there.  I have had two other brands and Wenzel is the best.  Having a bad back, sleeping on an air mattress is not something I look forward to, but because of the height of this bed and just all around general quality, I have had no back problems and have slept great. The built-in air pump is a dream as well

I purchased a Coleman Exponent F1 Ultralight stove this past spring in preparation for a trip to the Cascades in Oregon. I have owned a liquid fuel stove for years (MSR Whisperlite purchased in approx 1992), and have loved it, but as I am getting older, I have been wanting to trim my pack weight down. I have found the following advantages to the F1 Ultralight.
#1. Easy to use. Simply unscrew the burner head, open the pan supports, screw the burner head back down, screw stove onto canister, light match, twist valve, and you are cooking with gas.
#2. No priming. The liquid fuel stoves required priming, and pumping, which made them harder to use than I would have expected. With this stove, you simply turn the valve and light. No waiting for the generator to heat up.
#3. Very light weight. The stove assembly itself weighs less than just the small fuel bottle for my liquid fuel stove alone. This thing is a feather on the back.
The disadvantages are there as well.
#1. Canister stoves rely on the low boiling point of the fuel to force fuel vapor up and out of the canister, and at temps close to, or below the boiling point, which is close to 0 fahrenheit, the stove simply will not work. For me, where and when I camp, this is not an issue.
#2. Fuel cannot be used as an emergency fire starter. 
#3. Fuel is EXPENSIVE compared to white gas, or unleaded gasoline. 
The owners manual claims this stove only works with Coleman Brand canisters, but I have found that any threaded canister of 70/30 Butane / Propane blend works. I have used Brunton, Coleman, MSR, and some odd black Canister I bought at a gas station in Oregon with it, all with excellent results..
Compared with other canister stoves such as the MSR Pocket Rocket, Brunton Optimus Crux, Snow Peak Giga Power Stove, or Primus Yellowstone Techno Trail, the Coleman Exponent F1 Ultralight had the design that made the most sense to me, sported the lowest weight (.4oz lower than its nearest competitor), and from what I was able to determine in impromptu in store testing, appeared to have the best pot stability of the group, with pot supports that spread out nice and wide. One tidbit about this however is... The Evernew 1.3L Titanium cookpot, is oddly shaped on the bottom, and sits and a slightly odd angle on the F1. I have tried many other pots and this is the only one I have a problem with. The issue is whith the oddly dimpled bottom of the Evernew pot, and NOT with the Coleman stove...
SUMMARY. If you camp where the temps aren't freezing, low weight, ease of use are important, and cost of fuel is unimportant, then this is the stove for you. However you must carry some other sort of emergency fire starter in lieu of having stove gas to start wet wood. If however the cost of fuel is going to be a factor for you, or you are going to go mountain climbing, or whatever, you will want to bypass any canister stove at all, and just go with a gasoline model instead. The Coleman F1 Ultralight is the lightest of the group of stoves I had considered, had the best design, and came in at a price point that I liked. For the majority of backpackers out there, I would say this would be the best stove for you.

The BEST Creatine + Nitric Oxide workout surge

The two most respected bodybuilding supplements are (1)Whey Protein and (2)Creatine. They are also considered natural products or food products. While whey is without a doubt extremely useful, creatine does not help everybody. I have used creatine monohydrate in the past and I found it to be useless. It was so utterly ineffective that I just felt robbed of my hard earned money. My tub still sits in the cupboard. I have never used any other supplement products other than the ones that seem to be on the safe side as these both are. I heard about NO-XPLODE from some bodybuilders who seemed to think it was probably one of the best supplement products to come out in years. I researched it and it appears that BSN has formulated a surging "Creatine + Nitric Oxide" drink that seems to work with most people. Not everybody sees results but this stuff worked for me and that is what counts. Although NO-XPLODE contains some serious chemistry (see below) and possibly some debatable compounds (Guanidino Propionic Acid [GPA] and Glycocamine) it is probably well worth the very low-level risks for the results. 40 minutes after taking this stuff I can either cardio high intensity for 30 min flat (maybe even more) and complete a full range of compound weight lifts in the gym without feeling any interruption in my power. No fatigue. The surge is exactly as it promises. You will feel that you have nitro pumping around your body. It sets in at about 20 minutes for me. I feel a little woozy at first, disorientated, then my brain picks up and my body feels energetic. Put it into action and you will see results.  It also boats a CEM3 type of creatine that prevents you from bloating up like monohydrate does. I never have stepped much outside of what is considered safe but in my opinion NO-XPLODE is standing on the fence saying I am about the best bang for your buck without any serious side effects. So far this stuff is getting very good feedback. Yes it contains lots of mind boggling ingredients, but if you are looking for the creatine edge, even if creatine has never worked for you before, then NO-XPLODE is probably the one. It can also help build muscle, but even if it doesn't for you, it is still worth it for the surge. I am very glad that I got it. Very.

it is very good luggage carrier to withstand the weather conditions - since i used it in the trip when i started it was raining n not drop of water could enter through it and i was worried since i had all my clothes packed in it.
it is very convient to install n uninstall with enough capacity to fit your things in it

First off, let me start by saying that I really like my Summit watch.  It is large (some may go so far to call it HUGE) but it is surprisingly lightweight on my wrist, and quite comfortable to wear.  Those with bad eyesight will STILL be able to see the easy-to-read digital readout of the time, barometric pressure, altitude and compass.  The numbers are quite big, so they are difficult to miss.  

The altitude reading measures in increments of +/- 1 foot, which is about as good as you can get.  I like that.  But what I really like about the Highgear watches that I haven't seen in other brands which offer similar features, is the visual image on the face of the watch telling you what the weather conditions are or will be.  No kidding, this watch will actually show you whether or not it is sunny, partly cloudy, or raining.  Pretty dang nifty if you ask me.  The barometric pressure reading is only a small part of predicting the weather, however after months of use, I have to say that my little watch is WAY MORE accurate than my local TV Weatherman.  I'd say somewhere around 75% of the time what my watch says is exactly what the conditions actually ARE.  Not bad.  It's a feature I would VERY much like to have on my Suunto and Casio models with similar functions.  Until then, I'll rely on my trusty (and much cheaper) Highgear Summit.

If you are considering making the purchase of a wrist watch that offers the digital compass, altitude and barometer functions, before MAKING that specific buy, do some homework and wherever possible, seek out a store where you can actually SEE the watches in person.  Being able to guess the size of a particular model using a picture on the computer can possibly mess up your purchase.  Find the best price, and pull the model out and actually TRY IT ON before you buy.  For me, the Highgear Summit was a good purchase -- however if you would rather enjoy these same functions but in a smaller package, try the Highgear Axis, or possibly the more stylish but much more compact (and WAY MORE expensive) Suunto Observer.  Either way, doing a little homework will pay off in the end.  Happy hiking and I hope this helps you in your efforts to buy the right product.  Good luck

My middle school daughter was always struggling to fit her books in her old backpack which, up until this year worked fine.  I went on-line to find the roomiest one I could, and still get style, color choices and outside pockets. We were amazed at how much room this had inside.  Now all her books fit nicely, and she loves the extra pockets so she can easily find her lunch, pens & pencils, her cell phone and other 'extras'

I have ridiculously large books and a half hour walk to and from the train station each day.  Unlike every other backpack I've tried, the straps of this one have yet to start ripping or fraying apart from the bag.  The only feature I miss is a buckle connecting the two straps across the front of the chest, so they don't pull apart at the shoulders.  However, the bag is heavy-duty and roomy, and I'm easily able to fit my laptop, Con Law book (maybe the largest book ever made), Crim Law book (2nd largest ever), and pocket dictionary.  Overall, if you can get as good a price as I paid for it, I would recommend it to any student or other user..

I've been kicked out of two country clubs for using the Butthead Golf Club Cover, and it appears the only club that allows my membership has been Playworld Putt Putt. There's also no dress code involved there.

Now, on to the review!

I strongly endorse this Butthead Golf Club Cover because it adds an element to golf that would otherwise be forgotten: fun! Those teets really help my handicap like you wouldn't believe. Many clubs have a problem with this cover, because they're incredibly elitist, but when I think of golf, I think of cow teets, and that's why I refuse to play without it

I used mine for two weeks snorkeling in Hawaii. It isn't perfect. It does take on a little bit of water sometimes when you go below the surface, but it isn't enough to cause any problems.

It is pretty easy to clear by just giving a hard quick blow. You probably won't find anything better

I got this gear bag and love it.  It doesn't have a lot of the features you'll see in higher-priced bags; its really just a durable mesh duffle bag, but its great for someone who has a lot of gear they want to carry, and perfect for couples who just want to tote their fins, boots, masks, snorkels, and any other small gear like defog, gloves, knives, wrist compasses/computers, etc

I have used the bottle to take tasty beverages with me on the road, while playing sports, to drink while I am in class.  The bottle washes easily in the dishwasher.  The narrower profile fits easily in cup holders.  I highly reccommend the N-Gen.  It is much larger than 24 oz.  If you fill it all the way to the top you have nearly a quart of capacity.  It is the best functioning and looking drink bottle on the market.  You can also use the bottle as I have to pack small items which you want to be slightly more secure while traveling by air and also keeping some items out of the rain in your backpack.

I bought this croquet set late last summer for backyard get-togethers with the neighbors. None of us had played before, so we didn't need top-of-the-line, and the price was right on this set. It's everything it needs to be: weighty, colorful, and compact in its case. The widgets are pretty bendy, but if they bend out of shape, they bend right back. Turned out to be a good investment. A word of warning if you have small dogs: put them in the house before you let your neighbors loose with mallets and round projectiles. My little dachshund picked up the bad habit of chasing the balls and pushing them further off-course. It was funny, until she darted into the path of one bright orange ball, which made solid contact with her little head. (She's fine now, but is no longer a fan of the game.) All in all, I would highly recommend having a set like this around if you have the room in your backyard and fun neighbors

I don't usually select items by &quot;name brand&quot;, so I tried many other boots before I tried the Timberlands.  But none seemed as well constructed or was as comfortable.  I have had them for 4 months and they have proved waterproof (in rain and puddles, thus far) and have shown very little wear

Timberland's are in no matter what the season.. I mean you can wear them with a pair of khaki shorts in the summer or all your tight winter gear.  You know you can't have just one pair or one color so just go ahead..get them

Some people talk trash on this gun, and on how it's not upgradeable. First of all, if you can find a better gun for 85 bucks, I'd be amazed. Second of all, for just .89 cents, you can buy some teflon tape, and wrap up the hop-up receiver, boosting you another 70 fps. Search online for tutorials. Second, There is a tightbore barrel out, which will boost you only about 20 fps, but greatly increase your accuracy. UTG also has a drop-in cylinder upgrade coming out. So, there are upgrade, they just require manual labor, and you can't just buy them ready to go. If you're willing to put time into your gun, it'll be well worth it. I love this gun. I'm shooting abou

I have been practicing mixed martial arts for four years,and I have gone through all of the major glove brands. In my opinion, Everlast has always provided gloves that provided the most effective wrist support, which means less twisted wrists, especially for beginners. Everything else is well done, but not exceptional - it's comfortable, and provides durable padding, although I myself have only used the 16 oz. versio

Assembles easily and doesn't take up much space.  The quality is good, but I don't think it's strong enough for heavy use.  It's great for small workouts in front of the TV, though.

I didn't know what to expect, but these turned out to be very good quality.  They stretch well and return to shape.  They don't feel like they are going to snap apart when you are in the middle of exercising.  I was very pleased with the product.  Be careful, though, if you have a latex allergy.  I also got excellent service from the company!  I would definitely do business with them again

This step is great.  It really adds variety to my home workout.  I use it on carpet and it really stays put.  It doesn't slip on the carpet, and I don't slip when I step on it.  I was a little worried because it didn't have a rubber stepping surface, but it really doesn't need it with regular athletic shoes

I have arthritis (psoriatic), diabetes, high blood pressure, heel spurs and Osteopenia (a pre-Osteoporosis state)and I'm 240lbs. A real grab-bag of conditions to deal with! I saw what happened when my Mother broke her hip and I really didn't want to have that happen to me. But, how to exercise? Using a warm "therapy" swimming pool was about the only exercise I could do and that will not provide the weight-bearing exercise needed to re-form bone. Just walking around is cheap, but I'm a female and my neighborhood is not really well-lit and has gone downhill a bit, too. I just didn't feel safe walking around at 2:am or whenever *I* was up for exercise. Besides there were hazards like uneven pavement, high curbs and all the issues of weather to deal with. I had seen the ads on TV for the Gazelle line of exercise equipment and it seemed to be ideal for me. I could exercise my knees and hips in regular gravity conditions or add resistance if I needed to, without any arthritis-taunting up and down impact on my joints. No more worries about where I was stepping and into what. I could exercise whenever I wanted and not disturb anyone in the neighboring apartments. I could go as "far" as I liked and wouldn't have to worry about being exhausted from going too far from home and not being able to make it back.

So, I got the Gazelle and I LOVE it!
I chose this model (The Power Plus)for my use but also because my best friend is 340lbs and this will take up to 350lbs. From the way it is constructed - which is very strong and SOLID, I'm not sure that's really it's upper limit. This is not some flimsy, cheaply constructed rip-off.  It does not move, sway or "walk" when I use it. Yet, with the handles on the side, I'm able to lift the back of the Gazelle up onto the front wheels and move it fairly easily, which really suprised me since it is such a heavy-duty machine.

Any downsides? It did have a small bit of squeaking at first, but it never got to the point where I'd be worried that I was disturbing anyone. Because it is built so solid, it does command a bit of space. Not too much, but it is not a model that will fold up so you'll need to commit room for it and enough room for the swinging motion. I'd want to safety-fence off around it to protect pets and kids from getting too close when it's in action.

Over-all I am VERY pleased with this item!
Well done, Fitness Quest

I bought one of these, based from a review. I pretty much agree with her, the machine is great and it gives a good workout. But she forgot to mention, the thing can cause your feet to get sore! I tried wearing high quality running shoes and it still hurt. I received an advice to attatch foam strips to the runners that you stand on, and that has solved the problem! So far, I have not used the pistons, so it's just a cardio workout. I have Tony's tapes he sells on his website and his music cd's, and I do get a very good workout! I have lost 13 pounds so far by using it, and I noticed it defanitely toned up the buns

There's not a lot of information out there on using this extractor for cars, because I think most people buy it for boats instead.  So I'm going to talk about how well it works on changing the oil in your car.

In summary, it works great.  It's really nice being able to change your oil on your own time and at your own home without getting dirty.  I'm never going to Jiffy Lube again.  It even works great on my lawnmower.

Using the extractor is very easy.  Just remove your dipstick, insert the extractor's tube into the dipstick hole until the end reaches the bottom of the oil pan (it might take some practice to get a feel for this part).  Once everything is in place, pump 10-20 times.  This will cause a the extractor to suck out the oil like a straw.  It takes about 15 minutes for 3 quarts.  That's also why I recommend the 6-liter model instead of the 2.5-liter one, so that you can suck out all the oil in one shot.

Some people wonder whether all of the oil is removed this way.  Unfortunately, I can't really speak to that, because that would require me to open the drain plug and investigate.  However, the consensus from stuff I've read on the Internet is that the extractor does remove as much oil as the traditional method.

Because changing my oil is so easy with the extractor, I always change my oil on time.  Previously, I drove for thousands of miles past my "due date" because stopping for an oil change was too inconvenient.  The extractor should be used after the engine has been running.  The oil is less viscous and the contaminants are stirred up, making the extractor more effective.

Also, please remember that your old oil must be properly recycled.  Most mechanic shops will accept your old oil (I put it in a plastic orange juice container), just call ahead to make sure

The plastic side mounts (4) appear to be solid and not flimsy.  I replaced the 12 supplied screws with actual stainless steel ones, (you know, since this is going on a boat!) But at least the hooks to attach the cooler are stainless.  The package says "includes all stainless mounting fasteners" So I guess that means hooks only.  The supplied screws are not even galvanized. So if you plan to affix these mounts permanently to a boat, go get stainless screws that are also 1/2" longer than the ones provided.
All in all it's a nice kit but a little pricey for what you get

First off I need to tell you that I've carried a swiss knife since I was a kid. I have most of the styles. But this one stands out as the absolute most useful for a rather strange reason. For me since I don't fish I found more uses for this in the most unexpected area. The "fish scaler" tool is one that I would NEVER use to scale fish for no other reason than the problem of having to clean it thoroughly, too much work. But this tool I have used more than any other on all my knives. I've used it to open ceiling hatches to change office lights, pick locks. to measure things (something you need more often than you think), to reach into thin areas to clear debris or push a switch and most of all as a back scratcher. Since there are no sharp edges on the scaler it's perfect to scratch those areas one can't reach. That's not to ignore all the rest of the tools this knife offers which I use except for the absurd "parcel hook". This tool is useless and yet Victorinox continues to install it on many knives. The only useful task I've found for the hook is to tighten one's laces on my boots when I snow shoe. Anyone else found something useful for the parcel hook? Please post it if you have

This paddle is a bargain here at Amazon.  Sports stores would easily sell this for over $20.  Having said that, I found it to be slightly heavier and the thicker sponge made it difficult for me to adjust my game.  "BUT", I still eliminated many a younger player at our men's retreat.  There's nothing better than seeing the face of a 23 year old when a 53 year old kicks his rear!  Thanks, Stiga

These bands were recommended by our son's summer camp and we were quite skeptical about them.  But they seem to be working very well and are comfortable to wear.  Our son likes them much better than the sprays and smelly lotions that we used to use and never really worked.  Before using these bands, his legs and arms were covered with bites.  We are very pleased with them and highly recommend them to others

After polishing alloy wheels I treated them with Boeshield. It leaves a waxy film that attracts dust and dulls the finish, however there is no sign of tarnish or oxidation. Very easy to clean off when you want really bright wheels

This is a great bike.  I gave one to my 2 and4 year old to share for Christmas.  It is winter here so they ride it through the house all the time.  My son has really struggled with 2 wheel bikes because the typical bike easily crashes when you turn the handle bars too hard.  This bike is made so the turning radius is very small. The bike is light enough that he just picks it up a little to make a big turn.  No problem. He goes sailing through the house now with NO crashing.  Once the weather is good enough to go outside he is going to have a ball.  He will definately graduate to a standard bike after this teaches him balance.  He should be able to skip the obnoxious training wheels altogether.   
My short 2 year old loves it but she has to go slowly because she can barely reach the floor.  In a few months she should be fine and I'm guessing by this summer she'll be sailing on it.   GREAT FUN.   Unfortunately the price is very hard to swallow.  I found one on sale through a design website so I could manage it.   If the money won't bankrupt your budget or you can save for it, it's worth it

This is the second Vector I have purchased.  My first six year old one has gotten beat up and the compass no longer works.  The watch has a large dial and is a little bulky, but you get used to it.  You trade that for a large easy to read dial.  The watch has more features than you can use and a large instruction manual to go with it. It has the compass, barometer, temperature, and altimeter.  The 6 hour barametric pressure history box is nice to warn you of incoming bad weather.  The watch is a nice instrument, but I would warn against abusing it. It is shock resistant, not shock proof

This may be the 'outdoorsy' ubergeek watch. It's big, it's ugly, but has functions to make the fattest Swiss Army Knife sit in the corner sobbing in jealousy. Overall, I like it but there are a couple of things that sound better than they are. 

The timepiece: Outstanding. It has HH:MM:SS DD:MMM, of course, with a year setting to avoid leap year issues. This should go without saying in a modern digital watch. Stopwatch with lap function (not that I ever use the lap function, but I'm sure someone is interested). Countdown timer that can run up to a 24 hour countdown (very easy to set). Three daily alarms. Special kudos for the alarms, this is one of the loudest watch alarms I've heard, and I've missed too many watch alarms to not appreciate this. 

The Altimeter: largely eye candy, but kind of neat. Over four days, my bedroom went from 100m above sea level to 25 m below sea level (by the maps, about 40m ASL). Not surprising because it is driven by the barometer, and I never recalibrated it, but a graphic demonstration of the importance of calibrating it when you want/need it. 

The Barometer: Yup, it's a barometer. The part I like is the little display that shows the rising/falling trend, especially as this is always active (even in normal 'time' mode). 

The Thermometer: Take the watch off to get an accurate reading as the sensor is too close to the wrist. 

The compass: Easily the best 'special' feature. Accurate, precise (enough for orienteering, not for surveying), easy to use. It can be programmed for a declination, but knowing me, I'd forget to reset it, so I do declination the hard way. The sighting notches are small but servicable. The spirit level bubble is unique among digital watch compasses to Suunto, and greatly enhances accuracy and confidence in the compass. An outstanding wrist compass. 

The package: Big. Really, really big. But the controls are very easy to use and seem fairly resistant to accidental button pressing (a problem for me with other watches). The battery has a shortish (12-18 month) life, but has a hatch, so you don't need to take it to a jeweller to get it replaced without ruining the water resistance. The display has large characters and high contrast to the back ground, and the display light is just right, readible, even, and glare free, but not an emergency flashlight. Personally, I'm going to swap the resin band for a velcro strap, but the stock strap isn't bad, just not great. 

Overall, not a watch for the office or a suit but very good as a watch, compass and barometer, and about what you could expect as a thermometer and altimeter. Well designed, thought-out, and manufactured, but really big.

I purchased the Kwik Kik for my 11-year-old to use as a training aid for the recreational soccer program he is involved with.  It was fairly easy to put together and, once the base is filled with sand (it cannot be filled with water), it's simple to move it from place to place.  The Kwik Kik is a great way to build up the strength and stamina in his feet and legs!  I love the fact that he can use it either in-doors or out-doors, so he'll be able to use it to keep training throughout the year.  Great Product

Very high quality/durability. This glove works well as it should. Only complaint (splitting hairs here) is that it gets pretty hot pretty fast, and your hand will sweat. If you are an extreme sweater, you may want to sacrifice the quality construction of this glove for one that is more well ventilated.

I've owned my first pair of "Big Grip" gloves for over three years now and they're still in great shape (for a time I was lifting four times a week).  I only bought a second pair to keep in reserve in case Harbinger discontinues them.
The only down side for me is the finger length.  The glove's fingers, at least on my hands, end right at the second joint and are mildly annoying when you bend you fingers until the gloves break in.  After that, though, they're great

We purchased this item for our 15 year old daughter when we spent a week in the Keys. The DVD gave her a good overview of how to use the mask/snorkel. The mask and snorkel were of good construction and kept water out. This was a great product and a good price for what we needed and used it for.

I thought the speedsafe was a button that you press which flings the knife open.  I was dissapointed to find that it is just a spring that helps it open faster.  Other than that, this knife is ultra high-quality, definately the best I have owned

I hate to feed into the mentality that causes knifemakers to hype their blades as "tactical," because the last thing we need to give lawmakers is another excuse to heroically protect us by banning the tools we carry. But the first and last thing I have to say about the Ken Onion Tactical Blur is that it is one fearsome knife.

A curved blade would be suited to your usual cutting and slicing applications, such as skinning mastodons and so on. This knife, on the other hand, has a chisel-like tanto point, which is ideal for thrusting effortlessly through beef ribs or car hoods. It would be equally at home cutting up cardboard boxes, linoleum flooring, or metal garbage cans.

Technically, this isn't a switchblade. Switchblades are bad. We know this because our lawmakers have heroically protected us by effectively banning them at various levels. This is only an ordinary liner-lock knife with spring-assisted opening. But if I ever found a switchblade with the deployment speed and cutting power of the Blur, I'd say it was quite a knife.

The blade is shaving-sharp from the factory, and the handle is lightweight but sturdy aluminum with some kind of gritty sandpaper-like stuff glued on to give a better grip should the knife become slippery with any sort of fluid. Use your imagination. I haven't tried shattering any cinderblocks with it yet, but it's sturdy enough to use as a yawara stick in a pinch.

Folded, the whole package can be palmed even in my small hands and feels much like a disposable lighter with a glandular problem. I don't even notice it in my hip pocket, which is where it rides whenever I happen to be wearing pants. 

If walking around with something this fearsome seems too naughty for you, remember a couple of things. One is that you can buy it from The Wall for $55, and The Wall would not sell naughty things to naughty people. Another is that crimes, to my knowledge, are not generally committed with knives like these, but with such evil implements as kitchen knives, screwdrivers, and whatever happens to be lying around near the crime scene. Lastly, you will probably not need a knife this fast and ferocious, but if you do, you will *really* need it. And you'll have it

I had my knife for 10 years, and would still have it, if not for the 2nd instinct of putting it in my back pocket whenever I leave the house. One night I was heading for a flight, at the airport, going thru security; when I realized I had it on me, I had no choice but to throw it out. So had to get another one

Quick shipping/ but poor packaging. There was obvious chips of metal from the structure in the packaging and one of the main SCREW and BOLTS pagackages were already open (lucky i found all) Bad packaging BUT EXCELLENT bench. It takes a decent bit of assembly but it fit perfect in my 2 car garage and still lets 1 car in. Great multi-function product. You can do all core lifts and also do lats and curls to build the minor muscles for definition. Pretty sturdy structure but seems a tad bit hallow (no problems yet) for a hundred fifty five bucks with free shipping (another 155 value) It was REALLY worth it. I say to anyone who likes it, its worth it. Just get it. Wether your a pro or beginnger its good for getting stronger and adding mass

I bought this bike after not riding since I was 14 (32 now).  The box arrived in excellent condition and the bike was nearly completely assembled.  I also had a little trouble with adjusting the front brake but got it figured out.  Overall this is a great bike for those casual trips around town.  I'm not a trail seeker, so have never tried it off road.  Very happy with the quality and ease of assembly

The bike was delivered 70% (rough guesstimate) put together. It was relatively easy to complete myself (only had to use manual a few of times) and i'm certainly no expert.

The only problem I encountered, was getting the front brake pads to align properly on the tire. With that being said.... I spent a few dollars at our local bike/cycle shop to have it looked over (basic tune-up service) to make sure it was safe to ride.

The bike now rides nicely and serves as my cruise around town bike. Overall, I think this is good value for the money... but only if you're looking for a hybrid type bike for shorter (more casual) trips

I take power or ashtanga based classes 3 times a week.  So when I travel on business taking a mat along isn't the best plan.  So I purchased these and when I traveled they were great on the hotel carpet.  I read some of the other reviews that they aren't durable and I don't think these were designed for everyday use.  Regardless, I love them for travel or when I can't make it to the yoga studio

The one I bought is green and black - looks good in the water. I first look this kayak (dingy really) out into the Gulf of Mexico. The swells were two two three feet and the harder I paddled the behinder I got. I thought I had made a bad purchase but then I took the dingy into Clearwater Bay with much calmer waters and I'm having the time of my life. 

Paddling is slow going - 2 to 3 miles per hour at most but I've gone a couple of miles and back all along the bay. I bought a Coleman pump that runs on 4D batteries and I can inflate and deflate it five times before I need to change batteries. This kayak is the best $70 I've ever spent. Great exercise too

The pedometer is just too sensitive!!  It tends to over state the number of steps that I have taken. I like the item but I cut the number of steps that I have taken by third.  So, if I am tageting 10,000 steps a day I try to go 13,333 so that I can be sure that I really hit my target. The item itself is well made, light weight and easy to use and set.

I've purchased 3 tubes of this brand.  The product works as advertised.  I have bigger thighs and use it to prevent chafing while I'm walking around at work.  This product is especially a lifesaver during the hot summer months.  There are other brands on the market, but this is far the best value I have found.  Thank you Sportslick, keep making your product and if it's not selling, find different distribution channels

This is a nice sword for $35 (plus tax). When I removed the sheath, there was some sort of goo on the blade (probaby so it wouldn't rust). This is a carbon blade, so don't leave it in a moist closet for 1 or 5,376 years(by then the rusted blade alone will be worth a fortune). Just dont get the blade wet, ok. You can rub a moist towel across it to get rid of the rust protector if you're going to use it often but that is pretty much all you can do to clean it without a special kit. Please dont brandish this sword around like a bad actor in a kung-fu movie. You could realy hurt someone with the point of the blade. I think this is shipped over seas, so dont challenge your friend to a violent battle the day after you buy this and you should be fine. Blue Dragon is actualy a japanese video game that no one bought. I think it was based on a part of final fantasy 2. I don't want to bore you with video games, so i'll get to the point. Put it on display, dont cut your lawn with it, dont play ninja with it, and dont ever ever ever ever ever ever try to cut a solid object in half with it (prefrebly a tin can) because the cheap blade could fly off the tang and hurt you (or prefrebly your neibor) in the face. Please don't throw the blade at your neibor either. P.S. I am not neil meislin, I am his son, daniel meislin. If you can't understand my numerous perenthesis, I guess you're not smarter than a 5th grader.

I mainly got this watch so that it would be easier to orient myself if I was lost or giving direction via the compass but now that I have it I wouldnt know what I would do without it. A Great Purchase

The dials/gages appear to be very good quality and look very nice.  They are very accurate as far as I can tell in comparing them to my LaCross Clock/Weather gage and the local weather reports and web reports.

The Hygrometer may be off by 2% but am not convinced this is true as yet and I can adjust it.

I set the barometer to +1.1" for my 1050' above sea level.

I wish the clock was not a loud tick tick tick.  It is not that bad, but I would rather not have that at all as my ears very easily pick up on things like that.

The one thing I do not like is that I should have checked the dimensions of it.  I am not sure if they were listed when I bought it.  So check the size of what you think you life before you purchase.  This one seems a little small.  Not the gages but the mounting board.  It could be a little wider and a little taller.

I also, somehow messed up on buying one that had such a boring mounting board.  I would have liked a beveled arch on the top or such.  The wood is good quality and the varnish appears to be top notch.  I don't mark down for this.

I mark down for the size of the mounting overal as it could be taller and wider.  Not buy much, but maybe an inch wider and 2' taller.

Overal I like it alot.  I just did not realize how plane jane it was in mounting and size.

The Ultrastar is a classic disc, wonderful to throw and catch.

I personally feel that Ultrastars vary based on the color, but I just may be imagining things.

These fly better than the average Whammo, although I feel that I can throw 180g Innova Pulsars a little bit further. Still, the Ultrastar has more curvature and has a nice stable flight pattern.

I've thrown the Adidas 175g as well, and while that is not as bad as a beat-up whammo, it's still not quite the same

You owe it to yourself to own a flashlight made using the Cree XR-E LED.  It's roughly TWICE as bright as the currently comparable Luxeon LED.  Also, the "regulator" circuitry keeps the light at a fairly constant level through the life of the battery (not all LED flashlights have this feature).  It's small enough to be put on a keychain, yet puts out a powerful beam

I already owned a Fenix P1 which amazed me with the impressive light it threw from something so tiny.  It was easily small enough to fit on my key chain and so it is always with me.  Even a great light source is useless if it's not accessible when you need it.  I owned a Surefire Ultra which is a great flashlight but obscenely expensive.  But you could feel the quality and knew it would last a few decades.  I love the rear clicky button design and the 5 levels of light.  I expected some similar design elements in this new Fenix. I was disappointed to see that to switch to the different settings you have to screw the collar left right, then left right again and so on.  So if there is one setting you use most often, you must go through the whole 5 turns just to get back to it next time.  Come on, that's just stupid.  I will keep it only to avoid the exchange hassle and it still is a good value considering the size and light output especially compared to the uberpriced surefires.  But there is no comparison as far as construction or quality. So 4 stars is all I could muster for the crude setting selection method design and the adequate but toylike feel of the casing construction.

I bought one of these lanterns three years ago at the local discount store.  I have used it numerous times on camping expeditions.  It outputs very bright light at full blast.  The lantern is quick to light and the best part is it does not require matches.

The only three issues I have with this lantern are:
1. Sucks the propane.  I also have the coleman fuel lantern, and while it is not as bright, it can go for a week of camping on one tank (5 cups) of fuel.  
2. Loud.  This lantern is loud when burning.  The above mentioned lantern is much quieter.
3. Construction -- the fiberglass (?) base around the knob has disintegrated from my thumb rubbing it when trying to light the lantern.  Hopefully this will not affect the longevity of the lantern.

I'd recommend it if you are looking for convenience and bright light, but if you are looking for value, go with the old dual mantle coleman fuel (pump up) lantern.

If you are out in the cold and its important for your hands to be warmed then you need these hand/pocket warmers!

They are even great for just being outside for a walk!  I have poor circulation and MUST keep my hands warm to avoid pain and these warmers do the trick

I was/am a runner who constantly was sustaining leg injuries of one type or another.  I finally yielded to the fact that I needed to seriously cross train and reduce my running.  I decided to row, however I abhore having to spend tons of cash on exercise equipment to work out indoors when running is virtually free outside.  I originally wanted to spend only a few hundred dollar so at least I could get my work outs in and see if I really liked rowing.  After reading every review I could find, I decided that it may be in my best interest to spend more than a few hundred dollars.  When I chose the Body Craft VR100 rower I figured that I would still be compromising quality since it was a mid-priced unit.  I didn't want to listen to things click and clack, and have to tighten things that would loosen over time. Much to my amazement, this rower Rocks!  It was really easy to put together, the parts are high quality, and the important thing is when you row you don't even think about the fact that you are on a machine.  It's solid, steady, smooth, and a great workout.  I use it 4-5 days a week for 45 mintues each time and have had it for about 1 month.  It feels just as good as the day I bought it.  If you are thinking about purchasing a rower, I highly recommend this one.

This is the Harbinger you need unless you are going to be power lifting only then I suggest you look into the 12xx series but they are for very quick lifts and not for wearing more than ten minutes because they are like wearing boxing gloves. If you want to spend time in the gym lifting say the big three like squats, deadlifts and bench presses for a couple of sets then the Harbinger 140 Pro WristWrap Glove is exactly 100% what you need. I would never, and I mean never, buy another glove again simply on the bases that every other type of glove I have used has split within two months of use while Harbinger just lasts through deadlift upon deadlift upon deadlift and looks as good as the day I bought them. The wrist strap is a really nice touch, very long and wraps around and around to keep those wrists nice and firm for the big lifts. You go to the gym and you want a pair of gloves that will support you and last longer... look no further. Buy them

The Firm just keeps getting better and better!  They're products are WONDERFUL!  I've been using The Firm videos for a looooong time and I LOVE them!!  The cardio-weight training does wonders for your body!  Now with the TransFirmer system, this is definitely a challenging workout - even for me and I've been an advanced exerciser for over 20 years.  I love the incline step...you can really feel the difference.  You can also increase the intensity or you can do it less intense as well. It gives you great variety with the height of the step, weights, incline, etc.  THIS IS AN AWESOME WORKOUT...I LOVE EVERY DVD!!  Very challenging and I'm am very happy I bought this.  The step is wonderful and very sturdy!  This is the only step you'll ever need...for all your Firm workouts!

I would give this 3.5 stars if possible. Its a decent table, the chip holders/with cup holders are easy to rearrange accoring to preference. The Table itself seems to be a piece of plywood, with some green felt tacked both sides of it; and slots cut out for the chip trays. 

It works, but could have been a nicer, better made product for the money. 

Watch out for the shipping costs,  almost 1/3 the price of the table. Pretty expensive

For some reason the electronic control panel doesn't work on my bike.  But I don't mind too much.  The bike is small and light but has enough mass so it doesn't slide around.  I use the bike while doing work, watching TV or reading.  It's a great way to get exercise on rainy days

I am not an exercise person.  But, I need to keep moving and others in my family have bone issues that mean they shouldn't exercise in a manner that stresses the joints.  This machine is perfect for all of us.  I put the machine together and found it to be quite sturdy and fairly heavy.  The electronics on it are working just fine.  It's the kind of exercise machine that I can get on, watch TV, and forget I'm actually exercising

The product works as anticipated.  I was disappointed that the packaging was missing golf tips that were advertised as being included.  This advertising was imprinted on the product's box so it was not just a stick-on label afterthought.  I think someone tampered with the box before shipping

...or shall we shag later?  Now if they could figure out how to tee the ball up for me I wouldn't have to bend over at all!  But seriously, I find this product to be a vast improvement over the old shag stick that I was using.  I haven't used it on real grass though, just on the practice mat and net I have set up in my garage.  Given the consistent way the Shag Pro serves 'em up, I think it would also work fine out back

This is a good jogger if you will be using it for more than just jogging.  I really like the fact that it has a front swivel wheel that you can lock for jogging and unlock if you need more manuverability.  It comes with cup holders, which is nice because a lot of joggers you need to puchase them as an accessory.  Overall it is a good stroller, the only thing that I would change in the design would be the wheel locking feature.  It has 2 individual locks, one for each wheel.  The jogger I had previously had a bar across the back that would lock both wheels at the same time when pressed.  I am extremely satified with the stroller for the price at which I purchased it

I bought this stroller after much research and deliberation.  It is comfortable for my [...]as well as my [...]daughter.  It handles wonderfully. It folds pretty well too.  The front swivel wheel makes a huge difference with manuverability and the adjustable handle bar is a great feature. I am tall and it helps to have the handle where I need it.   I have used this for both walking, shopping and jogging and think it is perfect!  From purchase to delivery it took maybe 5 days.  I am extremely happy with all aspects of this purchase.  I love this stroller!

I bought this product to use during my camping trips. I had a minor issue with my order but was corrected immediately, great customer service. This is a really neat hammock, it packs really small but is very resistant. My friends loved it when they saw it and it was really easy to set up. You will enjoy it whether you go camping or on your backyard

Had this device for 3 months, absolutely love it! The chest strap you must wear in order to detect your heart rate takes a little time to adjust to, but it is very accurate. The most useful feature offered that is not included in many heart rate monitor devices on the market is being able to keep track of the distance you ran, the speed (max and average), and calories expended. This allows you to control your pace while running by speed, or because some days your body may react differently to exercise and may fluctuate; you can change your training accordingly with the heart rate monitor function. You are also able to easily program the watch so that it will alert you once you've reached a target heart rate, or time, or speed, and even resting rates, laps, etc., essentially letting you program your interval training. Distance is very accurate once calibrated manually. Never owned a gps based heart rate monitor before, but I chose this the gps based hrm because I need reliability (according to some reports on gps based hrm, the gps signal is weak when running in places with trees or tall buildings). Besides, if I get lost, I figure the extra running can't hurt me =

I really like the heart rate monitor and it works great.  As has been said, it takes some time learning all it does, but it's worth it in my opinion.  The only thing I was not real excited about was the pace jumps around quite a bit, but from what I have been told by others and their brands of running watches, they all do this to an extent.  Everything else I'm quite happy with and would highly recommend it to anyone. The distance reading has been right on the money after calibration.

If you are looking for complete information about the training or fitness activity and want to analyze to improve your performance or avoid overtraining this is the unit.
- Very nice software, a lot of nice information very well presented
- Speed sensor is reliable and accurate (does not suffer all kind of interfence such as GPS units) - error is really smaller than 5% even during long runs
- The information available during and after the exercise is great (temperature, altitude, calorie count, all HRM metrics such as average, maximum, %)
- Bike sensor provides speed, distance, etc
- Fitness test is a nice measure of improvemen

LOVE this knife.  Looks great, sharp as can be out of the box.  Thin enough for the pocket of my khakis.  One disclaimer, use the safety.  It opened up in my pocket once (no clue how) and could have been dangerous

Great little knife.  I've taken to carrying it with me on every occasion my Native is too big.  Super sharp and keeps its edge even after some pretty heavy use.  Only beef is that it's a little hard to open and close with one hand because of its size.  I'm going to have to get the leek

I purchased this knife for about $4 cheaper than its usual Amazon listing price at Amazon's Friday Sale.  I had been looking at the Kershaw knives for awhile, and following an incident in my building's parking garage (woman accosted, pocketbook stolen), it seemed like the perfect time to buy.  The "rainbow" titanium-coating color might bother some men, but I'm a woman, so I don't mind the color of the knife. I would have preferred the black-on-black, but this was too good a deal to pass up.

The safety lock looks like it might slip out of safety easily, but in two weeks time of regular wear/use, I haven't had a problem. I flip the knife open often (heck, it's fun), and I wear it regularly (what's the point of having it, if you're not prepared to use it?).  The thin attached metal "belt clip" is very sturdy and multipurpose (it looks similar to the metal clip on a writing pen). Not only can I clip the kninfe just inside my slacks waistband, but it clips easily to the inside leather pocket of my purse.  The single finger flip-open mechanism is beyond belief - very easy to use, exceptionally fast and accurate.  The locking mechanism (keeps the blade in place) is extremely solid, and has worked without flaw.  When I'm walking anyplace suspicious by myself, I hold the knife in the "ready to flip open" position in my hand, held down at my side.  The knife is nearly invisible in that position, so I don't stand out as "oh my God, she's carrying a knife!" However, someone intent on a criminal act just might notice, and avoid me altogether.  Great knife for personal safety.  Lastly, like the other reviews point out, these knives are SHARP. I don't use mine to open letters, boxes and typical pocket knife activities (I believe that would gum it up, and slow the opening speed of the knife), so I anticipate the blade should have a good, long life in my care.

We got this as a family gift for Christmas. We love the red color, and it's great to have out at most holidays. The kids were so excited to roll it around, and hear the ice inside. They didn't believe it at first that it was really making ice cream. The anticipation drove them crazy. But it was fun for everyone. I fully recommend this product. We are a family of 4 with the mega ball. At first I wasn't sure if it would be enough, but we even had leftovers. And I love the fact that it comes with recipes for different flavors. I would give it 10 stars if I could

We purchased the Mega ball and have made ice cream twice in 2 weeks. The kids think its great. It takes a good half hour or more, but worth it. Make sure you have a really good stiff plastic spatula for scraping the sides of the container, it can be hard to get off. Really easy to clean

Despite what the other reviewer has said, this table is great. I delpoyed to Iraq with this table folded up nicely in my duffle bag with no problems. The table is lightweight, and stirdy as long as you set it up correctly. I use it for my laptop indoors, but outdoors it works great as well (provided a hurricane isn't trying to blow it around) Overall, it's a great table that's compact and easy to set up and break down. My only complaint is that the plastic tabletop slats are thin plastic and if you have any heavy items sitting in the middle of the table it will bow a little unless you place the items directly on top of the support beams. I'd buy another if I had the need for one, and everyone in Iraq has complimented me on it because they're stuck trying to find ironing boards or water boxes to set their laptops on.

I work out at home using dumbells and a number of bodyweight exercises.  My dumbbell collection had grown cumbersome and messy, so I looked around for a way to organize these dumbells in my room, and this rack was perfect.  I did look at a number of racks both online and in RL, but the majority were way over my budget, had crippling shipping charges or were too limited in terms of their capacity to space ratio.  I was just about ready to fabricate my own when I found this on Amazon. After reading the reviews and crunching the numbers, I decided to give this a shot.  I'm happy to report this has completely solved my dumbbell storage problems. 
***
This rack arrived a couple of days before anticipated; with the use of a single crescent wrench, I put it together without assistance in the space of an hour or so.  Well within 2 hours of opening the box, it was in place and holding weights. It is solidly made of heavy gauge steel and quality welds covered in a tough tactile coating material.  The construction method is of simple carriage bolt and nylon insert locknut assembly. It ships with rubber coverings for the feet and all orifices.
***
The actual dimensions of this rack are 36.75" x 24" x 32" (W x D x H).  Add at least a foot to the height for the minimum workable usage space (for lifting the weights in and out).  I have filled it's available space with sets of 10-50# dumbbells in 5# increments.  For the past month, it has held 540# and remained absolutely rock solid.  From the feel of the thing, it could hold easily twice this weight without issue.
***
Highly recommended for personal use or even tight boutique space.

My wife and I love this product.  Now, it's not for backpacking, but it does work great as a car camping or base camp stove.  It does require one of those disposable propane tanks (which can be tough to dispose of), and it might make sense to get the carrying case (not seeing it attached here).  But besides that, a great, simple stove which can be used in all kinds of conditions

We bought this for my daughter when she was around 2 months old and she has loved it ever since.  We just moved her to a big girl bed because we have another one on the way, and she just wouldn't part with it.  My husband attached it to her bed and she still uses it to soothe herself back to sleep at night. (Almost 22 months old).

I was so disappointed to see that Fisher Price doesn't make this item anymore and had hope to find another new or used one for the new baby, but the prices people are asking here are outrageous

We purchased 4 sets of fins and masks for a trip to Jamaica. We were very happy with the US Divers product. The price was right and the fins worked just as expected. They worked just as good as sets we have rented. Rather than renting fins at the beach, we now have sets to use the next time we travel to the ocean

I bought this for when I work on my car/motorcycle in my apartment building's parking lot. The lighting is poor, and I've found headlamps to be an absolute necessity.

I bought this one because it seemed to have the properties I was looking for- a wide, even swath of light for close-in handy work. After comparing to several other lights on a site that is easily findable by searching for "flashlight reviews", I decided on this one.

Having bought it, I actually wish I had gone for the Princeton Tec Quad. The thing is- this headlamp is extremely bright. It has two buttons to select the light output- one chooses between using all 8 LED's, 5, 3 or just 1. The other chooses between full output, "dimmed" output, and a flashing mode. Even with 5 LED's on the dimmed output, there is plenty of light for me to see what I'm doing. 

The reason I say it's *too* bright is that with 3 AA batteries, it's kind of heavy. Basically, I wish I had went for the Quad, which has 4 LED's and traded off the excess light output for something lighter and more comfortable

I just read the other reviewer's comments.  Yes, the bag isn't huge, but it certainly gets the job done.  It's not the over-sized bag where you can stuff 6 full sized textbooks, but it's a bag that has style.  That's why I got it.  It's a bit more european in its design, and is of good quality.  I dont expect zippers to break anytime soon.  Look to be good quality.  Also, at this price--it is such a good deal

I used this for paintball on my military simulation A-5. I see other sights and I was worry about this since its cheaper. The red and green dot is MUCH more visible then my brother in law more expensive BSA also. 
About the manufacture website, it is a 40mm. Dont know why they said 30mm. But like some sight, the lens (both front and back) are both 40mm but theres a inner tube that control the up/down/left/right of the laser and it decrease the viewable area just slightly. Overall, it worked great. I can tease/tuant my teammates with pinpoint shots near them.

Estos son los guantes que mas me gustan para nadar. Mucho mejores que los aqua sphere. El asunto es que duran poco. Despues de unas 50 idas a nadar, ya estan muy rotos y hay que conseguirse otros. Tambien hay que tener cuidado con el tamao. Yo tengo manos grandes y solo me sirven bien el tamao medium. Por el resto el producto es muy bueno, y comodo.

I'm serious about acqua aerobics and the upper body workout I can get by using these high-resistance water gloves. The unique velcro closure is a great improvement over other types which were a struggle to get on and off. Wish they had a "Medium" choice of size. They only make a S and a L. These gloves were a great find and the price was right

This is my 4th pair of aqua fitness gloves, my 2nd pair of this exact Speedo Aqua Fitness Glove.  Allowing the fingers to protrude through the ends of the gloves is a great benefit.  With other gloves, water builds up inside the glove and, if lycra-backed for example, the glove becomes like a big balloon after a short while.

These Speedo gloves allow the water to pass through the glove and out the finger-holes.

In addition, the material the gloves are made of is much sturdier than other gloves I have had. The palms hold up well as do the backs.

I recommend these gloves and will always use them in my water fitness exercises

Overall this is a great little knife.  It opens fast, is very sharp and holds it's edge well and feels good in your hand.  The liner lock is great.  I have used some others and absolutely hated them because they were so hard to operate.  This one is smooth as silk and located in a great position.  Very nicely designed.

I did make a few changes which required going out and buying a torx screwdriver.  First,I reversed the pocket clip because it came the facing the opposite direction I was used to on my Spyderco knives.  Second, the safety had to go.  I found it slipped to the "on" position on its own so the knife did not open when you expected it to and was hard to disengage quickly.  Not because it was difficult to operate, rather it is tiny and hard to find blind.  If you like the safety though, it definitely does  prevent the blade from opening accidentally.

Speaking of safety...the knife arrives razor sharp.  I opened my package and promptly sliced a finger badly enough to leave a scar.  The tension that the blade is under requires some force to overcome and gives it a different feel when closing the knife from a regular lockback.  Be sure you fingers are nowhere near the blade.  I am now in the habit of disengaging the lock and closing by pressing the back of the blade against my thigh

This gun is pretty good but im not sure about the power being 300 fps and the battery takes too long to charge.  Although the clip only holds 30 rounds, the gun is deadly accurate and very powerful when charged long enough.  But please do not buy this gun for use as a sniper because the scope is a piece of s---.  I recommend blowing it up.  Anyway to answer that person's question the cocking handle is just for looks.  Now back to my review.  The scope does not have red crosshairs as i've heard people say and the sights are much better although you should tighten the screws.  The foregrip on this gun is awesome as you can fold it up or down and is not too wobbly in the down position.  Overall this is a great gun and I would highly recommend it to any airsoft player and plus it's only $30

(Chair is way to small for him) I love it for myself because when I take my children to the beach it is very easy for me to carry along with all the other beach accessories!! I would recommend it for someone looking for a light weight chair that is easy to bring along places

When I used lighter, less dense mats they would sometimes bunch up or move around during flowing vinyasa practice.  If my toe caught the mat, the edge would flip over and require adjustment.  Also, they did not cushion very well.  In addition, lesser mats wore out quickly and had to be replaced.  When doing poses like the side-arm balance, my foot would slip off the end of the regular length mat and I would fall out of the pose.

With the extra-long manduka mat, none of these issues is a problem.  The mat is solid and dense, and stays put on the floor no matter what I do.  It cushions really well, but because it is so dense it is no problem to balance or move on the mat (not mushy).  I beat the daylights out of these mats and they still look great.  Durability is outstanding, and they show no signs of wearing out.  Ever.  The extra length allows me to move with confidence, knowing I won't run out of room or slip off the mat.  An additional benefit of the long mat is that it allows you to change your starting position on the mat somewhat, so that the small area worn by your feet is not the same every practice.  In other words, you can spread the wear over a larger area to make it last even longer.  The surface is plenty sticky for normal yoga, and if you do a hot yoga class or sweat a lot you will likely want to have a towel anyway.  No complaints about stickiness.

As for weight, it seems that if you are big enough to need an extra-long mat you are probably plenty strong enough to carry it around.  It ain't heavy, it's the best yoga mat I've ever seen.

I've had trouble over the years finding ear plugs that would make a consistent seal against sound.   I've tried various types, including the compressible foam, but nothing seems to work all the time.   I use ear plugs when riding my motorcycle, under my full face helmet.   These plugs work great and are very comfortable.   They're also very easy to remove (not so the compressed foam, if they're just a little too far in).  I've had no problems with the ends touching the inside of the helmet and have since bought several more, including some for my riding buddies to try.   My only complaint is that the included case doesn't hold up to repeated use - the "hinge" just doesn't last - but the plugs have held up nicely for a couple of months now.

i have to say that i LOVE this mat. the combo jute and rubber make it nearly impossible to slip. only thing is... the jute and rubber are rubbing up against one another and kind of crumbling and flaking off where i often place my feet causing bald spots on my mat. haha. weird, huh? so now you know. other than that the mat is visually very pleasing

I had concerns when I ordered this machine. Like the fact that I am so short. I didn't know if it would be designed for taller people. It worked fine for my height as well as my husbands height. (I am 5') I also had concerns because I have arthritis but I was able to do this without causing flare ups all the time and I am able to set goals and get a decent workout. I am able to adjust the machine to more difficult tensions so this is something that will last a very long time for me. The only drawback that I have found with this machine is that it hurts the toes a bit. Mine are starting to get use to it a bit. This machine is worth the money. I would highly recommend it to anyone especially those suffering with bone disease such as I am. It is a wonderful way to get healthier without compromising on pain

I purchased my Leki Nordic Walking Poles because I read somewhere that these poles would reduce stress on my hips and knees while walking.  That is totally true!  I have a congenital malformation in my right hip which prevents me from ever being able to run or jog as a means for exercise.  I do love to walk, but was hindered by the pain from my right hip.  By using the walking poles, I am able to walk quickly without any pain at all, even though I am actually using more muscle groups than I would if walking without the use of poles.  Walking alone, a person only uses about 50% of the large muscle groups.  Walking with LEKI Nordic Walking poles, one will use up to 90% of all the large muscle groups; this turns a simple 30 minute walk into a full-body workout without stress!!  I would not walk any other way now that I own my LEKI poles!

I own an older version of this net. It is about 10 years old and has been used once/week every summer.  It was used in a high level volleyball league, but it would be great for recreational use as well.  I paid $200 for the net and it is still like new.  I can't believe this is selling for $69.

I got a pair of these boots for Christmas and even though I'm not sure what all they can be used for, they are great!  The construction is top-notch, they're  easy to use, comfortable, etc.  I seen cheaper boots on the market, but when I'm buying a product to let me hang upside down a few feet above the concrete/tile floor in my house, I want the best product for the job.  ;

This is a better stroller than the other three (all for one child) strollers we have. Very maneuverable and adjustable. It turns on a dime and seats adjust up and down independently. Folds down very quickly. It's great that the kids can sit next to each other.

I bought it through the Target -Amazon store, which was cheaper than the same product through other vendors. Its very easy to assemble although you may want to play with the chain a bit to set up the desired tension (by shortening the chain to belt connection which can get chain grease on you a bit).
To me it was exactly as advertised, a long rowing machine that is not too quite but far less loud than expected and works well. I do not fold it away after use but its a nice feature if you want to move it to another part of the house and dont want to lug an 8 foot long device

We have used more expensive "professional" grade ergometers that would have cost at least three times as much and we are very pleased with how the Integrity compares for a home version.  Assembly and operation are easy, the equipment seems well built and the noisy breeze generated by the wind resistance wheel is very tolerable, allowing conversation or TV viewing with only moderate volume increases

Highly recommended!!!! My wife uses this pack for nursing school.  As you can imagine she carries A LOT OF "STUFF".  This pack makes it a lot lighter on the shoulders than a normal pack would because of the padding in the straps.  I would recommend this to anyone who is a student and is looking for a durable pack for school

Pros: 
1.great compartmentalization everything is easy to obtain (if you know where to put it). 
2.Lots of room able to put just about everything in it. gym clothes, several text books, laptop, camping gear, etc. 

Cons: 
1.its bulky, even when nothing is in it, its bulky. if your one who likes to show off your back or want a sense of style this is not the product for you. Tip: to make less bulky, put more stuff in bigger compartments relative to smaller compartment.

2. THe shoulder strap strain resistant doesn't quite work...i'm consider myself an average male, strain works in about 25lbs. if you want less strain i'd go for the Targus or Wenger brands.

Conclusion: if all you want is lots of space to put ur stuff w/o the style involved this product is for you

I love my Jansport Odyssey backpack. It has a lot of room and the straps are much more comfortable than any other backpack I have ever owned or tried.  I have a lot of very heavy books and this backpack can't be beaten for tranporting books.  A little more padding in the straps (or smaller textbooks)would make it perfect, but it is still better than anything I have seen out there.  I would highly recommend it to any high school or college student

 I thought the DVD was excellent from the standpoint of a person not having much experience in lifting or exercising.  It shows great technique and form.  I used to be a wrestler in the highly competitive state of Iowa so over the years I learned many of these pushup and workout techniques.  Pushups and dumbbells used to be my main source of lifting and staying in shape.   I found myself to be too advanced for the Power 10 workout  so the video seemed like common knowledge.  So for beginners and more advanced people looking for a great DVD focusing on developing proper form and technique this is an excellent DVD .  The DVD takes you through many different styles of pushups showing the proper form and setup.  It then does about a set of three of that style pushup to show you the routine in live workout motion.  With the DVD purchase I was hoping to find an exercise program, approximately 30-45 minutes long, that sets up a nice workout routine for people short on time.  I was hoping for a video that combines a variety of different pushups using the Perfect Pushup into a nice timed workout.  A workout that works my chest, back, arms, abs, and some cardio into a nice overall workout that is done in short time.    Something similar to a Tae Bo style video or other timed exercise videos.  The Power 10 Workout isn't that type of video.  It is more specifically a technique video that one can evntually combined into a workout of their own.  I recently wrote some emails to the Body Rev president suggesting the development of a video for more advanced people that provides a fast, effective workout routine that one could get at the gym, but can do at home in 30-45 minutes with their Perfect Pushup.  He seemed pretty impressed by the idea so hopefully BodyRev builds on this DVD like they have for their other products.

As a man with nearly flat feet, this product has saved my legs.  While the quality and durability of this orthotic are similar to others in its class, what seperates it that SOF SOLE's CUSTOMER SERVICE IS OUTSTANDING and THE WARRANTY holds true.  When they wear out within a year, simply send them back and you'll get a new pair.  You'll be purchasing several pair, feel great and wonder why you didn' do it sooner.  I've owned Sof Sole insoles for 7 years and I'll have them for 7 more.

GREAT alternative to sugar. The FDA clearly doesn't care if we become diabetic, so we have to care for ourselves. This is a good part of God's creation being used for its designed purpose. Plus, the company was quick to get it to me and it arrived as promised. Great experience. I will buy again

The fat Mouth clamp-ons were easy to install and withheld a 15 hour trip from Texas to Colorado and back again. They came off my luggage rack very quickly and when when we are ready to use it again, will be quickly put back on. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an attachment for ski rack to thier factory installed luggage rack.

This product isn't a miracle product, but it does do a few things: it supports your back, it is comfortable, it does make you sweat (mostly on your waistline) and therefore does make you lose some inches and also detoxes you a little bit.   It's not a bad product overall, but don't expect a miracle... you have to do the work for this product to help you at all.  I do use it any time I'm doing an aerobic workout to enhance overall affects

My daughter just entered 9th grade and joined the tennis team. I have played badminton for years and tennis is a fun sport and about the only sport I will do with her other than walking or biking. I bought her this racquet because I wanted something easy for her, not too heavy, and reliable. The salesperson at Dick's Sporting Goods recommeded this one and I am happy to say that it has been great! She has been able to hit the ball and with some practice I can see her becoming more confident. In fact, the other girls on her team are always asking if they can play with her racquet! I have been doing alot of reading and the racquet really does make a difference; one piece is better and this is a titanium racquet. This racquet has great shock absorption; I have rheumatoid arthritis and will not play with a racquet that is going to leave me in pain. I liked this racquet so much that I just bought a second one so my daughter and I can play with the same racquet. P.S....it comes in a nice case...and the Wilson US Open Tennis Balls are an excellent choice for a match

We have purchased 3 of these tricycles in the past 2 years for our grandsons; 1 was a gift, but the other 2 are kept at our home as I watch the boys daily. The boys, ages 20 months and 3 yrs, love to ride them with the streamers flying and the bell ringing. I love them because of the way they are built. The center of gravity is set very low to the ground, making spills and tip-overs a thing of the past. The rubber wheels have a better grip than the plastic wheels of other brands too. (I had purchased a small plastic trike and the way the wheels would just spin in place was very frustrating to the boys.) The old-fashioned fenders on the wheels help keep little fingers from getting hurt and the wide step in the back seems to be useful when getting on or off. All in all, a great trike

Ok so I read a horrific review but that sounds like a lemon of a stove. Our stove is great! We took it out for a trial run with 12 or so friends and what do know it performed flawlessly. The ignition was quick the cook temp was even and we had our coffee before many others using their Colemans. In fact several friends couldn't believe the heat this little guy produced. We love this little stove and will be using it for many years to come

I've been carrying and using these Swiss Army Spartans (or similar model) for about 35 years.  Bought my first in Germany and couldn't get along without it now.  Great quality and has just about everything you could want for daily use.  It's small enough and light enough that it's comfortable to carry.  Doesn't have all the useless "bell and whistles" that you'd probably only use if you were a 12 year-old Boy Scout.  Only problem (mine, not the knife's) is that I tend to lose one about every 6-7 years... so I bought 2 this time so as to have a replacement for the next time it grows legs and walks away.  Another great feature is the optional eyeglass screwdriver than can be purchased and fits neatly (via a threaded handle) into the corkscrew

Gotta say I LOVE this Step and even more so the DEAL: Not only do you get The Step, but you also get FOUR raising-blocks *AND* a Step-workout dvd -- All for under $50!!! I think that's a bargain compared to buying the pro-equipment (I think it was $70-80 for the pro Step and $40-50 for two raising blocks, plus $15 for a DVD... that's, like, $140-150!).

The Step *is* smaller than the Steps you're probably used to from the gym, BUT it's not *that* much smaller -- I would say it's about 25% shorter length-wise.  It's gotta be though, I mean it's an at-home Step so they're making it more storable.  I guess if you're a big person it might be a little frustrating at first, but I don't see how you couldn't adjust to it.  Then again, I'm 5'2 & petite so for me it's the perfect size! haha :P

The DVD is pretty good.  It's pretty simple, basic stepping though, so if you're an advanced stepper you'll probably get bored real fast.  However, it does get you to sweat a little, so it's not a complete waste.  If not for the stepping, though, keep it for the abs workout -- OMG it's AMAZING!! For only 10 minutes it really makes you want to commit stomach suicide. haha  Which is a good thing because the next day your tummy is sore but FLAT. :)  But really, it's a good DVD, especially for those lazy days that you know you need to workout but don't want to (at least not too hard). LOL

Buy this kit, it's a *great* deal and it'll get you in shape! :

*****
This is an upscale designer water bottle, top of the line, and so much fun. The designs Of Sigg's water bottles are gorgeous, from the plain, solid color bottles, to the ones with intricate designs. They are simply beautiful! I switched from regular plastic water bottles because of health concerns, thinking it would take more work to maintain. These do necessitate regular cleaning (I clean mine every day), but having something so beautiful to drink from makes the cleaning fun. Sort of like my rings, glasses, and watch, I now consider my Sigg personal water bottle a vital accessory, reminding me to drink more water, making a statement about my values, and expressing myself with a special design. Yes, all in a water bottle!

Sigg of Switzerland water bottles are very high quality, made of light aluminum on the outside, slightly insulated, and covered with a special powder coat on the inside that prevents any leaching whatsoever, unlike plastic and polycarbonate water bottles. They are light, durable, and perfect for any activity. Well water tastes spectacular in these bottles, just like from the tap.

Sigg bottles come with several different types of tops. I bought the screw top because I don't like sports tops, and I don't mind unscrewing the top when I want a drink. It is totally leakproof, which is important to me. The top is pretty and can be hooked onto a carabiner. I get comments on it all the time, "What's that? I love it!" The sports top version is ok; I just am not a fan, as I don't feel like I can get enough water from the little stream from the sports top. However, for convenience, you might prefer it. For children, there is a cap-type top. All are leak-proof. If you are ever unsatisfied with the top, you can buy a screw top separately to fit your Sigg bottle.

Sigg makes their personal water bottle in .6L and 1L in this style. I have both. I use the .6L for sports activities because they are smaller. When I won't have to carry the container, I like the larger bottle. Sigg also makes a smaller .3L bottle for children that is a perfect size for young people. You can buy Siggs in alternative sizes too, such as .75L, .4L (for kids), .6L, .5L. You can occasionally find this bottle in the 1.5L size, also. Search Amazon for the perfect size.

Pick a style and pattern you like, as this bottle is a personal accessory, and should reflect your style. The colors are vibrant and even prettier than they seem in the pictures on Amazon.

They are expensive, but they are so durable that you can plan on them lasting many years. I consider them both an accessory and an investment in my health, so they are well worth it value-wise for me.

Highly recommended.

LED headlights are getting better all the time. This little guy is a one Watt Luxeon LED with very good power regulation. Regulation means that the light gets the most from a set of batteries and keeps the light at a given brightness instead of dimming as the batteries weaken. The Princeton Tec EOS has three brightness settings and a flash mode. I actually find the flash mode to be too slow to be useful on the bike and it flashes at full power but these are minor nits. I'd also prefer if the light used AA instead of AAA cells. So I guess there are two things I don't like about this light.

But the positives far outweigh the negatives. The light is small and is supposed to be waterproof to one meter. (I don't ride under water so I haven't tested that feature!) It's easy to operate and the batteries are easy to change. The light pattern seems to be just right for my riding. I use this light on my helmet but it also comes with a handlebar mount. I run the light at the lowest power setting most of the time and that's fine for reading my bike computer or cue sheets. The middle setting is better for general riding, spotting road signs and potholes and things like that. At the highest setting, you get the brightest beam but of course that eats through the batteries quicker.

I'm pretty sure the circuit in this light was designed by Willie Hunt, a real guru in bike lighting circles. And yes, I'm enough of a nerd that I actually keep track of things like that. Anyhow, the Princeton Tec EOS is my latest favorite bike toy

We bought this bicycle for our son's 3rd birthday.  He LOVED the bright colors and the fact that it has somewhere for his horses to ride!  It has taken a little while for him to get used to the training wheels, but the bike stays steady while he is riding and doesn't threaten to tip.  We are very happy with this bicycle

This - along with a pogo stick and stilts - was my effort to get my kids offf the video games at least some of the time! I thought this might be too hard for the 6 year old, but he persisted and is getting better at it. The point is, it's so fun he keeps trying! The 13 yr old - and my 17 year old daughter are enjoying it too. There seems to be a trade-off between the stilts and the hit-a-way. Only the little guy can handle the pogo stick - go figure

   The suit itself is great, but the sizing is just way off.  I purchased 
   a large and an extra large for my kids; the large is actually too big
   for me, and the extra large is enormous.  It is almost as though they 
   are sized for men instead of youth.  Hopefully they'll grow into
   them . . .

Very useful stopwatch.  I like the mutiple functions. My use is for swim workouts.  This watch allows me to have three intervals going at once.   The print is a little smaller than it appears on the picture.  Not a real problem.  I am glad I bought this stopwatch over my other choice which could only time two lanes.

Despite having some trepidation after reading the reviews of owners who had unpleasant experiences with the SG4, I bought it and am glad that I did.  My experiences using the SG4 during play have been very positive, even though on occasion the weather conditions have been so bad that I could only get a signal for some of the holes.  The large screen allows the user to easily see each of the obstacles on a given hole and know the distance to them and the distance required to carry them.  The SG4 also provides a more detailed view of each obstacle as well as the distances to the front edge, center, and rear edge of each green.  For golfers who like to know the exact distance they hit each of their clubs, the "MARK" feature is marvelous.  Being able to have all of this valuable information available for 10 professionally measured courses and 5 personally measured courses is of significant value for golfers who play a number of different courses not only on a regular basis but also for courses being played for the first time.  The SG4 also has a memory card slot for being able to download more courses when that service is offered in the future. I think the the downloading procedures on the SKY GOLF web site are somewhat confusing but not very difficult to figure out and use with only a few minutes of effort.  I know several low and mid-handicappers who LOVE this device, and I share their enthusiasm and opinion -- I am a high handicapper.  I also own a Bushnell Pinseeker 1500 with slope and consider the SG4 to be a far superior "tool" to the Bushnell. NOTE: there is at least one additional cost that buyers will incur after they receive their Sky Caddie -- the subscriber fee for downloading courses for 1 year.  The fees range from $30 for courses measured in one state that you designate to $80 for worldwide use

Looks great, functions great.  Manual is a little daunting and a couple of the words on the display are very small.  I have 20/20 vision and I can't always read everything that is being displayed.  It is mostly in the Alt and Barometer functions where there is lots of info being shown.  

Highly recomended

For those who may be new to Suunto, they are wrist-top computers designed and manufactured in Finland and are in use all over the world by Hikers, Bikers and outdoor enthusiasts of all kinds.  What makes the X-Lander stand out are at first glance, obviously its sheer size.  Let there be NO illusions, the X-Lander is a mighty big watch.  Despite its size, it doesn't FEEL as big as it looks, though.  The aluminum case is VERY light and quite comfortable, too.  The next thing you notice would be the HUGE amount of bells and whistles packed into such a small device.

#1. An accurate altimeter.  This is an invaluable tool for the avid hiker and biker.  One thing you MUST be ready to do is remember to adjust it DAILY.  Find out what the altitude is and set the watch before you begin your trip, and then at the end of the day you need to make note of where you stopped (which you can do with the internal recording function) and properly adjust it before setting out the next day.  This is NOT a flaw, every single altimeter watch I am aware of is exactly the same.

#2. Barometer.  I found it correct at least 75% of the time, which is more than I can say for the local TV Weatherman.  This includes a thermometer as well, which in order to be accurate must be removed from your wrist for at least 15 minutes in order not to get a false reading due to lingering body heat.

#3. Digital Compass.  This is truly one amazing feature, by the way.  Once you calibrate it (which you may need to do weekly) you will NEVER be lost -- especially if you know how to use a map.

#4. It tells pretty accurate time, too believe it or not.  It also comes with an alarm, a countdown AND a stopwatch.  Suddenly its size now makes sense, huh?  

I happen to LIKE big watches.  I don't exactly know why, but I just do.  IF I were to have ANY complaint whatsoever, the one thing this watch is lacking is exactly what they have included in the much less expensive Vector: A tiny little bubble which helps you to level out the watch in the compass mode for a more precise reading.  The reason why may have to do with the fact that the X-Lander is mineral crystal and the Vector is plastic, but either way, it'd be nice to have.  I am VERY impressed with just about everything associated with Suunto and their fantastic line of what they call, Wristop Computers.  IF size really DOES matter to you, well you may wish to go with the Observer or maybe the X6HR (which does everything the X-Lander and Observer can do PLUS it has a built-in heart-rate-monitor) both are smaller than the X-Lander, Vector, Yachtsman and many other Suunto models yet still offers a LOT -- but keep in mind with the smaller size comes the bigger price.  Factor all that into your purchase plans and once again, if at ALL possible, do NOT buy until you have the chance to see some of these (or any) models IN PERSON.  That will make a HUGE difference in how happy your purchase will end up being...and good luck!

I recently got into gymnastics so I started looking for a leotard for someone with real curves. I'm 5'6'' and 180lbs and the XL fits me great. It has long sleeves which is great for the wintertime and I don't have to feel self consciousness about my fat hanging out there because it covers it up. It's cut low enough so that I'm not getting wedgies and I can do handstands without worrying if my workout shirt got un-tucked. It's not flashy so I don't look like a 10 year old in a fat 26 year olds body. It's nice and plain, gets the job done and I'm sure the others at they gym thank me for covering up for goodness sakes

I ordered this bike on Monday and it was delivered on Thursday! The pictures of this bike don't begin to do it justice. It has a solid metal tube construction and a big padded seat. I am 5'9" and this beauty adjusted perfectly. It is very stable and whisper quiet. I was a bit skeptical when I ordered it but what a bargain!!

I bought this bike for my boyfriend for Christmas. It arrived in about 3 days, rather than the expected 5-7. We set it up on about half an hour. It comes with a small wrench that is perfect for the set up--I read an other review (prehaps on a different bike) that you need a cresent wrench, however for this bike you don't.
He uses it every night, and I use it a few times a week. It's silent and nothing has broken on it as of yet...granted I've only had it for a month.
I would definitely recommend this product

I knew I wanted a bowflex and couldn't decide between the models available.  This model offers the most range in exercises and still has the ability to fold up small enough to be able to set up a double air mattress in my "spare/exercise" room for a weekend guest. 
This product came in several large boxes and is best assembled by a two person team (A husband/wife team worked for us). 
This is the first exercise equipment I have been consistent with.  It is fun to use and takes no effort to change between sets.  I also have the Ab attachment.  Love it

Working out used to be heh for me, but after getting the door gym I made a rule. Anytime I enter my bathroom (which is where it is suspended) either before or after I have to do 10 Pull-ups and 10 Neutral pull-ups, also since I purchased the broad-reach 10 of those as well. It's working wonders, within the first week of doing pull-ups where i'd use my legs just enough to complete the pull-up I'm now able to do 10 regular pull-ups. I'm very happy with this product, only downside (which I personally don't really care about) is that depending on what kind of door frame you have you could get some denting on the front side, the backside works just fine and leaves no marks on your walls. So anyway... I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a quick and depending on how hard you want to work :P easy workout

i got this gun for christmas, and i just got the m14 sniper from pyramyd air. this gun is a very good beginners gun, and a great backup in an airsoft war. im a sniper/backup man, and this is my backup, i am very happy with the performance of this gun.

pros-
has a decent rate of fire
electric so it doesnt have to be cocked for each shot
comes with 8000 bbs (great deal)
collapsible stock

cons-
small but manegeable magazine
accesories are sketchy,  laser broke 
t handle is very loose but helps stability
accuracy on semi auto is ok not good not bad 

if ur looking for a decent beginners gun, or backup like me, than i highly recommend this gu

I am so glad I finally found an online source for these visors.  I've been picking them up, one or two at a time, from street fairs for probably 20 years now.  You can see me wearing them in all my adult travel photos, because they are so light and comfortable, and they keep the sun out of your eyes (or the rain).  And these particular visors, here on Amazon, had good snaps, too

After reading the horror stories of the assembly process/instructions I was a little worried.
Myself and my 12 yr old daughter put it together in about 3 hrs without issue. All parts were included, instructions were clear, she did the step check off's 
The base took 400lbs of sand vs the 375lbs stated in the instruction

After reading the previous reviews and noticed the bad comments about the instructions, I took that into considerations and purchased it anyways.
Nobody was really talkin bad about the board.

Most of us have the urgency of putting it together w/out reading the instructions and simply just looking at the drawings. You have to approach this one differently.

I went ahead and borrowed a friend of mine and paid him with cold beverages because I defintely agree that you need at least 2 people to put this together.

The Instructions although not as detailed did mention that you MUST READ THE ENTIRE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY to assemble this item, failure to do so can delay your assembly because you have to disassemble and re-assemble again.

Finally, it took us 4 1/2 hrs to complete the assembly and based on my experience, it wasn't that bad at all. I only wish they added spare washers/nuts just in case you lose it.

Once its installed, I added water to it and let me tell you. Its supposed to be portable but w/ the base filled, its pretty heavy.

The board has a better rebound than other cheap boards out there but its not like the ones at the indoor gym. 50" is adequate for a home use, but you better have the apace for this. The base takes alot of room.

The ability to move the height up/down is as advertised. I can do it with one hand. Very nice!!!
I measured it from the rim to the floor and its accurate based on the height you adjusted to.

One thing I found out just now. This "slam-it" rim, you are not allowed to hang on it or it will cause you your warranty. I know because Lifetime answered my question I emailed out.
They do not have weight limits on these rims so do not attempt to hang on it. 

I defenitely recommend this if your shopping for one.

I really like this mat by Hugger Mugger. The thickness is really nice especially if practicing on hardwood or tile floor. I actually purchased mine at TJ Maxx for $10 buck less than the selling price here. The color selection is very nice too. My one complaint is that I had to wash it several times to rid the mat of a chemical odor. I recommend using an organic soap or spray whenever washing a yoga mat. This one in my experience, needs to be washed & completely dried several times for it to have a fresh scent. All in all I say this is a fine product. However, the very best mat imho are Ecomats which are made from jute plant. Much more expensive than this one but well worth the price

Although my wife disagreed - I bought this for my son's 6 year old birthday.  It took him a day to figure it out well enough to jump on it from a stand still and get going a hundred yards or so.  

Materials look reasonably good, it's light enough that he can cary it, and stout enough that I (dad) can also enjoy a fun ride.  I must say this is one of the coolest toys invented.  Easily 5 stars

I'm 26 and I'm having a blast on this board! It's much more accessible than snowboarding and surfing, because you can just grab your board and go!

I take mine to a local tennis court for the smooth surface. They recommend using small hills and stuff, but honestly stopping or slowing down is pretty much impossible on a decent incline, so I prefer to stay on flat land. Its amazing how long you can stay on the board without even setting a foot on the ground! The board seems to be constructed fairly well. I've gotten to the point where I can some pretty advanced turns by shifting my weight effectively, its really fun trying to master it. 

I'm curious if the Ripstik (competitor board) is better constructed since its made by Razor, and they might have put more money into the design. Anyways, I've had mine for about 2 months, and the wheels are definately showing a lot of wear. I'll most likely have to replace them soon. I'm kinda happy that you can use any rollerblade wheels instead of some proprietary wheels. That enables you to look for good deals on some wheels. 

I'd also look around for the best deals on these boards. I got mine at a Sports Authority on sale for $80, after having seen one at an FAO on my visit to Las Vegas for $130.

So, if you're a fun-loving adult who likes cool new ways of moving along,  I'd definately recommend this! It's addicting

Love this backpack, it's been with me to numerous cities and countries and survives the trips very well, while protecting the contents well, laptop included.  The outside large pocket is larger than you think when you realize just how much stuff you can fit in there, and still fit under an airplane seat.  Love the two water holders on the outside. Love the zippers are a loop so you can attach a carabiner, compass, or whatever. The support is great, you'll barely feel its there, and if you do, just use both straps, and then strap the front for great support. The pen storage area could be larger to accommodate larger pens, but thats quite minor.

My only con is that the outside two pockets have gotten stuck twice already. I am now on my third backpack(gotta LOVE REI's return policy). Hopefully this one will last as I have yet to find a better more complete backpack.  
Update 1/30/2007 - Third backpack , third zipper to get caught, time to return, again. I wish I could change the scale down to 2 stars :

For the price and relative ease of use, this is a decent starter net.  The five foot height/width makes it a little small for older youth.  It is easy to fold, carry and store, which is a huge plus - especially compared to other so-called portable nets.  It deploys fairly easily enough, though the support pole set-up is not completely intuitive.  The set I puchased had no instructions, so it wasn't until after several uses that I completely figured it out. All in all, however, I am pleased with it and would buy another should the need arise

I am very happy with my choice. It is just the right size, nicely finished with glossy black paint, installs in a minute. Usage is very convenient: it has that perfect click-into-place property: you push down on it with your forefoot and it snaps into the "stand" position. To "hide" it when you are ready to go, just hit back with your heel or simply start pedalling and it snaps back along the frame. It does the job perfectly and it feels great

I've never been a fan of propane stoves. They always seemed flimsy, made for those toy-sized backpacking pots and pans and potentially dangerous - until now. After two weeks of RV-ing, the Fold 'N Go has become a welcome addition to our set up. 

It is very sturdy and seems extremely well made. The wide separation of the two burners and heavy-duty pot supports allow for two large, heavy fry pans and/or stock pots at one time. Few stoves of any kind can handle simultaneous large pots. And it seems very stable when set on a table.

And because it folds in half and becomes its own carry-case, even though it handles such large tasks, it's easy to carry and takes up very little storage space. It also has an instant start feature - you just turn the nob and then press a button and that's it. You're ready to cook. 

And after you're done, clean up is a snap. Unlike other stoves where you have to take them all apart to try and get at that nasty, spattered grease, this one is pretty much all sealed - just take the pot supports off, wipe off underneath, flip the pot supports over to store inside and then Fold 'N Go!

It's great to get cooking moved outside the RV - especially for things like frying bacon or cooking anything that gives off a lot of steam. And because our meals seem to entail usually one or the other, we plan on getting an extension hose off our main propane tank to run this frequently in the future.

I was spending the day at home with a cold.  The doorbell rang.  At my doorstep, was a large box.

"Already? I just ordered it a few days ago." 

I shrugged on a jumper and hauled the surprisingly light (it's only 52 pounds) box up the stairs.  A sharp knife, a pair of nail clippers, thirty minutes and several small drifts of white packing material snow later, I had my Extreme Pilates put together.

On first impressions, the mat graphic is cheesy, and the frame looks flimsy.  However, this isn't just a Pilates trap table:  the leg spring hooks are placed further back than they are on studio quality equipment, and are less likely to get in the user's way.  The push through bar won't drop if you let go of it, because the metal is engineered not to slide.  There are warning stickers to use the safety strap on the push through bar. Overall, this is a safer machine than the original.

When you try to use it, though, there are a few problems:  I'm 5'4" and the mat is too short if you want to roll down to the floor.  The springs are light, and I would suspect that replacing them with heavier ones might overload the strength of the frame.  It's not clear which springs are the leg springs.  The lack of clips is just silly.

That said, I can do everything I can do on a trap table.  I did the cat, swan and saw with the push through bar, leg circles with the springs, chest expansion and roll down with the bar, and even the magician's series to finish.  

That kink in my shoulder that only goes away with the push through bar started to work itself out.  I could hear the springs (real springs, not bungee cords!)  All was (briefly) right with the world.  This is an amazing piece of equipment for the price.
 
Three caveats:  Not for taller men; it's just too small.  Not for serious athletes; not enough resistance.  Not for people with children if you can't lock it away; springs are not safe for the little ones to play with.

I have had many backpacks for school and am always left wanting more space.  I like to have different places to put different materials.  This gives me the opportunity to do so.  I like the fact that I can put my Ipod in a section that is not likely to recieve the weight of the many books I use.  I would say that the area where you hold the smaller items, such as pens and calculators, is nice.  You have dividers where you can hold many different things.  Overall, this is the best pack for school I have come across

I love my Jansport Odyssey backpack. It has a lot of room and the straps are much more comfortable than any other backpack I have ever owned or tried.  I have a lot of very heavy books and this backpack can't be beaten for tranporting books.  A little more padding in the straps (or smaller textbooks)would make it perfect, but it is still better than anything I have seen out there.  I would highly recommend it to any high school or college student

My kids got these from Grandpa.  They love them!  They're fun to bowl with in a dark room.  We've clipped them onto headboards for a decent-sized reading light.

The problems: The clip is pretty hard to operate, even for an adult.  Also, the plastic base broke on each of our lights (in different places), so now they're clip-less.  They're still well-loved and well-used by the little guys, though.  

I recommend these lights, but be careful w/ the bases

With the birth of our first child, there were tons of little toys lying around all the time, from teethers to rattles, stuffed lovies and blocks.  The traditional toy box was too bulky for our small living space, so when someone gave us this adorable tote we were thrilled to see how much fit inside, how sturdy it was, and how much our baby loved looking at it!   With bold primary colors and cute scenes surrounding the entire bin, there is even a fold out flap with a play space, and a singing bird which attaches to the side basket.  The fun roof is all made of satin ribbons that resemble "shingles."  This was easily stored in our closet or taken along on trips.   Best of all, there seems to be no end to how much you can stuff inside!  It is soft and collapsible, yet stands upright and will hold just about all your small baby toys.  It can be VERY GENTLY machine washed, but we discovered it was best not to throw it in with anything heavy.  I gave one to a neighbor when her son was born and she still raves about how perfect it was for their baby's toys.  I give this 5 stars without hesitation; affordable and totally functional

We have had the 438 for over a year and it has been outstanding.  I started using an elliptical at the gym and still do but the convenience of having this at home is perfect.  Construction is top notch and the workout is oh so quiet.

The workout monitor keeps track of every workout by user and has such features as fitness test, recovery and many workout profiles to keep you  challenged.

What started out as a purchase for my use is now also used by my wife and daughter.  I guess they had to try it after I continued to rave about it.

Time flies while you are on the 438.  Best of all this unit actually gets used.

If you are going to buy one piece of home exercise equipment... look no further.

I've owned three pairs of these so far, and they're easily the best gloves I've ever used.  I had previously only used unpadded gloves, and the padding in the palm seemed a little thick at first.  The padding does make it more difficult to get a solid grip in some exercise machines that also have large rubber grips on them (lat pulldown bars, for example), but that's the trade off for excellent support and protection when using the gloves on machines with uncovered metal grips.  

I found these gloves to be more durable than the other non-padded Harbinger gloves I've worn.  The gloves can be safely washed and air dryed, as advertised.

My only complaint with regard to wear is that the unreinforced leather where my thumb meets the padding in the palm seems to wear out before the rest of the glove.  Every pair I have owned will eventually wear a hole in this particular area.

Quick shipping - I received this bike in 4 days (using free super saver shipping) and it was even over a holiday!  The bike comes in one large box with MANY pieces.  My husband and father put the bike together in less than 1 hour.  It looked a little overwhelming at first but was quite easy to assemble.  The bike is very compact and easily placed in small areas.  It is also very quiet - you have to listen closely to even hear the bike.

The resistance goes from 1 to 8 (one being the easiest to eight being the hardest).  My husband is an avid road biker and 8 could be too easy for someone looking for a really hard ride (like riding the equivalent of up-hill).

The bike offers basic functions that are displayed very large.  The display is easily toggled through.  The heart rate monitor picks up okay, but don't buy the bike based off of that function because it's not totally reliable.

All in all, a great buy!  I injured my back and was looking for a workout that would be good on my back.  The seat is uncomfortable (and I am petite- I would imagine it would be very uncomfortable if someone was larger.  But for the price, you can't beat it

Perfect, exactly what I expected and wanted. I ride to work in rain or shine or storm and was sick of the water shooting up, had it on in less then 5 min. My bike is full suspension, 26 inch wheels with that horse shoe (U) bar on the lower legs of the front fork and it still fit with no problem. Don't know how it would handle a crash in trees though, sits high like a dirt bike look. People ask where I got it

The science is sound, but check it out yourself.  

Police, military, etc., are using it, Fortune 100, other governmental agencies.  Schools should use it, if they don't.  It puts the kids into their best possible learning state.

Seriously, 5 stars is not justice.  50,000 stars.  50,000 is the number of neurons directing your brain when you are in the zone.  The power the brain when "coherent" or not is tangible, and it's driven by the heart.  

You can sense it in a person, anger, happiness, whatever.  It's the healing state.  It's the creative state.  It's where hormones balance.

Compass worked wonderfully for my trip around New England this summer. Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is for want of a backlight for night driving. Remember to moisten the suction cups before adhering to the window. I forgot the first time and it popped off 10 minutes later. Never came off again the whole trip after I moistened them.  Worth the money.

This gun is awesome! It shoots hard and fast. The battery pack was a little hard to get on at first, but it works.  Don't fire them in the house.  They put dents in the doors and blinds [they shoot really hard].  They bounce off the basement walls and really hurt, so go outside.  

I did a battle with my dad and brother, and it lasted 2 hours.  It was great!  Now my dad wants one of his own

Sometimes this unit works flawlessly, other times it seems to have trouble picking up the signal.  I am not sure if that is a problem with this USB device, the Polar HRM, or the way that I am holding it.  In any event, most of the time it works and the data transfers quickly.

This is one of the BEST weightlifting gloves that I have found so far!!  I like it so much, that I've bought a few pairs.  These have very supportive wrist wraps that are adjustable to secure your wrist during lifting - to help prevent injury.  The rest of the glove is terrific.  It is thicker around the palm and fingers, so it provides EXCELLENT cushioning for those heavy lifts. I have not had  one blister, or redness since I've started using these gloves, and I've been using them for over a year now.  They are extremely comfortable. After a year of use, my gloves are still in perfect condition too.  I've tried other brands, and the others tend to have thinner material around the palm and fingers,  and this causes redness and blisters, so what's the use of using them?  On the other hand, this Valeo Ocelot Wrist Wrap Weightlifting glove is perfect in every way!!  Has support, comfort, and it looks great. I have the orange pair (GLOW), and I get lots of compliments at the gym too about how great they look. Well worth every penny.  Way to go Valeo!

I have used this product now as a self supported bicycle rider for two years.  I am pleased with the product.  It's not real soft and fluffy like a thick towel but does a great job in absorbing water after a shower or stream bath and dries fast.  It's as practical as can be for what I got it for!  It also is very compact and light in the pack.  The one piece of advice I have is to not get a smaller version but go with the larger size.  The additional weight and bulk in nothing and having the additional towel surface is worth it

My wife and I put this thing together in about an hour.  There was one cracked foot tread, but after calling Schwinn, we had a replacement within two days and no hassles.  If you are looking for a decent machine at a great price, this is a nice one.  It is fairly sturdy and has some nice preprogrammed workouts

We had in mind the type of exercise bikes we wanted.  We investigated several brands, models, and vendors.  The Schwinn 212 appeared to be the best value.  And, given the free shipping, Amazon had the best price.  So we ordered.  We were not in any way dissappointed.  Assembly was reasonably easy.  And the bikes are working out well for us

The Schwinn Airdyne is built to last out of steel. For upper and lower body workout, it uses a fan/flywheel to create resistance rather than a friction belt or magnetic motor; hint--fewer repairs and failures since there is no friction mechanism to fail.

The onboard computer allows your to select what information you wish to see such as mets, calories, distance, speed, rpm and even displays your pulse if you wear a chest strap.  You can select miles or kilometers for distance and "club or home" for setup; hint--built to withstand use in a fitness center/health club. It even allows you to imput your geological elevation to facilitate a more accurate calorie count.

Assembly is straight foward but does require a few basic tools such an adjustable wrench and phillips screwdriver.

This represents a good way to go if you want a well built durable piece of equipment intended for serious use to achieve your goal of cardio-vascular conditioning, weight loss or just plain old exercise

I like this knife very much; it's size, shape, fit in the hand, and pocket clip are all just what I wanted. It has a nice edge and the Speed Safe assisted opening feature is fantastic. My only complaint is that the safety is placed in such a way that makes one-handed opening difficult with the safety engaged. I want the safety engaged because the assisted opening is so easy to activate and I don't want the knife springing open in my pocket. This is only a minor quibble, though. I do enjoy the knife very much; it is a good size to wear with jeans for light duty day-to-day use, which is what most people need a pocket knife for anyway. I use a different, larger knife for heavier duty use

I own several LED flashlights including 3 different ones from C Crane Company. This little unit from Garrity outshines them all.
It is a bright far reaching light and the long battery life is impressive all in a light that fits in the palm of your hand.

If you need just one handy convinient flashlight to carry with you, throw that old 3 cell mag light in the trash and welcome to the new age of flashlights

We have a slightly sloped yard so I was hesitant about getting a trampoline.  We tried it, and it works fine!  My kids love it!  Of course, like any other toy, they take it in spells but it still gets used alot after 6 months.  I was also concerned at first about them falling off of it.  I almost bought the enclosure to go with it but I decided to wait and see how high they jumped, etc.  This trampoline is so small, they really can't get a lot of "air" so they don't do flips and other dangerous tricks.  It's also very low to the ground.  I am glad now that I didn't get the enclosure.  We don't really need it.  I would recommend this trampoline for younger kids.  The weight limit is 120 lbs so it can't support larger kids.  Also, since it is so small, we only let our two preschoolers jump together.  When we have guests over, it's one at a time.  I love it that my kids want to be outside so much.  This is better money spent than on video games, in my opinion

MFG by Northpole LTD, this roomy chair features padded seat and back for additional comfort.  Seating position is leaned back, lacking adjustment for more upright seating.   Fabric appears to be a durable rip stop nylon.  The arms are padded with foam, and I question foam durability over the long haul.  The chair could benefit from the addition of a cup holder.  Chair is rated at 225 pounds, and is close to 4 feet in length when folded and in its carry bag.  NFL team logo is embroidered on front and back of seat back and looks sharp.  Team name and logo is also printed on carry bag.  Overall, a comfortable, well constructed chair (with exceptions as noted) with an eye catching logo of your favorite team

The display didn't work on the first rower we got, and one of the wheels on the front of it was broken.  Amazon sent out a new one the day I reported the problem, and helped me get UPS to pick up the damaged one.  The second rower arrived in good shape, and works fine.  The different programs are nice, it's extremely quiet, and my wife likes it better than the air rower we use at the Y.  The slightly padded seat is also a bonus.  One of the most important features for us was the heart rate monitor.  It comes with the chest strap, and displays heart rate on the LCD screen so you can vary your workout to stay in the target zone.  The heart rate monitor is not available on inexpensive rowers, and with some of the more expensive ones, you still have to buy the chest transducer separately.  Overall, quite satisfied with the rower, and because of their excellent customer service, extrememly satisfied with Amazon

Overall this is a very good rowing machine - quiet, takes up a small amount of space, and easy to use. My only complaint would be the LCD - the first order sent to me had a damaged computer, but Amazon was quick to send out a replacement rower which took care of the problem. Now every thing is great

We were having trouble deciding between this rower and the Kettler Coach.  This one was available thru Amazon, but the Kettler had to be purchased thru Merchantila, which has a horrible reputation.  So, we went with this model.

I couldn't be more pleased.  Where it was manufactured was not listed, so I contacted Lifecore.  I had a response within 24 hrs.  Made in Taiwan, but don't let that put you off.  This is NOT a China quality product.  It's VERY sturdy.  Smooth and silent.  The preset programs vary not only in intensity, but time.  Some are 10 minutes.  Some half an hour.  Haven't tried them all.  Four programs are for you to set.

Ordered it on a Monday.  Here by Friday.  My husband had it set up before I got home from work.  He did complain that the instructions weren't well written.  But he never complained about actually putting it together.  Must not have been too difficult.  All tools were included.

You can also set your workout by time, distance, calories and strokes.

While checking Merchantila's BBB rating, I also checked Lifecore's.  They have NO complaints.  That also helped us decide.

I love this machine.  I'm sorry I didn't get a rower sooner

The Bowflex is one of the most amazing machines I have ever used.  With its range of exercises and a little creativity on your part, you can do just about any exercise you want to do.  I completely recommend this if you don't have the time to go to the gym or if you just really enjoy working out at home.  

One disclaimer, don't think you can get the same results you can get from free weights.  If you are an avid free-weight lifter, you can get your kicks out of maxing the leg press and perhaps even maxing the bench.  The PowerRods have a tension that is proportional to the amount of bend you give them.  Thus, if you do an exercise with 100 pounds of resistance, but only move the power rods through their first half of bend, you aren't getting 100 pounds of resistance.  Also, when you extend the arms of the pulleys to do the wide grip bench, you decrease the amount of bend in the rods to the point where, even if you bend them all the way, you aren't getting full resistance.  

Don't get me wrong, I love this thing; I've had mine for the past 2 years and it is amazing.  I work out twice a day for about 45 minutes to an hour each session, only because I don't have the time to make it to the gym.  Get this if you are very serious about workout out at home and don't have a lot of space to fit other equipment.  Make sure you have a positive attitude going into the lifting programs.  Experiment with ideas on different exercise movements.  More than anything, this piece of equipment is a blast to use, have fun with it

I'm a small person, not a bodybuilder and hated free weights.  However, I realized as I got older that I really needed to do some type of strength training.  I'd been thinking about a Bowflex and after looking at the literature, decided I wanted an Ultimate.  I purchased a used one and don't recommend that route since the seller lost some of the parts and delivered a damaged machine (long story).  I was able to order the missing pieces from Bowflex, but it took forever to get them.  Once I was able to use the machine, I absolutely loved it.  It's especially good for me since I'm usually alone when I work out and was concerned about injury with free weights or other types of exercise/weight machines.  Additionally, due to a neurological problem, I had little extensor function in one hand.  Using the Bowflex, I've been able to rebuild some of the muscle tone and would highly recommend this for anyone who needs physical therapy requiring weights.  I use this faithfully every day, alternating between arm exercises and shoulder exercises.  It's a pleasure to use and not at all tedious.  I think I probably could have done with one model under this since I never use the leg equipment.  Nevertheless, I'd recommend buying this item new from the manufacturer.  It's pricey, but well worth the money

I had one of these years ago and just recently purchased a new one I can say without hesitation that the product really works.  Its great for martial artists, particularly those whose arts rely on grabs, chokes, and need strength in the hands.

These are also good for anyone needing general purpose finger strength, I havn't used one in ages but my friends still say I have some of the strongest hands they've seen and I attribute this entirely to the use of the eagle catcher

I've had my 1 quart Stanley Thermos for over 20 years now, and this is by far, no doubt about it, the best thermos ever invented. I have poured hot coffee in this thermos in the morning prior to doing field work in the dead of winter in upstate NY.  After leaving the thermos literally sitting in the snow in -20 degree temperatures all day, at 5 pm the coffee was still piping hot.

If you need to keep liquids hot, this is the best non-electric product out there for doing it

This very comfortable strap can be put around your wrist or ankle and when you do the exercise, you can just concentrate on the muscle you're working and not have to worry about the theraband slipping.  It's terrific

I bought this on somewhat of a whim because I've been wanting get a little more in shape (got a little bit of pudge going on) and I realized the hardest part of motivating myself to work out was actually getting ready and going out to the gym.. time was somewhat of a factor as well.  So I ordered this a few days ago because I read some reviews on here and it looked like the price was right.  Set it up earlier today; The quality of the parts is basically no worse or better than I'd expected.. think of it as a stripped down eliptical machine.  Setting it up was fairly easy but some of the instructions were a bit unclear.  Threw on some running sneakers and got on, and I've got to say, the feel/motion of this thing is REALLY strange at first.  Unless you are a ballet dancer or gymnist with really good balance, be prepared to look like an idiot on this thing for a little while because, like it's name, it is completely freestyle.  It's range of motion and rhythm is ALL up to you.  Have you ever been on a ski lift at a mountain and had the urge to swing your skis forward and back in unison just because it gives you that tiny feeling of being thrown off balance?  You might start unintentionally doing that for a few minutes on this thing (it's actually kind of fun but of course, there's not much of a workout factor doing it).  After about 10 minutes, I started to get the motion down.  It was pretty fun once i got the hang of it, but I agree with other reviews, it does make your feet sore... might try putting some foam on the footplates

Just 3 weeks ago, I came here looking at reviews for the Tony Little's Gazelle Freestyle, and read mixed reviews.  However, most were encouraging, and I thought it sounded like the thing for me.  I have now used the gazelle for less than 2 weeks, and have already seen results!

This is no lie -- I lost 2 inches in the waist, 2 in the hips, 2 in the abdomin, and 2 in the thighs.  I'm just as freaked as you may be, but I'm telling you, this is the honest truth!

I was discouraged that I had not been seeing any results on the scales lately, and needed to change things up, so I'd see something move again.  This gazelle did it for me.  At this time, I'm only up to 30 minutes a day, and 1-3/4 miles... I'm still a work in progress. But these results are no lie.  Just think how much results I'll see when I can stay on longer!  They advertise it as a low impact overall machine, and it truly is.  I have Rheumatoid Arthritis, and Fibromyalgia, so I was looking for something I could do that wouldn't hurt me.  I can honestly say I get a full workout on this machine... oh, I forgot to mention, also 1 inch in the arms.  So, that's a total of 9 inches in 2 weeks.

This is the best machine I've ever used, (we also have an exercise bike, and ab lounge, which I've not used in the last 2 weeks at all, cause I was getting such a good workout on the gazelle) and I'm so happy I found it.  And I thank you people, users of Amazon.com, for coming here and posting your reviews, and making it easy on me to know which machine to buy. Mine is the exact picture above, and folds up.  I also love that feature.  It's not a problem to just fold it up and lean it against the wall beside my bed after each use. Therefore, I've still got lots of walking space beside my bed.

I was a little skeptical about the Gazelle at first because it didn't look like you could get a work out from using it - but I was wrong!  But let's start at the beginning: 

It's pretty easy to set up - the directions on the dvd were great and I could do it all myself. I was really excited to use it so I hopped right on (I'm already used to ellipticals) and enjoyed a great workout.  I was sweating and after watching the training dvd, I worked my upper body and lower body.  

I look forward to using it tomorrow.  Now I don't have to drag myself to the gym.  I can work out at home!  

Downsides:  It does squeak, but some WD40 or petroleum jelly should fix that.  It folds up but it's not extremely portable.  I have it in my living room currently.  

All in all I recommend this product.  I can feel the toning and with good diet and weight training, you'll see results

This was bought for my boyfriend and I to sleep on when he comes to town. It is very comfortable and there is a lot of room for us!  It loses a tiny bit of air during the night but not so much that it is on the floor or anything.  It is a little difficult to get up off of it in the morning because it is like a water bed. If you get a good wave going you can jump right up!  The other problem I had with it is that it makes me sweat.  Even with the covering and a sheet. I am still sleeping on vinyl and so I sweat.  Not a lot but it is noticeable in the morning.  I am happy with the fact that it holds a lot of weight too because I am a big woman and my boyfriend is a big man. It holds us with no problem.  It was over all a very good purchase and I am happy with it

When the product came I realized that it wasn't what I was looking for in a fanny pack but I was impressed with its rugged construction.  I needed a pack to walk around Disney World and thought the two water bottle holders would come in handy.  I like to freeze my store bought water bottles so that they stay cold all day.  The water bottles that come with this pack are double wide and have a wide top - meaning you can't wrap your lips around it like a store bought bottle. Plus you have to wash and refill them as opposed to just buying another Dasani.  Unfortunately, you can't use the water bottle holder for anything much narrower than the included bottles because there is just a single strap across the bottom preventing their bottle from falling through but that wouldn't stop a regular 16 oz. job from slipping passed.  So I'm returning mine, but if your looking for non breakable, wide mouthed water bottles, in a rugged waistpack then this is for you.   PS for some reason the blue one is cheaper, at least when I bought it

  The bar itself is exactly what I wanted.  The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the troubles I had on the purchase.  The bar arrived literally hanging out of the box, the box was really, really torn up.  The collars that spin on the ends were not even with the bar, needless to say the bar was useless untill I finally found some collars on ebay.  Amazon refunded all my $$ as soon as they were aware of the problem.  Overall the bar is great

I have been buying this brand of prescription goggles for at least 10 years. The price has been gradually coming down each year. I was surprised to find them so reasonably priced at Amazon of all places. These fit well, adjust easily and are extremely durable. I swim 6 days each week and I can easily get over a year of use from each pair. Typically the gaskets begin to deteriorate long before the lenses, when used daily outdoors in chlorinated pools. Keep them stored safely so the lenses don't scratch and rinse them in clear water after swimming and you'll be thoroughly satisfied with your purchase

This is a great pair of swimming goggles.  I swim a couple of times a week and I can't see a thing without my glasses.  This pair is very comfortable and does a great job correcting my vision.  I can't imagine swimming without them.  They have a wide field of vision, the adjustment is easy to use, and stays adjusted.  I've never had a problem with leaking.  For less then twenty dollars you can't go wrong. They are the best goggles I have ever owned.  Much better then the other brands.  

Also, I recommend going slightly less then your current prescription, as the water will magnify things.

And so does Gadget Dad and Gadget Kids.

Not only is it an affordable piece of equipment, but it's great for the whole family.

Having twin boys age 13 and a husband and I who all added a few pounds of winter wool over the last few months, we really needed something that was going to fit nicely into our busy lives.  This does just that!

I'll admit, I was a bit upset when I found that Gadget Dad had ordered it because I was the normal skeptic, but it's been well worth the investment and then some

I purchase my total gym and though it did not give me the workout that I expected, It did help me to get firmer and leaner in a short period of time. I wish it offered more of a workout for the legs but overall, I am very happy with my gym and I use it all the time. Only a 20 minute workout 3 times a week made a huge difference in the way I look

I got this accessory with my Door Gym and I like it.  But, when they say this is an "efficient" accessory - they mean it.  It simply rests on the narrower neutral grip posts of the Door Gym.  The Door Gym has multiple grip areas, but two of them are perpendicular to the rest of the bar for narrow neutral grip chin ups.  The Broad reach bar is wide with downward grips (like lat pull down bar in a gym).  

Anyway, this works fine if you have the faith to try it the first time and prove to yourself it won't roll off because your body weight has it pinned on the posts. It has foam covering that adheres to the foam on the Door Gym posts. It will not roll easily, but it does a little. I think it is safe for adults who understand how to use it.  Do not give it to kids younger than about 15 (in my estimation) because some of them are too likely to play with, or misuse, it and get hurt.

Even though this thing works and does what you want a broad bar to let you do, I deducted a point in the rating because I don't think  they were up front in explaining exactly what it is and is not

This is a must have if you own the compatable shotgun. But a good tip if you get it would be to dump your bbs into another container and check through them for imperfections. (They will jam the magazine)

Pros:

- Very high cap! More than enough for a spring gun!

Cons:

- A bit long, and protrudes from the bottom of the gun quite a bit. (But still worth it

I've had this knife and their rainbow leak model for few years. All I wanted was a thin, small and light knife and I got it. The blade material is hard enough to stay sharp for a while, soft enough to easily sharpen but not brittle like a ceramic or carbon steel knife for example. I have had the vary tip break a couple times but it's because I was doing something foolish with it (like using it as a throwing knife *wink wink* ;) ). It's not the best, it's not the worst but can compete with ether, witch is the best in my opinion. Shortly after I bought it the speed safe spring broke, eehhh who cares it opens fine without. It's vary well made it can take all of my fat butts weight easily when laying sideways on a hard surface. It's vary thin profile is comfortable and I sometimes can't tell if I have it with me or not. It has what looks like brass or copper washers/bushings instead of cheap thin steel/plastic ones (means no binding up, even when in need of oil). The frame lock is far stronger than a line lock and best of all it deforms and wares much slower meaning my knife will stay ridged when opened for a long time.

My favorite thing about it is the fact you can position the clip henge up or down. I chose henge down so it's ready to open the second it comes out of my pocket.

If you want nice quality and availability for the price, kershaw is worth looking at

The knife is sleek and has a great profile. I love the speedsafe function on it. The blade lock is a bit stiff, but I suppose that's just so it doesn't slide open on accident

I purchased this pedometer to replace one that kept resetting itself back to zero ... the case cover on this one protects the buttons so it doesn't reset. I like the fact that I can open the lid and read the LED without taking it off. My only problem is the little leash ... it came with both a plastic and a metal clip.  The plastic clip has lost it's "springiness" and I'm sure will stop working soon; but at least I have the metal clip to fall back on

This pedometer is easy to set up and use.  I tested its accuracy at the local highschool track by walking a 1/2 mile, and sure enough, my pedometer read 1/2 mile. The clip is sturdy, I haven't had any problem with the device falling off.  The leash is a good extra - if it did fall off, it wouldn't hit the ground.  My doctor gave me a goal of 10,000 steps per day, so I wear this all day long.  It is light and I don't notice I am wearing it throughout the day.

The only downfall to this device (as is probably true with others)is that your stride is measured for walking, so when you are running or doing other cardio activity (elliptical) it doesn't accurately measure your distance.  Since your stride is longer during a cardio activity (running), and the device is measuring your walking stride, the distance measurement falls short.  However, the actual number of steps taken is still accurately measured.  I suppose you could adjust the setting to a running stride when running to bridge this gap

I take a Ringside Boxing class at my gym and everyone bought these gloves and really likes them.  I ordered them from online because it was the only place I could find a size small.  I am very happy with them.  They offer excellent wrist support and protection for your fingers.  I really like the bar in the palm to help you grip when making a fist.  They do tend to leave your hands a little black after sweating in them, but it washes right off.  The only thing bad I have to say is that after only a couple of times of using them, the threading started to come apart at the pinky finger.  It can be sewed up, but you shouldn't have to do that so soon after the purchase.  No one else in my class seems to have had this problem.  I still gave them 4 stars, because I have a hunch that the threading isn't a common problem and I love them otherwise

I've been using these gloves for 3 years now and I had to buy a new pair as they were starting to be ripped off between the fingers.

What I like: 
easy to set
good wrist support
good grip with the middle bar

What I don't like:
using wraps can be difficult if you don't take a size above and I recommend wraps otherwise the leather will burn your skin.

For the price and the time that I've used them (2-3 times a week on heavy bags), they performed very well

These cars can be summed up in two words FUN and LOUD.  I have two and my four year old loves it and so do all his friends.  They work great throughout the house and hold their charge really well.  I am even thinking of getting a third.  They do leave little marks on the wood floors but it cleans easily.  Well worth it.

We bought these so the children could have something to play with during the winter.  We backed our vehicles out of the garage, and zoom....they were off having fun.

The box says "Ages 3+" and up to 55 pounds.  The bumper buggie looks small, but it is roomy enough for my 5 1/2 year old.  He weighs 45 pounds and is 45 inches tall.  He can stretch his legs out in the car, but chooses to keep his knees bent while driving.  My two year old can also work the controls.

It is easy to use and the kids can do a complete 360.  My only complaint is that it is a little bit noisy, but no more than other battery-operated vehicles.

I highly recommend this item.  It is so much fun!  Best part is that there is little assembly required.  The only thing we had to do was screw the seat into the car

It was suprisingly easy for me to put together considering I'm a 110lb girl. It only took about 3 hours but i did have trouble getting all the screws to get into their proper holes. It is slightly rickitty however I can go as fast as i want to and it won't brake or anything. It really is nice to be able to lose 200 calories while you watch your favorite T.V. shows.  Also, I am very tall and I had plenty of space, and it's nice to have the handle bars in the front and on either side. 

If you are looking for a reasonably priced bike that won't brake on you, Marcy is a good choice

This thing is great - my wife put it together in half an hour and she's an idiot. Nonetheless it is very solid.
As a long time alcoholic I have a hard time getting up and a harder time going up and down stairs or walking in the grocery store, etc. Because this thing is low I can have the tv on, a drink on the floor on one side and my cigarettes on the floor on the other side and can reach them both while I pedal! I did 1 mile the first day at medium drag (despite what other reviewers have said there is a HUGE difference in drag between settings), 2 miles the second and am up to 5 miles per day now -  now I can drive my car to the store because my legs work again - this thing is really good. Plus it's silent - dropping two ice cubes in a glass makes more noise as does lighting a Bic lighter. But it is made in China... Note: shipping was free and it came in just a couple of days

If you're looking for a basic model without all the bells and whistles, this is an excellent choice. It's also very quiet and it's compact size was definitely on of the selling points for me. Only problem is that I wish the seat adjustment were easier to work. It gets a little stuck sometimes. Again, if you are looking for a basic model this is a good choice

For the price this low-end home gym is generally able to do the things I wanted a cheap home gym to do.  However, there are a few issues you need to consider before buying it.  The biggest issue is ergonometric - this unit is not designed to be used by anyone over perhaps 5'10" or 5'11".  I'm 6'1" and this creates problems for me.  I have to find work-arounds to use a unit designed for people smaller than me.  The problem is that form is very important when doing the exercises (when you don't pay attention to form, you either reduce the effectiveness of the exercise or risk injury) and finding work-arounds sometimes compromises your form during the exercise.
There are also a few quality issues but these were not entirely unexpected considering the price of the unit.  It would have been nice if the bench padding were a little better but its adequate.  The two most annoying quality issues involve the plate bars (the bars that hold the weights).  This first issue was with the plate bar on the lat tower (cable) unit.  It wasn't level.  This means the weights keep trying to fall off one side as you put them on.  The second issue is also with the plate bars.  The unit is designed to accommodate standard plates (small holes in the middle) or Olympic plates (big holes in the middle).  A "sleeve" is included with the unit that slips over the standard size plate bar that enables one to use Olympic plates (big holes).  However the outer diameter of the sleeve is slightly smaller than standard Olympic size so an Olympic size spring collar (to hold the weights on the bar) is too big and doesn't work.  I went down to Home Depot and bought wood clamps to hold the plates in place.  Kind of a pain but functional (just another work-around).  If you buy this unit you probably want to go with standard plates (small hole) rather than Olympic plates (big hole).
So I put this at 4 stars because for this price you really can't expect too much and it generally delivers what I expected a cheap home gym unit to do - with the one caveat:  persons over 5'10" should try to find a home gym designed for taller people.  Since only 5% of the US population is over 6 feet tall manufacturers tend to design for smaller people.  If you're tall, good luck on that search

I bought the V2000 last year and it has worked great since then.  The compass has always given me accurate directions and has lasted through one winter and one summer so far.  I always left my V2000 in the vehicle, although the manual did state that you should take the device with you when the temperature is hot.  The V2000 has visible at all situations.  I can see it clearly in the dark with the V2000's automatic backlight, and see it clearly on a sunny day.  Finding a good place to put the temperature probe, however, is a hassle if you want to get accurate results.  Calibration was also a hassle for me.  You have to be on leveled ground and make a fairly even circle in order to get accurate readings.

*****
This is an upscale designer water bottle, top of the line, and so much fun. The designs Of Sigg's water bottles are gorgeous, from the plain, solid color bottles, to the ones with intricate designs. They are simply beautiful! I switched from regular plastic water bottles because of health concerns, thinking it would take more work to maintain. These do necessitate regular cleaning (I clean mine every day), but having something so beautiful to drink from makes the cleaning fun. Sort of like my rings, glasses, and watch, I now consider my Sigg personal water bottle a vital accessory, reminding me to drink more water, making a statement about my values, and expressing myself with a special design. Yes, all in a water bottle!

Sigg of Switzerland water bottles are very high quality, made of light aluminum on the outside, slightly insulated, and covered with a special powder coat on the inside that prevents any leaching whatsoever, unlike plastic and polycarbonate water bottles. They are light, durable, and perfect for any activity. Well water tastes spectacular in these bottles, just like from the tap.

Sigg bottles come with several different types of tops. I bought the screw top because I don't like sports tops, and I don't mind unscrewing the top when I want a drink. It is totally leakproof, which is important to me. The top is pretty and can be hooked onto a carabiner. I get comments on it all the time, "What's that? I love it!" The sports top version is ok; I just am not a fan, as I don't feel like I can get enough water from the little stream from the sports top. However, for convenience, you might prefer it. For children, there is a cap-type top. All are leak-proof. If you are ever unsatisfied with the top, you can buy a screw top separately to fit your Sigg bottle.

Sigg makes their personal water bottle in .6L and 1L in this style. I have both. I use the .6L for sports activities because they are smaller. When I won't have to carry the container, I like the larger bottle. Sigg also makes a smaller .3L bottle for children that is a perfect size for young people. You can buy Siggs in alternative sizes too, such as .75L, .4L (for kids), .6L, .5L. You can occasionally find this bottle in the 1.5L size, also. Search Amazon for the perfect size.

Pick a style and pattern you like, as this bottle is a personal accessory, and should reflect your style. The colors are vibrant and even prettier than they seem in the pictures on Amazon.

They are expensive, but they are so durable that you can plan on them lasting many years. I consider them both an accessory and an investment in my health, so they are well worth it value-wise for me.

Highly recommended.

This cooler is the perfect fit and size for our boat! The compact size was the main reason for buying this cooler. The lid is easy to open and close and it doubles as an extra seat.  It keeps everything nice and cold all day on the boat.

I was very hesitant to purchase this bike because of all the problems other people reported with parts coming damaged/rusty. The only problem I had was the bar on the rear-bottom wouldn't fit all the way into the slot to put one of the screws in. I tried really hard to get it in, but it just wouldn't budge. Luckily, I could get the screw in on the other end, so it is relatively secure. 
The bike is a bit wobbly when your riding - now I don't know if this is because of my problem with the bar, or because that's just the way it is. but I don't feel like it's going to fall apart or tip over or anything.
Over all, this is a really nice bike. The price is absolutely the best for what you're getting - especially if you choose the free super saver shipping. I got mine about a week from the day I ordered it. I don't think you will find another bike comparable to this for the price. Most recumbent bikes at this price don't offer any kind of resistance, what to speak of programs or the pulse monitor. 
It is really quiet - I can do it at 5 in the morning while my daughter is sleeping in the next room and not have to turn the TV up too loud. The seat is a bit uncomfortable, but it's not that big of a deal considering the price

The bike arrived in fine condition, no problems with bent or rusty parts like other people have reported.  It was really easy to assemble.  Once I had assembled it I tried it out and found that it made a really annoying noise as the wheel went around - as if the gears were scraping against something.  So, I undid all the screws (a pain) and opened the plastic-enclosed base.  There was a bracket that was meant to hold the pulse wires out of the way, but the adhesive on it had worn off or something and it was just kind of hanging, and would interfere with the gears.  So I taped it to the side, closed the plastic up, and that was that.  

Since then the bike has worked really well.  I wish there was more ability to move it back - it is a good length for me but I can see how someone taller could have trouble with it.  The seat is not terribly comfortable, which gets to be a problem on longer rides, but it's fixable with a pillow or cushion.  The console is great - has all the information displayed all the time.  Plenty of resistance.

Overall there are some problems with it, but for under two hundred dollars, I suppose I can't complain too much.  Definitely worth the money

This is an excellent product.  My 7 year old son had ADHD and he is constantly moving.  He has to take medicine to focus at school during the day and moves non-stop from waking up to going to bed at night.  His teacher was happy with his attention at school, but he was still fidgeting a lot.  She gave him this "Wiggle Seat" for his desk and has seen an amazing improvement in his ability to focus and and participate in class.  My son has noticed as well.  He has a hard time sitting at the table when doing his homework at night.  He told me I needed to get him a "Wiggle Seat" for home because it helps him concentrate.

If you have a child with ADHD and you're looking for alternatives to medication, this is a great product to try.  And they'll get great posture as a bonus! :

Great flooring system for a home weightlifting gym. It's heavy and very dense, very similar if not the same type of stuff you see in most commercial gym's. Heavy duty, takes dropped dumbbell punishment, and resists damage/cuts. Use a drywall T-Square as a guide, and put a new blade in a box cutter. Take several passes to cut it and take your time. It cuts straight and square for a professional look. I will definitely buy these again when I get a bigger room for the gym

Dear Amazon,
     My new royal blue Armour duffle bag is the best travel bag I have ever owned.  It is durable beyond anything I have ever had and its design is beautiful with the honey combed stiching and perfectly balanced color design of blue and black.  I actually ordered a small royal blue carry-on duffle directly from Under Armour so the two match and I am utterly pleased.  Under Armour is definitely a KEEPER!!!!!

I already have a set of standard Bones Swiss, but since I was putting together a longboard with smaller wheels, I decided to get slightly faster bearings to make up for it.  These definately firt the bill, and the with the cheap $35.00 price and free shipping that Amazon offers, you can't go wrong.  These may seem dissappointing at first, but after about 3-5 hours of riding, they'll break in and go very fast.  Overall very reccomendable to anyone in the skateboard world

Just a really great sports toy for kids. My son is 9 and he is already pretty good at it, but it is hard to keep my 15 year old from stealing it and riding it himself.  I would highly recommend the flowboard for lots of outdoor fun.

My 13 yr old wanted this and a waveboard for Christmas.  Since his dad and I are divorced, he ended up with both.  I got him the flowboard and he LOVES it.  Of course, I tried it too and was shocked to find it was actually easier for me to play with than his regular skateboard.  There is no chance I'm even going to try the waveboard, as I do value my intact bones.  I've been wanting to learn how to snowboard and this definitely gives the feeling of snowboarding, but without the snow!  It's well made, fun and definitely a hit

THe swim belt I ordered was awesome.  Perfect for my 3 year old to learn how to swim.  The great thing about it is that you can adjust their bouyancy.   Take one or two of the floaty squares off and they have to try to swim a little harder.  It also helps them keep the correct body position for learning how to swim

I would just like to tell everyone who didn't understand the use of this item...They aren't actually anti-gravity boots!  They are used for a type of exercise called inversion where you put the boots on and attatch them to a bar hanging either from a wall or cieling, so in other words, you hang upside down with these boots while attatched to a bar.  They are in no way meant to make you float, or fly, or anything else that can only be found in sci-fi magazines..

These are good to keep on hand for hiking for that quick energy and I also try to keep some of these or a smiliar product in my purse if my blood sugar drops.  I am not a diabetic, but I have gotten low blood sugar my whole life and when I get it I use this or something else to get it back up fast so I can be comfortable.  This really works and tastes great too.  They really did well with this product.  I like to go geocaching and I get out for a long while on hikes this is great to have in the backpack when I need quick fuel

I own several Pelican cases.  When I saw the options for cases for my MacBook, I knew that this case would be just what I needed.

The MacBook 13.3" fits snugly inside the case.  The case says 13" notebooks, but the extra width of the MacBook is accepted.  The case is shipped with small foam large and small spacers.  I used the large spacers but placed them inside the top lid of the case so that the notebook screen wouldn't be opened when I opened the Pelican.

I don't have any worries now when I toss my notebook into a backpack and travel.  I felt uneasy about having to take my notebook out of my Pelican 1510 carry-on case when gate-checking my carry-on luggage for small regional jets

I bought this for my son (recommended by his special ed teacher) and the whole family has been using it ever since.  It's a nice, sturdy, trampoline and it's not too expensive.  The "folding" part is a little disappointing which I why it's not getting full stars.  However, we haven't needed to use that feature so it wasn't that important to us.  Overall this is a good quality trampoline for those who are looking for something less expensive

I purchased this for Christmas for my 8 year old son to play with.  It was $329 with free shipping compared to $450 at the local sports store.  The finished product looks great, appears to be rugged and stable and is quite easy to adjust.  I only gave it 4 stars because assembly was not easy, and I am mechanically inclined. Practically all the holes needed to be drilled or reamed out in order to accept the bolts and the directions were ambiguous.  It was a 4 hour assembly, with filling the base with screened sand really taxing my patience.  But the smile on the 8 year old's face was well worth the aggravation.    

On a side note, I ordered 70% of my Christmas shopping from Amazon, with everything except this arriving before the estimated delivery date (everything else shipped UPS).  They shipped this via DHL, which never delivered the package.  I had to drive 120 mile round trip to pick it up at the DHL facility and take time off of work the Friday before Christmas to retrieve my son's primary gift.  I emailed Amazon requesting $70 credit to reimburse me for my time and gas, which they did in a few days.  This was an oversized package that I assume UPS would not accept.  Nonetheless, their choice of shippers reflects on Amazon as a company.

I've worked out with Cathe for about 6 months now, and I have to say, this is one of my favorite workouts.  It combines cardio with upper and lower body in a 60 minute circuit workout.  

The cardio bursts are short but intense- expect to jump, do Power 15's, fast feet shuffles, spike lunges, etc.  Lower body work - well, let's just say, I hope you like to do leg press- since you'll be doing it  - A LOT.  There are a total of 6 sets of leg press - on each leg.  Also, Cathe inserts some static lunges and squats, among other moves.  She does hover squats with pulses of 16 over the high step- your quads will be feeling the burn, there!  Arm work includes typical weighted and non-weight work, such as tricep dips off the high step, push ups, bicep curls, overhead extension, etc.

Overall, if you're looking for a challenge and a new circuit workout to shock your muscles, this is the workout for you.  Beginners, beware- you can modify certain exercises (I use dumbbells instead of a barbell) - but this is more for the intermediate or advanced exerciser

I recently recieved this watch as a Christmas gift.  I am amazed at the amount of information this watch can gather.  I can check my altitude, see if a storm is brewing, and time each lap of my mile jog.  Everthing works great and is very accurate.  After a glance through the instruction manuel I was able to use and set all the functions with ease.  I love the feel of the band; it is a perfect fit for my wrist.  I would reccomend the stainless steel for best look and price.  This watch is truly fun to use and show off.  It is the perfect watch

You'll never mistake the Shake flashlight for a powerful spotlight, but that's not it's purpose.  It's a niche item, the perfect flashlight to stick in your car trunk or emergency bag and then forget about it.  With no batteries or bulbs, you know it'll always be ready for use whenever you need it.

When it first arrives, you'll need to shake it hard for a couple minutes to charge it up, but just think of it as aerobic exercise.  Once it's charged, it provides sufficient light to read instructions or maps, determine colors of wires or diagrams, and keep you from stumbling around in the dark.  I was surprised by just how bright the Shake flashlight was after about 3 minutes of hard shaking.  The only improvement I can think of would be to have a small diode glow when the flashlight is turned off.  When the light begins to dim, a few shakes will keep the light strong enough to use.

Unlike the previous reviewer, I had absolutely no problems with delivery - I ordered it on 12/26 (non-expedited mail) and it arrived on 12/30, exactly as described

I am very impressed with the F4. It is very easy to use and a good basic heart rate monitor. It is easier to program than my F6, and it fits better.

Polar makes the best HR monitors, and it works with all their chest straps - coded and uncoded, and even with ones that are not from them. I have Vision Fitness exercise equipment, and the strap works with their HR function. Sometimes I strap the watch to the equipment so I can read while I exercise, and I'm able to continually see the HR without constantly changing the view on the equipment.

The color is more of a gray color than an ice blue, so it goes with just about anything you wear. I'm really looking forward to using this unit while I go out and do my walks this spring! 

I can't imagine buying anything else but Polar. This is my third watch and all three of them are still working well

I love this watch!  It's easy to use.  It's also a very basic watch.  It gives your heart rate, zone and calories burned.  It's very nice for what it is supposed to do.  If you're looking for a watch with a lot of bells and whistles, this is not the one for you.  It looks nice and it's not too bulky.  The only reason I would have gotten the F6 is because it says it has something that prevents "cross talk" (interference with others wearing a heart monitor watch.  There are three of us where this same exact watch in my cycling class and we've never had a problem with "cross talk."  As the other reviews said, there is no backlight.  Would recommend

I bought this for myself to play with (I'm 35) and after all the presents were opened and toys, video games, and everything were forgotten (about 4 hours after Christmas), this was the ongoing favorite of the season.  Everybody, younger (down to 8) and older (to 45) had a blast with this thing after a couple minutes coaching. It's already on everybodys wish lists for upcoming birthdays and such.  This is a GREAT present for 11-18 boy. Fair warning though, there will be some good spills on the fairly short, steep learning curve - helmets, knee pads, blah, blah, are a must (and a video camera!

I bought this from lifeline recently and it has been an EXCELLENT addition to my home gym equipment.  I'm not a person who travels back and forth to a gym each day.  I also do not like paying an arm and a leg for expensive pieces of workout equipment that eventually become expensive coat racks.  

This workout solution is about as low tech as it can get.  I agree with the previous reviews below--you could almost make this one yourself.  It consists of a strip of mesh webbing--like seatbelt material; two adjustable, quick locking clips; handles made of webbing and plastic tubes; and another piece of plastic tubing that locks the Jungle Gym into place when the door is shut.  The equipment is simple, but sets up in seconds.  The clips adjust quickly and are incredibly secure.

It's so simple--but it really works.  The emphasis of the instruction sheet and the DVD that came along with it, is in upper body strength.  You can do chin ups--by regulating height, you can work up from lifting part of your body weight to full body weight.  For me, this was the best part of the Jungle Gym.  My chin ups/pull ups have improved remarkably by using the device.

Body rows, push ups, and fly push ups are also possible.  Using the Jungle gym, pushups take on a new dimension with a fuller range of motion (like an Atlas pushup)and given the instability of the webbing, you also get more of a core workout.  

You can use the webbing for balance as well as to maintain better technique when doing squats.  You can also make the exercises more challenging by using a fitness ball.  You can do abdominal crunches by holding the handles and lifting your feet from the floor.

Some exercises (full body rows and dips) are difficult when attached to a door and Lifeline suggests draping the Jungle Gym over a tree limb so you can achieve a truly vertical workout.  I have not yet tried using this over a tree limb...  However, I was able to perform the dips with some creativity while attached to a door but it was not easy.

This is not a full fitness solution.  But when used in conjunction with weights and exercise bands, it really makes the home gym complete.  I have searched for a pull up bar for a long time that is removable, but none of the current offerings fit the odd sized door frames and moldings of my 99 year old house.  The Jungle Gym has worked.  Given the ability to do pull ups of varying difficulty, it has also improved my ability to do pull ups/Chin ups over a short period of time.

The downside of the device is that it requires a STURDY DOOR and DOOR FRAME.  I would be leery of using the device is the door does not close securely AND LOCK or if you are worried about the integrity of your house's construction.  Remember, the Jungle Gym is strong enough to hold your body weight, but the door it is connected to has to be able to do the same.  If not, you will find yourself flat on your back with a new home improvement project to do.  Remember too, that when your feet are touching the ground and you do pull towards the door, the weight decreases as you pull. This is not a defect of the device, it's just the physics of the situation.  (With free weights, the weight is stable throughout your range of motion.  With exercise bands the weight increases as the band lengthens.)  Also, this is a great device for weight/circuit training, but is not really an aerobic solution.

The Jungle Gym, along with a few exercise bands are IDEAL for travel.  I used mine with three lifeline exercise bands (2 R6s and 1 R8), exercise band door attachment and the lifeline triple grip handles.  This yielded a gym that weighed less than two pounds, fit in my suitcase easily and allowed for a variety of body weight and resistance exercises

except for the nifty little metal clips that keep the strap at the length you set until you press on it to lengthen/shorten the strap again. Does exactly what it is supposed to do, and makes for challenging exercises due to the inherent instability. Great for spotting oneself too. I would buy it again, tho I don't think it is as indispensible as some might have you believe. So if you can burn the $35 or so, get it with no fear. Otherwise, use your frustration to fuel your desire to workout

I bought this item after much research and this particular model was suggested to me by a friend.  No problems at all with shipping; package was in perfect shape though only delivered to my back steps.  I opened up the box and brought in pieces individually, with the flywheel being the heaviest (though I was able to bring in myself).  It took me about 2 hours to put together.  Instruction book was better than most I have seen, and only problem was the misprint in bolt sizes, but you can figure that out easily (as everyone has noted on their reviews).  The elliptical's size is on the smaller size and fits well in my sitting room.  Easily moved if need be.
In regards to the workout.  I cross train on my treadmill and found this workout to be as effective.  There are a variety of programs so you can vary your workout.  The backward motion is a little awkward for me (I am 5'3") but found that holding onto the lower handlebars works well (versus the movable upper ones).  The machine is very quiet, only slight squeeking coming from the upper handlebars that disappeared with a little WD40.  It has very smooth movement and you can definitely tell a difference with increasing the level, which I was worried about as it doesn't have an incline as some gym machines do.  The heel rise can occur when you do not sit back on your heels when working out, so you just need to be aware of your foot placement.  The foot pads are comfortable and a good size.  
Most of all, for those who do monitor their heart rate, I have a Polar F11 heart monitor (with chest strap) and this monitor is within a 3 beat difference at the most.  I recommend to let the monitor read for a minumum of 45 seconds before you follow the rate.  This held true for me even if pacing at 70 RPM's or above.  I listen to my IPOD when I work out, so I have not used the book holder.  The water holder holds 24 oz Polar Spring bottles without any difficulty taking out and replacing the bottle.
I highly recommend this for anyone who is looking at increasing their fitness level in the comfort of their own home.  It's very well built/solid, quiet, effective, and affordable ($599, free pad, free shipping)

My husband and I finished off a bottle of wine before assembling the unit. : ) It only took us an hour and a half to assemble, and our kids were running around like a couple of nuts during the process. After we finished the assembly, we both took a turn on a preset program. The machine is extremely sturdy, quiet, and worked like a charm - just like a unit found at a gym. We're extremely pleased with our purchase and would recommend it to anyone

Just purchased this chair 3 wks ago and so far so good!  I use it almost every morning for 15 minutes while I watch the news.

Needed a chair like this because I'm starting to get a gut and my pants are getting too tight.  I hate exercizing and definitely don't have the will/motivation to go to the gym consistently.  I bought the ultra version because I needed to be able to hide it away when it isn't being used.  Once folded up (4 1/2 inches tall - 29 inches wide - 39 inches long) it fits very nicely under my couch.

It is fairly easy to fold up/unfold but it could be easier which is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.  There are 2 bungee type straps that need to be unhooked, 2 curved handle bars need to be removed (simple twist knobs), and one stabilizer bar undone (simple twist knob) to fold this unit down.  Removing the parts and folding the unit takes less than 2 minutes.  Not difficult just wish it was easier.

Overall, I would definitely make this purchase again knowing what I now know.

I worked with Eureka to design this exclusive tent for Amazon.  (Note: I work at Amazon and am biased),...but want to share why we built this tent for Amazon customers.

Eureka is one of the best names in the Outdoors industry.  Their Timberline tent design has been one of the most popular tents for decades.  They have built on that innovation, and I believe build the best "family camping tents" in the business.  

This tent was designed to offer customers an incredible value for a large family tent that has all the special features for a good-sized family:
- Spacious  and big.  It has a center height of 7 feet, and feels huge.  It's a 11x11 and gives you 121 square feet.  You can fit 2 queen sized airbeds quite comfortably
- Easy assembly.  Shock-corded fiberglass poles and ring-and-pin systems make for an easy set-up with 2 folks.  
- Quality.  From seams that are sealed to high quality mesh.  This tent is designed for rugged use through 3 seasons.

As I re-read this review, I realize I haven't done a sufficient job in highlighting the spacious feel of this tent.  7 foot center height is tremendous!

It works as advertised. Not a lot to say about a bike rack. I have hardly any wobble from mine, and I suspect those that do didn't assemble theirs correctly or aren't tightening the hitch pin bolt down far enough. My only complaint is the weight--it uses a really heavy steel tube for the vertical portion of the rack, which I don't quite understand. The vertical tube has the lowest load, with the highest load being on the hitch draw tube. But it's not that big a deal. It just increases the weight on the rear of the car needlessly

We also bought this bike rack because of the price and it will hold 4 bikes.  It could be improved on the Hitch end but it was not bad.  It does tend to loosen at highway speeds but we use it with the larger attachment for class 3 hitches.  It kept our bikes from damaging our Suburban.   We use it for adult bikes and also several smaller BMX bikes.  It is more challenging to get the BMXs on.  One trick is to make sure you swing the arm down to mount the one inside bike, then tilt it back up for the other three.   Also use a wrench and tighten the hitch bolt very tight with the lock washer or it will loosen on the highway. We also bought a big Schwin cable lock to run through the bike frames for security while parked

Neoprene pouch keeps water cool, but it has a very strong displeasing smell, kind of like used motoroil, which overpowers the taste of what your drinking from the bottle. So you might want to pour your drink into a cup to enjoy it.

This item garners the same complaint that I have with the Aqua Sphere pull buoy: it floats, is functional, but nicks/gouges very easily.  I try to keep this away from the sharper objects in my swim gear bag (snorkel, fins), but it still gets dented, nicked, scratched, and gouged.  Regardless, it works quite well and I really like the smooth underside, the ribbed handholds, and the ample crescent at the base (perfect for kicking with my head down into the water).  One of the best parts is that it isn't as small as a kid's kickboard, but it's not huge, either.  Really good product overall

I just recently baught this weight tree since i had a weight bench and I needed a place to put the 400 lbs. besides the floor.  The the weight tree does hold that much weight and could hold more, the only thing I do not like is that it does bend in a little, when you put the max weight on a slot.  But it does its job

Treadmill sets up fairly quickly, unless you are a moron, then it might take you some time.  The pistons are stiffer than I thought they would be, allowing for a very challenging upper body workout.  I usually row while I am watching TV or a game, and have never had to turn up the volume because of the noise - it really is very quiet.  Unless you are looking for a health club quality rower, this rower would be a very good pick for nearly anyone

I had one of these similar many years ago and let it go at a garage sale. Dumb idea! As I get older, this Stamina machine has replaced it and is giving me all the exercise I need. Good to set in front of the tv and row for 30 minutes, I've gone from a size 40 to a size 36 waist. I like the hydraulic part of it and the adjustability

I bought this for my medium sized 9mm. Luger with the laser sight attached to it. My cousine, who has been in the Military for several years, recommended it to me. I'm only 3 feet 6 inches tall, and it fits me well. He is over six feet tall, and it fits him just as well. It takes a little time to adjust it to your liking but, well worth the money. It is comprable to holster costing 5 times as much

When I got the machine and started putting it together, I noticed I was missing a few small pieces.  Understandable, I think, as this machine was shipped from Germany.  3$ and a trip to my local hardware store later, the Kettler Kadett was all assembled.  I had some problems with the foot straps loosening while I exercised, but I found that a velcro strap fastened around the toe area (to provide an additional foot strap) and some velcro adhesive slapped on the existing foot strap fixed that problem.  

With the exception of those minor nuisances, the Kettler Kadett is an amazing piece of machinery.  When I use it, I can tell it's not going to break or fall apart at the nuts and bolts.  It went together easily and it's solid as a rock when I use it.  I've never rowed on a real boat in my life, but this feels just as I'd imagine it would.  And of course the most important part, when I get off, I feel like I've gotten a gym quality work out.

4 out of 5 stars for this rowing machine, the packaging could have been better and slightly re-designed foot wraps, but all in all an excellent buy

I had a cheaper version of this product and the strap was flimsy and cut into me in certain poses not to mention that it was too short for many poses.  The hugger-mugger strap is not only long enough but thicker and smoother so it doesn't cut in to my skin and it is comfortable to grip.

Many years ago, an acquaintance of mine was the property manager of a low-rent motel.  One morning, while he was in the back office behind the front desk, two men jumped over the counter and started beating on the door.  He could see them, but they could not see him through the privacy security glass.  The men continued to beat on the door, trying to get in.  He waited inside patiently, with his Glock pistol.  As soon as the door fell and the men ran inside, he shot them both.  They turned out to be high school teenagers who were trying to break in to obtain crack money.  I recalled that many in the community dissaproved of his actions.  It turned out that he had plenty of time to leave through the back door and call for help.  When asked why he had to kill them, he simply said, "I own the life of anyone who threatens my personal safety.  I did it because it was my right and I could."  Fortunately, it was considered self-defense.

I remembered that he always carried a short stick, attached to his keys.  It was not until many years later that I finally figured out what that little wooden stick was.  I became interested in self-defense and decided to buy a baton for myself.

This was my first Kubaton.  I was concerned because this one has a pointed end.  The pointed end, although not sharp compared to a blade weapon, will easily punch a hole through four layers of very heavy cordura cloth with little effort on my part.  I was afraid that if ever I had to use it, the amount of damage it will cause and its design would make it hard for me to claim that I was acting in self-defense.  I bought another Kubaton, from the same manufacturer, with a flat end.  The replacement baton is exactly like this one, except the end is flat.  

I tested the replacement and it will also punch a hole through heavy canvas.  But it takes a lot more force to do so.  More importantly, to the average person, it looks less aggressive than this one.  If I had to use it in self-defense, a presiding judge or jury might be less likely to think of it as a weapon.

If you are not concerned about perception, then get this pointed baton.  If it can easily punch a hole through layers of cordura cloth (the same material used in heavy duty outdoor bags, outerwear, and hiking shoes), it can easily injure an attacker who might be wearing several layers of clothes.  But please understand that some might put this in the same category as they would a knife.  That might make it difficult to claim self-defense, in the event that you have to use it to protect yourself.  

My old acquaintance was well-versed and knowledgeable.  He not only knew how to use his weapons, but he also understood where the line is between self-defense and assault.  He knew just the limits of what he could get away it in the use of deadly force to defend himself.  This pointed baton, made out of hardened aluminum alloy, is probably for such a person.

MY FRIEND'S TIP:

Here's a tip from that old acquaintance of mine.  The keys themselves are a part of the weapon.  And you can make them more effective, which will increase the damage from the baton.  Take some keys that you no longer use.  Any metal key would do, but try to find different sizes.  About four of them would do.  Take the keys to a grinder (even a rasp will do) and sharpen the teeth of each key.  Now, put the four keys in the keyring along with your regular keys.  Face the sharp keys in opposite directions.  Meaning two should face one way, but the other two should face in the opposite direction.  The idea is that when you swing the baton like a flail, the sharpened keys would cut into the attacker's flesh.  The keys are faced in opposite directions so that you can do major damage regardless of which direction that you are swinging.  

CITAN'S EXPERIMENT: 

Please keep in mind that you can also cut your hand.  I tried this technique.  I wore a pair of leather work gloves and swung against a wooden post.  The sharpened keys bounced back and hit the back of my hand.  Without the gloves, my hand would have gotten badly cut.  For what it's worth, I swung against a large watermelon and the keys didn't bounce back though.  I don't have anything else to add here, except maybe it might be good to swing against an attacker's fleshy parts to prevent the keys from rebounding.  I'm not an expert though.  But it was fun trying it on a watermelon

Let me start by saying that I ordered this rowing machine on April 2 and it arrived on April 5!  I was so excited!

Even though it has poor instructions on putting this machine together, it isn't impossible.  The tension strap is twisted around part of the machine that needs to be unwrapped first and that is not mentioned in the instructions.  Also, two of the steps seem to be out of order, but I still give this product a 5 star rating.  

When I was in college, I used a machine like this in their exercise room and loved it.  This is just like it, but I think it's even better.  I don't have a problem with the foot holders on this machine like I did with the one at college.

The quality is great for the value.  I feel that I have enough resistance and that I'm getting the workout that I'm looking for.  I use an elliptical rider first, then I get on my rower.  This is now rounding out my workout and I love it!  My elliptical rider is a gym quality machine and was very expensive but worth the cost.  This rower is inexpensive, but doesn't feel like a cheap machine.  Again, I am thrilled with it. 

By the way, I don't think that you can tell it in the picture, but the fan cover has holes all the way around it.  When I'm working out I can feel the breeze that it is generating.  It doesn't blow me away, but it's enough to cool me off some.

I hope you find the machine you're looking for.  If you're looking to save some money and get a great workout, this may be the rower for you.

Let me start out by saying that this rower is not perfect. It is, in fact,  flawed. As you may have noticed, I still gave it a five star rating and I will try to explain the reasons for doing so.

Reading the reviews here, I noticed two complaints: One pointing out that this machine doesn't perform to the same standards that professional gym rowers do and the other regarding assembly of this machine.

I researched the various rowers available in the market for quite a while. I spent a lot of time and effort driving around and trying various models before purchasing this one simply because I tend to be an informed shopper who wants to get value for his money. During my research, it became very evident that my favorite rower is a Water Rower followed by Schwinn's WindRigger - both were extremely smooth in their operation. Both were also about $1000! At any rate, these sophisticated rowers gave me a benchmark against which to compare the Integrity and it should surprise nobody that the Integrity doesn't really come close to the performance of either of the other two rowers. And it shouldn't, given it substantially lower price.

And this is exactly what it important in considering this rower: You cannot expect to get a professional-grade rower for such a low price just like you cannot expect to get the comfort and performance of a Rolls Royce if you are buying a Honda. Nonetheless, what you DO get from Integrity is well within the parameters of what I would expect for about $200.

The machine is reasonably stable, it is reasonably smooth, and it does provide a great workout. The noise level is also not too bad and actually seems less than that of the WindRigger. The electric monitor is basic and provides speed, time, calories burned, and distance. It also provides an option that continuously cycles through all these functions so you cant track all of them during your workout. The seat is comfortable and slides smoothly along the track and the whole thing actually has a pretty professional look to it and doesn't appear flimsy. I was also quite surprised by the level of resistance this rower provides - it is much more than that of the Schwinn WindRigger. In addition, resistance can be adjusted pretty easily.

I think my only disappointment is that the air-flow created during operation is not channeled toward the person using the machine to aid in cooling him/her down - but this is certainly a flaw I can live with. As a potential buyer you should also be aware that the rower tends to slide across smooth surfaces such as tile - which means you need to have a non-slip mat under it if you intend to use it on such a surface.

As I said before, I also read that at least one person had a problem assembling this rower. I cannot confirm this problem. Assembly was extremely easy and quick - even though the instructions are not the greatest. However, it should be quite clear to most people where parts go and what needs to be hooked up where. Winding up the chain onto the gear wheel is a breeze, too. All you need to do is unhook it from the retracting cord that you hooked it up to one or two steps before. I suppose the person who wrote the instructions could have switched these steps to make it more logical - but as I said, the instructions are not great. 

Taking all these factors into account, I think Integrity provides a fantastic product for a very low price. It does exactly what it is supposed to do and it does so in a surprisingly good manner. However, as with any product, your expectations should be realistic and if they are, you will not be disappointed. If you expect a gym-quality machine - you will not get what you are looking for. If, however, you are looking for a basic functional rower without all the bells and whistles of high-end products, then this is probably the best deal you can get

I wonder why the other reviewer had leaking problems - perhaps a bad silicon seal?  I compared this in store to other products by thermos, no-names, etc, and it is one of the most solidly built food carry products I've ever seen or used.  I should have bought it years ago, and it would have saved hundreds of dollars via home-made lunches.  And jeez, the worry that every time you put tupperware/ziplock lunches in your bag, something is going to leak - how much is that worth to put to rest forever?  I used to wrap my food-carrying plastic wear in TWO plastic bags in case of inevitable leakage.  Never again.  This thing is solid.  

I must admit, it appeals to my guy side, (see my bachelor-style typical lunch and dinner, below) with the hammered green siding and shiny metal parts.  I think I sprouted a few extra hairs on my chest after I bought it.  It looks like something you might dig out of the basement in your parents' house, to which they would say, "Oh, that used to be your grandfather's, and I used it too.  It still works."  They could call it the Man-Jar.  (Ladies, don't be afraid, the thermal properties are gender-blind, and green will be in this fall)

If you got dumped recently by your girlfriend (or wife, or mom, or whatever), this jar can help you in your process of manly rediscovery.  

Despite the fact that spending money is something I generally discourage, this jar will actually help you save money in the long run. 

You could carry it home late at night on the subway as a weapon.  Heck, my cooking is a pretty dangerous payload.


Technical stuff:

I put a heated hamburger patty and microwaved (prev. frozen) vegetables into the container, with a thermometer.  Started at 180 deg. F, and arrived at 140 deg. F four hours later.  

I bought it before a 7-day road trip, living out of a cooler in the back of my car.  I didn't eat a SINGLE crappy fast-food meal, and I didn't spend a dollar on anything but gas.*  All healthy, pre-cooked, home-style, k-dog-style stuff.  Get yourself a Corning wear microwave bowl with a heavy-duty fridge plastic cover, and you have a home-cooked meal at every rest stop.

I've put boiling water in it, let it sit overnight, with the top off, and it was still warm in the morning.  



* And a hotel.  And a speeding ticket.  I musta been so excited to have this food bottle.  Damn ohio pigs

I have been using a headlight for years when I work night shift at the hospital.  When that light gave out, I bought this one.  I like having the three settings of brightness.  

Though I had a light on my bike handlebars, I wanted to get a light that would go on my helmet.  It came down to two choices and I went with the Aurora since I had been impressed with it at work. It turns out that it is brighter than the light I had on my handlebars that I paid more for just last summer.  Now I wish I had gotten an Aurora for my handlebars, also

     I was surprised at how good this worked with very little uncomfortableness while sleeping.  It didnt take much pressure on the toes
to be able to get up in the morning with very little pain on my heal.  Had problems for the last 4 months before the Thermoskin.  Have been using it 2 weeks now and am already trying to slowly get back to running.

The Cold Steel Spike Tanto is a lot of knife for a reasonable price.

It is viciously sharp and will remove arm hair quite easily.  It has a width across the spine of the blade that is unmatched by any knife its size I have ever seen.  Virtually indestructible.  The case is excellent if plain.  This knife leaves very wide wounds in steak; I think stitches would be the only way to close the wounds.

On the down side it doesn't hold an edge very long and its handle is very short and I wear a medium glove.

Overall this is a knife built for the sole purpose of self defense.  It is small to make it easily concealable and comes with its own neck chain.  It is a knife that won't let you down when the going gets tough, used in its intended purpose it should be virtually indestructible and wickedly efficient.

This is the perfect monitor for the average person.  The chest strap communicates with the machines at my gym so I don't have to look at the watch while using the machines.  While walking or jogging the watch provides a quick way to know your heart rate.  I haven't used the other features that are offered so I can't rate them, but it does everything that I wanted out of it when I purchased it

My treadmill came with a heart monitor of the same chest-strap type that only worked about half the time.  I never had a problem like that with this one, once it's on, it keeps reading until I take it off.  It's also compatible with all the treadmills/ellipticals/bikes at the gym, so I don't have to hold the handles any more

I am very happy with this watch. I really enjoy running and I wanted to learn how to get the best benefit from running without over-exertion and injury. The polar website said heart-rate monitoring helps with pace, getting the desired benefits from my run, and helped to reduce injury.

Pros: Works perfectly, immediately picked up by the gym equipment--no holding on required, setting 3 zones for warm-up, running, and cool down was a snap, the audible beeps help me to know when I'm slacking off or working too hard, the constant feedback is very motivating.

Cons: Not many here, however, the screen seems difficult to see in the sunshine. Will have to see the effect of that when spring comes !

I did a lot of shopping online and I liked the Polar M-61 ($130) best but I got this one because of the lower price ($80). The M-61 has more features and is more fashionable; so you may want to look at that one too

I've always loved Victorinox Swiss Army Knives, but I must admit that I when I purchased this one, I was not sure if I made the right choice, but my expectations were soon exceeded.  It was right before a trip to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in Minnesota, I had lost my other Swiss Army Knife (a Tinker), and I was looking for a versatile knife with a locking blade.  I did not need dozens of other tools for my pending stay in the wilderness.  I settled on this one because it was on sale, and I have not been disappointed.

The handle has a mild contour that made it very comfortable to handle.  For its size, it had just the right heft, but it was not too heavy to weigh down my shirt (where I kept it in my buttoned breast pocket).

The 4" locking blade worked wonderfully.  I could close it with either one or two hands.  When closing it, the blade pauses at the halfway point, reducing the risk of closing it on your fingers when closing it one-handed (that said, it does not eliminate all risk, so close the knife with one hand at your own risk).  During my recent canoe trip, I lost my fillet knife on a portage trail and was surprised that cleaning a 24" northern pike with this blade was quite painless (though it did take some skill).

Beyond the blade, I've always found the leather awl and the screwdriver handy, but the can opener blade is a primary reason why I prefer Victorinox Swiss Army knives over those produced by Wegner.

The knife shipped in a simple cardboard box.  A sheath or pouch would have been nice, but I was able to fabricate one with duct tape before my trip.  Since I kept it in my shirt pocket for most of my trip, the sheath wasn't necessary, but it is one accessory you should consider purchasing if you choose this knife.

I recommend getting one.  You will not be disappointed

Here's a secret for the uninformed: This is a very popular scale with people who never weigh a single fish. This is perhaps the best inexpensive package scale you can get, and if you're a regular eBay seller, it's one of the best tools you cna buy for making accurate weighings for estimating shipping charges. With this scale and a plastic bag, you can weigh any package, no matter how irregularly shaped, and get a weight accurate within an ounce or two. But remember- it's a secret

These flashlights are made in China.  That is not too surprising nowadays and is in no way an adverse comment on their quality and construction which seem to live up to what we might hope from a traditional American brand such as Smith & Wesson.  I have two of these and I expect them to last me the rest of my life.  (I am 60.)
 
A tad expensive (which is why only four stars) but small enough to be convenient, bright enough to be useful and efficient enough to be inexpensive to operate.

I bought these flashlights for use during blackouts but their convenience has me using them for illumination whenever I am fiddling around with cables behind the TV or under the office desk or inside the computer.  The small size means they are easy to hold in an armpit or in the same hand as another tool.

I also bought the red-LED version for use in the car so as not to affect night vision

Smith & Wesson is an American arms maker. The flashlight also got solid construction and reasonable weight. The more important aspect is that it uses two AA batteries, which are easy to find and economical. It came with two Energizer AA batteries. Three white LEDs are bright enough for general purposes. I keep it in my car's glove box.

PowerBars were created out of necesity to be efficient, not to taste like a $2.50 gourmet treat similar alot of other bars that have since come out. If you want something that has a food like texture and tastes like food - eat food; like a steak, a piece of cake, or a banana. Power bars were made for energy in the 1980's; people who eat them now got used to them and now actually like them. Power Bars are practically synonymous with the term "energy bar" because they are the time honored benchmark. Try a Cliff Bar or a Snickers if you are looking for something tasty; when you get tired of those and long for something more in life, try a powerbar

Hey,

I decided to review some things I didn't buy off Amazon, but I have owned for sometime that are really great items: the kind I would buy again for sure if they were lost. I would say lost or broken, but Jansport has lifetime warranties! If anything happens to your backpack, all you have to do is mail it to Jansport with a note of the problem, they will fix it for FREE and send it back to you. They will even send you a card while they have it telling you it misses you and will be back soon. Overall, these are such great products, you just have to get a Jansport if you're thinking of a backpack.

Also, I am in a review writing competition with a friend of mine and if this review is helpful, which I hope it really is, I would love to have your yes vote!

With Care, 
Sa

If you have ever been caught at a check out desk or some place in need of a pen and no one has one, then this knife is for you.  

The other day I was at the check out line of the supermarket, and when I went to sign the credit slip, I couldn't as the casher has lost her pen.  I then whipped out my keychain with this on it and quickly signed the form and was on my way.

I highly recommend it for situations like this

I have bought over 20 of these knives.  I trim my nails, open packages, write notes, tighten screws, and strip wire (great for stripping wire).  You can buy replacement toothpicks and pens.  I put toothpicks in place of the twizzers.  I have never used the twizzers in 30 years.  I can use the toothpick a couple times a day.  I would love to see a thinner version with an LED, toothpick and pen. 

Airport security keeps taking my knives.  Remember to remove the pen and toothpick if they do take it.  The pen just pulls out. 

This is the best most used tool I have ever owned

Excellent product.  Great for home use as it folds up and slides right under the bed.  The height is adjustable and it breaks down and stores quickly. Very good quality materials for the price.  I have had my eye on one in the in-flight magazine when I travel but I saved a lot of money buying it here especially since they included free shipping

This Yakima roof rack system works great and I highly recommend it. I bought one for my Mazda 3 and have use it, along with a Yakima roof rack for 2 cross country ski trips (I live a Florida, skiing is far away). The rack hasn't shifted an inch and was relatively easy to install. Yakima has a product guide on their site to make sure you order the right pieces for your model car

I purchased this snorkel equipment for a vacation in Aruba and I used it for 4 days of snorkeling.  I had always rented snorkel gear before and this was the first time I decided to purchase a set.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  The fins are fantastic.  The design of this fin from US Divers with the split in the middle makes it extremely easy to move through the water - it's a great design feature!  The snorkel mask was comfortable and it never leaked.  The set also comes with a great blue and gray backpack that you can store all of your gear in

I bought one of these a while back to use as a day pack for hiking. I find it an absolutely great backpack. It has enough compartments for everything I need to carry as well as a ton of smaller pockets for nick knacks and smaller items.
I found I didn't need the waist belt and never used it as it doesn't do much. (It's not like your trying to get weight to your hips with a small pack like this anyways. I ended up cutting it off. It has a nice carry handle at the top built into the harness that makes it real easy to carry this pack or move it around with one hand when not wearing it.
The padding on the back is very comfortable, I haven't overloaded this pack yet, but with about 15-20 pounds, it's very easy to wear.
It has straps for a skateboard/snowboard, and while I've never used it for those, They make nice straps to lash things on if you wanted to. I also like the cell phone pocket, which I actually do use for a cell phone. I liked that so much that I zip tied my folding knife pocket exactly opposite it.
One downfall for me was the 2 side pockets. Usually used for water bottles . They are quite small. my nagaline 32 oz bottles won't fit in there, though no problem with smaller sizes. The pack is able to be used as a camel back, though I didn't see a bladder specifically made for it.

So in the end, I just bought another one of these for a friends birthday and I'm really impressed with it. I would definatly recomend this pack.

My daughter received this toy for Christmas and at seven weeks old, immediately loved it. My five-month old nephew also received one and loves it as well. It is easy for infants to grab and soft so they don't hurt themselves when they pull it towards their face and mouth. The colors are visually engaging and it has a "nice" rattle sound to it (loud enough to get the child's attention, not too loud to be an annoying toy). I recommend this toy for anyone shopping for a shower or birthday gift.

This is the same toy I was given as a shower gift except mine has a rubber duck in the middle. The women who gave it to me said she got it a a dollar store. Awesome toy for infants since it's light, easy to grip, and easy to bit. My son loved this toy for 2-3 months until he was old enough to move on to bigger heavier toys

This was the first toy my son picked up and put in his mouth at 3 months.  I think he liked it because it is very light and easy to grab on to.  He has found it so entertaining, and I especially appreciated that in his first months when there wasn't a lot I could do with him.  Now I try to include it with all of my baby shower gifts!

 deep gouges caused by feet of sofa where all finish was off  in  2   6"x9" areas were discovered during move-out; this product saved us from complete refinishing of otherwise gorgeous oak floors.
  simply rubbed the felt-like stick over the area, and the gouges seemed to "fill in"!
applied 2 more layers, and were amazed! couldn't tell where they were.

My kids love this game.  They sit down together and play this game all of the time.  The neighbor kids come over to our house because they love to play board games and SORRY is the one they choose the most.  We do not have video games at our house, and this was considered a drawback to the neighbor kids until my kids introduced them to board games.  Now they come over all of the time just to play board games.  I say hide the video games and let the kids interact with each other playing board games.  

Sorry is top game in our house

I bought this kitchen for my 18 mos. old and she really enjoys cooking and working in it.  It is a nice, compact size that doesn't take up too much space.  She can work at all the different stations and not get frustrated.  Another bonus for me was that it came fully assembled and ready to use straight out of the box.  My only complaint would be that the doors are somewhat difficult for my daugter to open, but I know as she gets older, it will become easier.  I would definitely recommend this kitchen to anyone who in interested in purchasing one for their child

This kitchen is not the first one I've purchased. I am more happy with this one than the other two I have purchased. It has plenty of storage space for all the food and gives the child more doors to open and be more creative. I am very happy with this kitchen, it's durable and a good buy

Very pleased with this purchase... My 2 yr. old daughter loves playing with her new kitchen!  The kitchen came fully assembled and all plastic parts are very sturdy.  The telephone is fun - and is actually my daughter's favorite part of the whole kitchen!  I know of 4 other friends who have this same kitchen - and all are pleased with their purchase

My kids grew up overseas and are quite familiar with Renaissance paintings. They've seen many of these paintings and are very familiar with them. I realize this is not the typical situation.

I was disappointed that the game is basically a game of luck. It is not challenging or reinforcing of our kid's knowledge. I had hoped for a game like "Famous Authors" which builds on and tests the level of knowledge of the players. 

Nonetheless, the game is well presented. It's on the expensive side, but the book alone is worth half the price. Looking for a fancy gift with cultural overtones? I recommend this

I received this game as a gift and it really is a great! The book that comes with it would have been a perfect 'Cliff Notes' for the Art History classes I had in school.  My eight-year-old daughter won the first game we played and I'm re-learning lots of stuff I had forgotten. Highly recommended

My 16 month old loves her new groceries.  The produce &amp;amp; sandwich parts are plastic &amp;amp; each piece has a wonderful texture. The canned goods are very interesting to read.  They are actually labeled by a supermarket in the UK, so they are a bit different from the groceries you would find in the US.  I put the cardboard frozen food items away until she is older. She has been entertained at length because each piece is so intricate.  This was a great purchase.

This toy looks very appealing. I purchased this for my son, 16 months at the time thinking it would be a great toy to stash in the kitchen cupboard so he could play while I cooked cleaned etc. He played with it about 4 times total and he's 2 now! It doesn't do enough and does have much other than a shape sorter. I consider it wasted money but if my experience helps anyone I'm glad

Wonderful product. We bought this as a gift for my son's 7th birthday as a fun incentive to get him a little writing and spelling practice.  He loved to make his own books at home with computer paper and the stapler, so a real book was a huge hit.  He thought this was great because it is a real bound book with his own words and pictures.  His book will be a cherished keepsake and I'm sure it will be great fun to look at when he is grown

I can't say enough about Illustory!  My daughter is 6 and in Kindergarten and loved to make stories on paper stapled together. So, Santa brought her an Illustory kit and we did it together as she can't write many of the words yet.  So, she drew all the pictures and told me what she wanted to story to say.  We got our book in the mail yesterday, and she was so thrilled to see her story bound like a real book!  The quality was great, and it even had the dedicaton page and an "about the author" page with her picture (which I provided).  We even ordered an extra copy for grandma with a dedication to her!  I highly reccomend this kit

An unexciting piece. Of value only to the completist collector (like myself). There's nothing wrong with it, it's just that there's nothing "great" about it either. The lauching projectiles are unnecessary for a "holographic" figure. Hasbro could has done better by choosing another "host" sculpt to base this exclusive off of. The "Phantom Menace" version was much better

I bought this for my 5 year old son for Christmas.  Not only did he think it was great but also his 7 and 9 year old sisters.  There are so many games that there was something for all of them. We took the toy with us to Grandma's and even the older cousins found it very fun and entertaining.
 I really like that they can play all the games in Spanish too.  Once they have got the hang of a game in English they can do it in Spanish and it helps increase their vocabulary.  I was a little nervous if it would be worth the $50 because I had seen the barbie laptops and some others at radio shack. This one seemed like the best choice and was hoping this would be worth it.  In my opinion it is much better than the others we tried in the store and I would definately recommend it

Just purchased this for my 7 year old son that has cerebral palsey- He only has use of his right hand- this cartridge is perfect- game does not allow mistakes and can play this cartridge with only one hand and not both. Since my son has use of only one hand he has trouble playing the other vsmile games- he's hooked. Is very engaging also where some of the other games fall short

This is really fun for adults.  We get together once a month and we really enjoy the company, the food and the spirits.  This was meant for adults to solicize not for children.  I am sure they might learn somehting at another gathering.  I have really enjoyed Bunco.

We have enthusiastically played Candy Land with each of our three kids.  It is easily the best starting point for introducing a child to board games.  Players take turns drawing from a deck and moving their pieces around the board.  The cards have one or two squares of a particular color (such as red, green, yellow, etc.) and players move pieces ahead on the path to the next matching spot of the same color.  No counting or reading is required.  There are also special cards that can move a player ahead or behind, and they are indicated by  picture of the spot on the board to which the player should move their piece.  Play continues until one player reaches the end.

Some of my observations:

1) Most kids can probably start playing and enjoying this game before the recommended 36 months of age.  If you have a child with the attention span and the desire to sit down for a 10-15 minute game, I'm pretty confident they could enjoy it.

2) Among the lessons our kids learned from CandyLand: taking turns, recognizing colors, and dealing with disappointment.   Luckily, the games are quick enough that it is usually possible to play multiple games in one seting.  This makes it possible to keep playing until each child has had at least one win.  (Very helpful for managing little egos)

3) For such a simple game, it manages to perfectly balance the possibility of changes in fortune without seeming arbitrary.  The game is literally in doubt until the last card is played (one of the "special" cards might send a player back to near the start).  This is great for teaching that most valuable of lessons: "NEVER give up".

4) With most simple games, it is almost impossible to get older kids to play after they reach a certin age.  We have not found that to be as true with Candy Land.  We've had games with an adult and kids ages 3, 6, and 9 playing together and having fun.  If you have more than one kid, you know how hard this can be.

As a parent of three, I give this game my highest recommendation

This game has no board therefore no time is wasted trying to move from one room to another to make accusations. The luck in this game depends on which sleuth cards you draw rather than rolls of the dice. Strategy is the same as the original game only game play moves more quickly with one being able to gather information on nearly every turn they have. Sometimes you can actually eliminate more than one item on your list during your turn. All in all, this is a fun game that you can play over and over again in an evening with out getting bored with it

This is an extremely fun and addictive game. You shuffle the cards, and place three (room, weapon, person) in the secret envelope. In every room you go into, you can make accusations. If someone has the card you accused (like the room), then they show it to you and you write it down on your notepad. The game changes constantly, so it never gets boring. The character pieces have teeny details, like Mr. Green has straps and buckles on his briefcase. I gave it 4 stars for education because it teaches you to focus and really THINK. Oh, and good problem-solving skills too. And coordination (you have to add all the clues up to see who did it). All in all, a terrific game. Great for rainy days or playdates. And did I mention the weapons? Very realistic. And cute

This little motorcycle is cute.  However, it's very lightweight and is similar in quality to a ride-on toy that could be purchased for much less at any discount retailer.  The stickers do seem to be of high quality and to date, none have peeled off.  The extreme shipping price added another $10 to the $19.99 price tag.  This is definately not a $30 toy.

I-Dog is so fun to use!  All you have to do is plug the included cable into your digital player's headphone port and I-Dog will play your music through a tiny internal speaker.  I-Dog's face will light up with various patterns and colored lights depending on what type of music you play.  His tail serves as a mute button, but be careful because he doesn't like you touching too often!  I-Dog will get sad if you don't give him any music to listen to.  If you don't have a digital player, you can set I-dog by your boombox or other music device and he can "hear" that way.  There are only two reasons why I didn't give I-Dog 5 stars:  (1) The internal speaker isn't very loud, so you have to have your music player turned up quite high, and (2) the battery cover on I-Dog's back leg is really hard to get off.  You will definitely need some kind of tiny screwdriver to get it off

My 3 year old is very interested in space and LOVES this toy. Having said that one has to make sure that her child plays carefully with it----the payload doors don't really close, the robotic arm is a bit hard to use and the satellite dish on the truck is difficult to put back on. Meets the need for a realistic shuttle, though

This is a must have for your little sweetheart! My daughter carries this purse around with her everywhere that she goes. It's quit interesting finding what she has placed in her purse next ;)The accessories are cute, but she'd rather use stuff from Mommy's purse. ;) The purse is oh so cute too, and durable. My daughter is 21 months old, she received this on Christmas and has been a favorite since.

Purchased the Batman Laptop Computer at Target for Christmas for my grandson who is not quite 5 years old.  He was totally drawn in because it is Batman....but the games kept his interest. The entire family enjoyed trying the different games. Dad, a musician, enjoyed the music game. Graphics are super... I love the way Batman gives his approval with a thumbs up when you get the answer right....and the cool light inside that allows you to adjust from green to red. Grandma played in the dark with grandson for fun even. Worth the $38.99 I paid at Target on sale for sure.

Just wanted to let others know this info that I found out after reading the tip given by the reviewer about getting the table for a lot cheaper at Costco ...

I called Costco and they carried the KIDKRAFT art table with two stools back in January of 2006, and will no longer be carrying it.  You can find it at Walmart for $66 plus shipping, just check the website.  The table is not the same however -- the dimensions are different, the sides of the tables is slightly different (on one side of the Kidcraft table has two cups and a mesh basket in between the two cups, and the other side has a space where little legos can snap onto).  The stools are also tiny compared to the ones that come with this table. Overall it looks a little less substantial, but since I haven't seen it in person, I really can't give my opinion.

Hope that helps someone

I bought this set for my son who loves to draw and paint.  He absolutely loved this set.  The colors are wonderful and the different types of pens, paints and crayons make drawing alot more fun for him.  The case is sturdy and great so he doesn't lose anything.  The price can't be better for everything you get.

It is really expensive for what it is.  I have to say my children love it, esspecially since we can put it in the middle of the table and everyone can take what they need from it.  I love that when we are done you can put everything back and stick it on a shelf.  However, for the supplies you get it IS expensive.  The tote itself is nice but not worth more than $5, add the supplies to it, maybe I could see spending $10.  However, if you catch it on sale I would pick up a few, they make great gifts

I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY 3 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. SHE LOVED IT IN THE STORE AND I THOUGHT IT WAS CUTE. I ALSO AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWERS THAT THERE SHOULD BE INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE STICKERS, BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO BE A GENIOUS TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY GO. I CHOSE TO NOT SHAROEN THE PENCIL BECAUSE SHE IS 3 AND I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS NECESSARY. FOR TWENTY DOLLARS IT IS A GOOD BUY. I KNOW MY DAUGHTER LOVES IT AND IS HAVING A LOT OF FUN WITH IT

Every child should have a chance to play this game at least once in their lifetime. The characters on the game board are so awesome too. Queen Frosting (that was her name... right?) is so pretty, she was always my favorite character. All in all, it's a great game and a great gift for nearly any child

I agree with the other reviewer that this is more like a shape sorter than a kitchen. My daughter loved it when she was 1. Now she's turned 2 and she's lost interest in it, like many other "baby toys". I had to get her a larger and more realistic toy kitchen so she can "cook" with it

This was a great buy from Amazons sale rack at five dollars and 29 cents plus free shipping.  My [...] just loves puzzles and we are certainly fond of Melissa and Doug products.  We normally purchase them from Tuesday Morning or our local hobby store because they are usually cheaper.

This puzzle has made my toddler happy.  He fits it together then dumps it, repeating the process several times a day.  The drawing is realistic and there are no pegs, so it gives a little more grown up feel to the piece.

My 9 year old son just started to understand this game, we bought it when he was 7.  He would get confused on how to call out the other persons ships.  He would say where his ships were.  This game helps kids understand they need to pay attention and coordinate where their ships are.  It depends on how quick your kids pick things up if they would enjoy playing this game.

I thought that this would be toy my daughter would grow into and not be excited about at first.  This was the first toy she opened at Christmas at only 19 months and was not interested in any others for the rest of the week!  She enjoyed collecting the fingers and and "counting" them.  She also has grown in the last few months to putting the puzzle together herself although the fingers might not make it on the correct hand just yet. Very durable, love that it is a traditional wood toy that doesn't have flashing lights or needs batteries! She still loves it months later.  The only downside to any toy like this, is we have to collect the pieces after she has put them in various places around the house.

My 28 month old son got this puzzle for Christmas and loves it.  He put it together the first time out of the box himself. It is the first thing he does every morning and then several times a day.  My almost 5 year old likes it too. It is not as sturdy as the Melissa & Doug floor puzzles, but it still really sturdy.

A lot of people look at this figure and say 'he has no wings!'.While this is true,I still recommend this toy,an excellant hair sculpt and goku's famous 'I have no idea what's going on, but be happy anyway!'look.The wings  are actually  really cool,although the halo has a job staying on.0verall this is a great toy and a definate purchase for any dbz fan or toy collector

We got this as an 11th birthday present for one of my daughter's friends.  It was the hit of the birthday party -- all the girls went home with new yarn belts, and my daughter, who can already knit a little, asked if she could have one, too.  The colors of yarn are bright and the texture is easy to work with.  For our purposes, this was a great birthday present

Bertie is nice.  He has no magnetic pieces so he won't hook to other things.  Nice 16month old tries to use him on the train track which does work but he wasn't really meant for that and can be hard to push on the track

My two year old has several of these cars, and the race track. He loves all things Cars, so these were a big hit. All of the Shake and Go Cars talk before they run, which he especially likes. They are VERY easy for a toddler to operate, but his four year old sister enjoys playing with them, too. They don't run for very long per shake, but that doesn't seem to bother him at all

This board is of excellent quality and is highly transportable, but a little small for Go players who play avidly. The stones are also small, but they get the job done. Why I bought this board was because I wanted to be able to take it with me, without a huge board dragging me down. This fits what I want almost perfectly. Thanks

When my 25 year old daughter sat down to play Wedgits with her younger siblings, she declared that she wanted a set for Christmas.  She thinks it will be a great coffee table game for all her college friends.  My friend got a set for her grandkids but when the family gets together her son and son-in- law monopolize them with their little competitions.  These are wonderful for the imagination, and with Wedgits you will have a toy that adults will enjoy playing with and that makes the children very happy

This was the best therapy game ever.  My girls bought it for me, a gift because I love board games.  We mostly played it with their friends.   I have played with my children several times and found out some very interesting views that they have about me.  I decided to bring it to a family gathering.  I have always been distant with my eight siblings.  The game started out with the kids and my sisters ect.  then when they saw I was ok with laughing at myself they asked the children to leave and just the sisters played.  We had a total awakening of how we see each other.  We have never been closer, since that game our communication has been wonderful.  This game is the best.  We laughed so hard we ached the next day.  We played till 2:00 a.m.  Our husbands kept calling us asking when we were going be home.  We started our game at 9:00 p.m. and told them we'd just be an hour or two. LOL  I have been instructed to bring the game to this Summers get-together

My cousin loves these dolls. She loves that she gets to be a "little mommy" to a boy AND girl...that's what i love about this set...plus the dolls are adorable and the only thing I don't like about them is the hats. I wish the hats were...cuter? I don't know but it doesn't matter. I'd buy these dolls for any really little girl. She used to cry when she lost accessories for her other dolls...but at least with these there isn't much to lose

It seems that just about every house in our subdivision has an electric ride-on toy. There are few "Barbie" Jeeps, few polaris ATVs, one Corvette and three Gators and few others. My 4 year old daughter was the first Gator owner.

I must say, it is expensive.. This thing is by far the most expensive toy my daughter has, bar none. Should you buy your 4 year old $300 ride-on toy? Well... that's up to you.

But she loves her gator. She had to give up on lot of other toys to get this one, but she is extremely happy with it. Sometimes I wish I was 40lbs so I can ride this thing. She can't care less about the "barbie" thing, so this green utility machine was fine with her. 

The gator is slightly faster than others and the fat tires and truck bed makes the gator looks a lot more serious than the Barbie jeep. The truck bed is really useful. Although not recommended, she hauled two kids on the bed. With 4 kids on the car, it still zoomed around the street quite well. One time I loaded nail gun, air compressor, electric drill and jigsaw and panel saw all on the bed and asked my daughter to drive to the other side of the yard to fix the fence. I saw our neighbor hauling few bags of mulch on theirs. It made such a funnt scene.. little electric toys carrying real tools and stuff. Very cute.

Enough of fun stuff. 

Problem 1. Battery location and the hassle to recharge this thing. You have to open the front grill and sometimes the latch can pinch your finger. It hurts.

Problem 2. The left front wheel fell off while my daughter was driving it. I tightened it again and never happened. 

Problem 3. Slipping tires. People complain about the tires having very low friction. They slip very easily on driveway and grass. But this is how it "protects" its gearbox so I don't really care, but I heard they are expensive once they wear out.

I think this is the best ride-on toy on the market today. If extra $[...] won't hurt you too much, then do consider the gator. Your children will not be disappointed.

We got this toy for my son when he was 2 1/2 years old he is now 4 years old. It still runs like new. He drives it like a champ. We have used it to haul mulch to the back yard and some yard bricks. It never fails us and he think he is a big helper which he is. I am thinking of buying a 2nd one for my younger son now.

My son got these blocks when he was 2 for christmas.  he is now 4 and 1/2 and still playing with them.  It seems no matter what new toy he has gotten, every morning I hear him carrying out his bucket of these megabloks.  I only wish they came is a larger quantity.

I ought this for my daughter for her 1st birthday.  She loves the bead maze at the top and she goes round and round the cube exploring all the different sides!  

So as the title would suggest, the stickers on the cog wheels are starting to come off (after 1 week).  This doesnt affect the functionality of the toy, just the aesthetics.  If you are not bothered by some bare cogwheels this is still a great toy!

It stands 2 feet tall to the top of the maze and is the perfect height for little ones.  The other 3 sides are: ABC with pictures rotating blocks, Abacus, Sliding plastic pegs.  The only side with stickers is the cog wheels so no worries about other sides losing stickers.

If they had made the cog wheels out of wood or had the design painted or imprinted into the plastic this toy would be a 10

My son, who is 3, loves dinosaurs and everything green.  This toy was perfect.  The dinosaur comes in Green and Red. I bought green for my son and gave the red one to his cousin.  They have dino wars.  This dinosaur moves, roars, and flashes its eyes red, which looks really cool in the dark.  My son flys it around the room & uses it to attack other toys.  This proved to be a such agreat toy, I bought another (#2) green dino to have my son and husband have dino fights.  This toy is the best I have found.

This toy was bought for my son (14 months) because he has an obsession with the phone.  My son instantly LOVED this toy and has been a great subsitute when he is reaching for the phone and I'm on it.  

It is a great travel toy as well.  Being in the armed forces, we are constantly on the move and he loves sitting in his car seat on the rides and playing with his phone.  

Sure this toy gets a bit old after a bit but it's a small price to pay for your kids true happiness.  My one gripe with this phone is that within two days of him playing with it, he broke the center button that flips the features.  We returned it to the store and have not been able to find it except online.  I'm sure it was just a fluke flaw and am buying it again

My son got this for his 5th birthday and he loves it! He likes to turn off the lights and give "shows" for the family. We have not listened to the Cds yet but I am sure they are a great add-on. My son is fascinated by space adn this porjector was a cool way for him to learn even more. I don't know if they revamped the design or someting but we love it and have no complaints. In fact, we are going to purchase some of the other packs available

This game set it of amazing quality. Every piece has so much detail it just looks good without doing anything! The Dubloons are the best part, and like others have said, make the BEST clinking sound when you drop a pile into your hand.

This game is definately worth buying.... IF you come up with some new rules that make the game more interesting. The gameplay is very uninteresting, boring, and brainless. My wife never passes up an opportunity to tell me how boring it was, and even her younger (12 year old) sister thought it was boring and had more fun playing with the pieces. My wife says I should have bought us Settlers of Catan instead of spending my money on this (before we got our own set... now we have one), but when I bought it I knew it would be just for the game pieces. I am brewing up some good rules to change the gameplay dramatically and make it much more interesting. She likes Settlers so much.. maybe I will get some trade of spices into the game and whatnot.

Anyways, if you are creative and have a good idea for a ship game, then DEFINATELY get this game set. It is high quality and beautiful. But, if you don't have the interest to make your own game, then pass this one up because you would most likely love to play any other game you own before this

The story of "Hansel and Gretel" is more than a warning against children talking to strangers (or trying to eat their houses).  The recurring image of the forest in German fairy tales is a supernatural world where interesting things happen, while the fact the father of Hansel and Gretel is a woodcutter is significant because this was one of the lowliest occupations at that time.  Therefore, what we have here is the triumph of the poor working class characters over the witch and her upper class pretentions (she stores not only treasure but food), which would make her death some sort of proto-Marxist warning if you are ideologically inclined in that direction.

In the original manuscript of the story of the siblings were referred to as Little Brother and Little Sister.  The Brothers Grimm chose Hansel because it was a common name in German fairy tales (their equivalent of John Doe so to speak) and picked Gretel for essentially the same reason (which makes her Jane Doe).  Gretel (or Gretchen) is a form of the name Margaret, which in Latin (Margarita) means "pearl."  

All that background makes it rather ironic that for its Twisted Fairy Tale series McFarlane Toys has turned Gretel into a German princess, striking a pose that suggests "Getting lost in the woods is the least of her worries."  This six-inch figure has tattoos, a spiked collar around her neck, and torn fish net stockings.  There are more details for you to discover when you look over the figure carefully, and while she is not exactly a princess of bondage, Gretel appears to be familiar with the neighborhood.  She also has a mop and a pail, and there is ample reason to think she knows how to use them (the mind reels at the possibilities for rewriting the Grimms tale).

Twisted Fairy Tales is the fourth series of McFarlane's Monsters, and the rest of the menagerie consists of not only Gretel's tag team partner Hansel, but Red Riding Hood, Peter Peter Pumpkin Eater, and Little Miss Muffet.  If you were aware about the probable origins of a lot of the classic fairy tales then you already knew that Mother Goose had a twisted sense of humor.  With these figures McFarlane Toys certainly takes being twisted to the next level.  Even if you do not want the entire set, there should be one of these figures that captures the Jungian dark side of the tales that we were all raised on once upon a time that most appeals to you

The wagon is great, as expected.  5 stars for the wagon, no stars for delivery.  

It arrived with a dent, though, and when we called they told us a replacement wouldn't be available until mid-February, plus we'd have to figure out how to re-pack the thing, which was halfway assembled before we noticed the dent . . . so we gently banged it out and spray-painted the spot, and the recipients probably won't care, but it was a pain-in-the-butt, and there didn't seem any way to deal with it that wouldn't have been too much trouble.

I got a wagon like this when i was really small. Now I am 14 and Istill use it for getting grocries from the store.  It is still in good condition except it is rusty because i used to fill it with water nd make my friends  ride in it.   It is fun to ride down the hill from the store too my home.   It can go really fast and it's easy to steer.   You have to be careful if  you cross the road and go onto a curb with kids in it.  One time my mom was  pulling me and my sister to the store.  When she went over the curb it  tipped over and my sister scraped underneath her nose. It is a great toy  and even though i'm too old for it i still like it a lot

I had a Radio Flyer wagon just like this as a child and loved it,  which is why I wanted one for my daughter.  We bought ours when our daughter was a year old, and she loved being pulled around the neighborhood in it. Now  that she's four, she loves pulling her one-year-old little brother around,  or posing for pictures with him in it. We use it for picnicing in the local  park, or setting up an impromptu lemonade stand on the front lawn. The  wagon seems to keep popping up in our family photos, from the Labor Day  block party to Halloween trick-or-treating. It's a &quot;classic&quot; for  good reason--kids love it, and never stop loving it

My son received this as a christmas gift, and thoroughly enjoys it. This is not a regular DVD. It is designed to go with the "Read With Me DVD" system (a separate remote control that works with it on your TV). A previous reviewer was not aware of this, so it should not have received a bad review for consumer error

 My 2 year old grandson loves balls of any kind,when I found this activity set I knew he would really enjoy it,he plays with it for hours. The only downside of this is that he cannot keep up with the balls. It would be great if this company would give parents,or grandparents an order form to get replacement balls to give this fun toy longer life

I bought this for my son's second Christmas; he was almost 2.  It was a recommendation of one of my parenting magazines and I had to hunt it down 3 years ago. He loved pounding the balls and he even could match the color of the ball to the color of the hole!  He still plays with it and I will be buying his baby brother one when he's big enough

My 5 year old twins really like this game...it is sometimes difficult to balance the toppings, but that is why they like it so much.  On the other hand, my 3 year old finds it very frustrating. If you are considering purchasing this for a younger child you can rough up the pizza part with a piece of sand paper to help with the slippage.

My eight and nine year old sons are big Lego fans. I bought one set for each of my boys and they each built a different model. Both models came out great. The parts fit together beautifully and the finished product moves very well when played with. The vehicles are even better than they look in the pictures on the box. This was the first Technic set that they tried. I hope they enjoy future Technic sets as much

My 23-month old son received this toy for Christmas and it was one of his favorites. He played with it off and on for hours. Woke up this morning and ran right to it. It isn't very educational but the fact that he recognizes the songs from the show makes it more fun. It's not too bulky so it's something we can take in the car. Overall, we love it and would recommend it to any Wiggles fan ;-

I have wanted to buy a Musini for my son for a few years now, but never found one in a retail store, online or local. I recently gave in and bought one gently used on eBay for a fantastic price including the cartridge. My entire family LOVES it, including my 2-year-old son. It was very easy to figure out how to use, even without a manual. On the battery case are very clear, easy to follow instructions on how to calibrate the sensitivity of your Musini. Within minutes we had found the perfect setting for our carpeted living room and we were all dancing. Even my parents who came to visit one night were bopping to the Musini! My dad couldn't keep his feet still, insisting on drumming them on the floor constantly to keep the music going when my toddler had taken a seat to rest for a minute. I have found myself taking it out during my son's nap time to put near me while I do the mundane chores around the house. It is really addicting and keeps us all moving!

I can't say enough good things about this toy. The music quality is absolutely wonderful and is clear and crisp and a joy to listen to. You also tend to feel like you are actually playing an instrument when you're dancing around or even sitting on the floor tapping your fingers. The songs are mostly familiar and well-loved songs that you will instantly recognize. I have also noticed that you can use the Musini to up your child's physical activity. If you change the sensitivity so that they must jump or stomp hard, you suddenly have an even greater outlet for energy and a great source of exercise! You can, of course, adjust the sensitivity so that a single finger tap across the room will register. It's up to you, and I think it's fantastic! Highly recommended

We had a simpler and earlier Quercetti marble run.  This was an upgrade/add-on, and well worth it.  The motorized elevator keeps the action going.  A five year old will need help setting up, but can operate the final run easily.  Safe pieces, easy construction and good directions.  Fun, even for the adults

Gave this to my 6 year old for his birthday.  I helped him to construct it from the clear (no reading) directions along with my 10-year old daughter.  The pieces go together flawlessly - the engineering of the plastic is superb.  The elevator works as designed and the battery pack (2xAA) connects via a short cord - very convenient.  He has already spent many hours playing with it

Our three children, who are now in their forties, were young when we purchased a Bozo Bop Bag for them.  They loved it, used it all the time, and it held up beautifully through the years.   Now our daughter has a daughter of her own and we purchased one for her.  Same design, same wonderful quality, same use as forty years ago.  Bozo is a "friend" who likes to be punched so he can bounce back up.  Our 3 year old grand daughter loves him.  She now has a baby sister 7 months old who will also be able to make use of Bozo.  For toddler activity and appropriate "acting out", I thoroughly recommend this product with no reservation.  It's a bit pricey, but worth 5 stars for sure

Its the best table out there. I did a lot of research and now have a year of "testing." We bought it for my daughter when she was 1, and she's almost 3. I also run a daycare. The chairs don't tip and various ages from 2-5 have put them to their worst. It cleans easily and is easy to put aside, if needed. I did have to replace a chair once (I stood on it.) and the customer service was fast and friendly.

This large collection of lego bricks is to my mind the "classic collection".  Children of all ages (and adults) can build ships, planes, houses -- whatever the mind imagines -- in a variety of colors.  The bricks come in a nice sturdy plastic container for convenient storage.

While Lego has gone on to develop a wide range of other products, for those who want a good starter kit and bricks not specific to any particular image or character, this is a great product

This figure of the great Wayne Gretzky is a must-have for those who collect hockey memorabilia. 

The figurine is life-like, with Gretzky's expression looking just as it did whenever he scored a goal. 

What I love most about this toy is that you can purchase Gretzkys that wore different jerseys to represent the eras in hockey his playing career spanned. If you are like me and collect Gretzky memorabilia (pictures, cards, jerseys, etc), this is an artifact that will fit quite nicely in your collection.

Since I had always wanted a "mad scientist" lab when I was a girl and never got one, my husband purchased this for my 4 1/2 yr old son and I to do together.  Overall, it's been fun.  Everything but water has been included which is a plus.  The "lab" comes with interlocking pieces which can be assembled in a variety of ways.  I like this component because it helps children with problem solving, creativity and motor skills.  The kit also comes with recipie cards and its own measuring spoon and beaker.  It's really taught my son to learn how to measure.  However, the recipie cards tend to generalize and direct you to refer to other recipie cards, which my son would not be able to figure out without my help.  The steps on the cards come with both words and pictures which was a plus but they omitted some details that probably only a grown up would catch.  On the other hand, the "experiments" or recipies go from simple gelatin molds of bugs to more complicated creatures that progressively build upon previous experiments.  They also encourage creativity by giving further suggestions for mixing colors, flavors.  I was also pleasantly surprised at how well the "experiments" actually tasted for a toy kit.  On the other hand, if made as directed we found it difficult to actually fill the monster molds with the amounts directed on the "recipie" cards.  Overall, this was a great gift because it got my son and I to spend some fun time together

I found this hamper storage bin to be great the kids can see into the bins and the bins don't add weight to the unit so the kids can carry the bins easily to pick up toys. However the bins could be a little bigger because they tend to fall off the holding rods if you bump the unit. The hamper is great because my 3 year old son can fill up his hamper but he can't tip it over and spill dirty clothes on the floor but it is light weight and easy for him to help haul to the laundry if he wants to. Good Ite

I looked everywhere for a plastic durable toybox, seems so simple but unfortunately no one kept anything in stock to look at in person. I took a chance on this one because the price was right, and I'm very pleased. I like the pockets on the front, my son loves putting his books in & out. If I would change one thing it is the lid. It is lightweight as to not hurt little hands & fingers (which is good), but is never locked onto the toybox, it lifts off very easily, so sometimes just bumping it causes it to fall out of the shallow indentations it sits in. Other than that we love it

We got this toybox for our daughter when she turned one.  We love that it doesn't have any sharp corners or hinges to get fingers stuck inside.  It still looks like new 6 month later so it is very durable. If your child likes to get inside it like ours does there is no worry about them breaking it since the bottom is fabric.  We also really like the pockets in front for storing smaller items- we always stick her favorite dolls and animals in there.  We don't use the cover so that she can get the toys herself and it works perfect for us.  Highly recommend!

I have been wanted a non-electronic non-paper Sudoku game for some time.  Rubik's Sudoku is a self contained single player game board.  I can move it from room to room without the playing pieces moving from where I have placed them on the board.  There is one extra piece for each number/color tile included.  With the color coding it is easy to learn the strategy behind Sudoku.  I was not picking it up very fast when I tried the paper versions.  After I progress through the 100 puzzles included with this game I'll use the game board and pieces with the Sudoku magazine I have.  For the cost I would recommend this over the more expensive wood versions.  If cost is not an issue then you might go for one of the more durable all wood versions that Amazon has

Anything horse related is a hit in this home. I like the fact that Monopoly, one of my all time favorites, is available now in just about any theme.

My daughter has been riding for about 3 years now and she was so excited to see this Christmas morning.  Of course that was one of the first things she wanted to play.  Her grandma and I played and I was surprised at the amount of things I have learned just from taking her to her lessons!  I'm sure there is a way to alter the game so there are more questions like Trivial Persuit but that was my only problem with the game.  There isn't questions asked every move.  But otherwise, it is an excellent game.  I would definately recommend it

I bought my girls, ages 7 and 4, this product earlier this spring. It was easy to assemble, but finding the right height at which to hang it was a fairly time consuming process.  It has been up for 4 months now and has seen daily use. When our play group meets here, the kids line up to have a turn, over and over again.  I would recommend this for children who are reasonably coordinated and who have enough upper body strength to hold themselves up by their hands.  A very durable product and a fun physical activity

I love light sabers,I got 13 years all if you think you are big for one of them let me tell you that you will be a kid onlly once so get one an play,I bought one of the basic light sabers and they are so cool, this saber is the best, you can fight and the saber will not get damage, i like it very much. I got a green and black and my brother a blue and black so we can fight. The light saber full extended is like 3/4 of a meter but it do his job. The electronic light sabers are to fancy and they get broke in a moment. THE FORCE BE WITH YOU.

Our 2-year-old loves Thomas the Train, so this was a great gift for her. She has other Thomas items, but they're limited to playtime. This, however, is not only good for playtime, but safe enough for her to take to bed with her (she even kicked her Elmo out to make room for Thomas!). It's also small enough for her to be able to take on car rides. A great all around item to have if you've got a child that's really into Thomas

I was a bit afraid after reading the reviews, but this game is a hit with kids all ages. It takes about 3 minutes to set up, but it's not hard and the bees don't fall thru. We played more times than I can count this past week, and everyone enjoyed. I bought it for my 5 year old, but her cousins (ages 19, 17 and 13yo) joined in the fun and actually asked to play. My husband and I also got a kick out of it! Even our 3yo loved it, but she is incredibly lucky and would just pull randomly at leaves and none dropped, she's good!

Our child didn't get bored while we were setting it back up, but everyone was sticking leaves and talking, so I guess it depends on your children's patience or attention span.

In a few words: We all loved it

I chose this railway set over Learning Curve because I believe their prices are inflated, and I was not disappointed with it.  The set is well made overall, with smooth, well-fitting track and sturdy accessories.  My son (3) and daughter (6) have played with the set for hours every day since we got it, both with equal fascination.  It fits perfectly with Thomas accessories we already own.  I have only three small caveats:  1) Buy some "sure track" clips to use on elevated portions of the track.  We use it on a smooth, level surface (hardwood floor), but the clips really enhance the stability for active play.  2)  The round turntable did not spin freely when we got it, because the blue center piece was not perfectly round.  We drilled out the rivet and removed the blue center piece, sanded down the edges, and replaced it.  Now it's very easy for my kids to operate.  3)  The trains included have slightly wobbly wheels, compared to Thomas trains.  But they are functional, and my kids use the trains interchangeably.  It's a great set, and a real bargain

I originally bought this for my husband, an EMT/FF. I wrote a poor review of company, based upon my entire experience w/ this storefront, and the other items I had purchased. I wasn't terribly pleased with the [...] pen but my husband took it to work and loved it. Said it went off several times from pocket while driving..and the entire ER loved it. Overall, it is fun and writes and does what it's supposed to: make you laugh

I appreciate the previous reviews, but we had already gotten the game by the time I read them.  My family - ages 4, 6, 10 and three adults playing  really enjoyed this game. We played until we had a winner (not too long)and then everyone remaining wanted to play to get a second place winner.  Just our opinion - but we had a good time

My daughters (ages 5 and 2 1/2) were given these dolls for Christmas. They love them and play with them every day, especially the 5-year-old. I think the littlest one may be a little too young to really enjoy her fully, but she plays with her when her big sister plays with hers.

I'm glad I didn't let some of the reviews discourage me from getting these. All the problems people are having with the limited English can be very easily remedied, if they read the directions fully. First of all, you must switch the doll from "display" mode, by moving the little switch on her back. The doll comes in the mode used so that people can try her out in the store. In this mode, she will only say one or two things in English. One you move the switch, you just have to "wake her up" and hold the button util she's speaking English. From that point on, she should speak English, even after waking up. However, if you turn her completely off via the back switch, you will have to switch her back to English by holding the bracelet down.

I really have not had a problem, and certainly don't have to spend time interpreting what she's saying. That's why they make directions - it tells about the display mode right on the front

I bought this doll on ebay for my daughter for christmas because it wasnt  available in stores. My daughter who just turned 6 yrs old loves this doll. Doll speaks both english and spanish. The only thing I dont like is that this baby keeps going to sleep after meals, but if your child wants to keep it awake you can press the bracelet or put the bottle in the mouth. Its a good thing if you dont want to run out of batteries soon or to give the doll some rest

This set is perfect for my daughter's new toy oven (miele) that she received for Christmas.  The pots and pans are sized just right and the utensils are fit perfectly with the pots and pans.  One of my utensils already broke apart, but that happens.  I have a 3 year old girl who loves to cook, but she IS 3 and is not always careful.  Not sure whether that utensil wasn't made well enough or it's a 3 year old's play, but the rest of the set seems fine.  I would recommend this and the Miele oven

We got this when my kids turned 3, however could have gotten it when they turned 2. We play it every day. It tells you which player's turn it is, it also counts the number of spaces you are suppose to go with you and then it says "you're on the 'yellow' space" as a double check. There are 2 modes and we can play on the "difficult" mode (the difference being with the easier mode you only have to know colors, with the more difficult mode, you have to know the alphabet). The characters are REALLY cute to. Best of all, EVERYONE is a winner - yeah! A concept that is difficult to teach a 2 or 3 year old, but this games does a superb job. The computer chip knows what space you are on so it makes sure that everyone wins within 2 turns (that I've experienced), so those with little patience can "wait it out"

I bought the bean bag toss as a Christmas gift for my 22 month old son. He had played the Bean Bag Toss the first time at the Halloween carnival at the church. It was all he wanted to play that night. I wanted something that would be easy to pick up at the end of the day. At just three pieces,it is simple to put together and take apart. Although it says it is for 5 and older, it would probably get old fast for a child that age

This is a great game that is made very well.  It is nice and solid wood construction with great bright colors.  It will last us many years.  I bought it for a small carnival style fundraising event that we needed games for children to play.  It will surely be a hit!  My daughter (8 years old) tried it out and really enjoyed playing with it.  It has three bean bags of different weights making the game differing in difficulty.  I would recommend this game to any one looking for entertainment for children.  This game is best played on a table, so that a child can stand and throw the bean bags

MY THREE YEAR OLD SON IS JUST DISCOVERING THOMAS AND FROM READING OTHER REVIEWS AND SPEAKING WITH VETERAN MOTHERS OF THOMAS FANS I REALIZED HOW IMPORTANT COLLECTING THE DIFFERENT CHARACTERS IS IN ORDER TO REENACT THE SCENES FROM THE VIDEOS. THIS SET MADE A NICE ADDITION TO HIS GROWING COLLECTION AND THE PRICE WAS NICE TOO. THE WOODEN TRAINS ARE A BIT EXSPENSIVE BUT ARE WELL WORTH IT IN THE LONG RUN DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY WILL BE PLAYED WITH FOR YEARS TO COME UNLIKE MOST OTHER TOYS THAT CHILDREN OUTGROW OR BECOME BORED WITH ALMOST AS SOON AS THEY RECIEVE THEM

Muffet vs Spider! This is one cool looking figure and since the accessory spider is as big as Muffet makes it a kick butt scene. Again the turn is to the S&M pink & black leather bondage look, similar to the spiked outfit of Red Riding Hood. This is certainly not the image your mind conjures up to the nursery rhyme but it's a great display piece. The downfall from five stars is that when setup, Muffet is almost obscured by the spider. Both pieces look great in detail but a slightly different pose may have improved the figures

I hate spiders (yes I admitt that I make my wife kill them) and so does Miss Muffet...or is she.  As her outfit might suggest, looks like Miss Muffet as a bit of a fetish going on, need I say S&M, and with that said, being pinned (blindly I might add) by this monsterous spider may be more of a turn on then you might think.  You'd expect to see Miss Muffet in a frilly dress and bonnet maybe, blue dress to be exact but with her lether bondage in black and pink this 'Twisted' point of view proves to be anything but expected.  I say kudos to you McFarlane for truly reimagining the fairy tale (nursury rhyme, whatever) and giving us yet another piece of art

After reading other reviews,I, too, purchased this to use to practice agility with our dog.  I wasn't sure it would be large enough.  She is an English Setter.  It works perfectly for this size of dog.  She is approx. 35 lbs, med. size dog.

My son is a huge fan of the Thomas & Friends diecast trains and building sets.  Despite the fact he had amassed a large portion of these toys, an important character was missing from his collection: Terrence the Tractor.  Of course, he was thrilled when this little vehicle showed up in his Easter basket.

No, Terrence is not a train, but one of the tractors that plows the fields on the Island of Sodor.  Terrence is a wonderful character, with his bright orange coat of paint and happy face.  He has one magnet on his back end, perfect for pulling trains (or having trains pull him).  In all honesty, we have not had any problems with Terrence's treads coming off--they are designed to wrap tightly around the wheels when rolling, so no matter how hard my three-year-old tugs on them, they stay put.  Terrence is also a very durable toy--my son has dropped him, stepped on him, ran him into the other trains, and Terrence shows no signs of wear, tear, split wood, or chipped paint.  Finally, Terrence is small enough to fit easily in my son's hands during play, but can also be slipped into a coat pocket during a car trip.

All in all, Terrence is a terrific vehicle, and a perfect addition to a child's Thomas & Friends collection

This large version of Michael Myers is a lot beter than the McFarlane version released ever how many years ago. First the pose is better.Second NO BLOOD STAINS! Don't get me wrong, Michael Myers is a movie killer, but he never got bloody! That was my biggest complaint with the McFarlane version. He does have slight oily looking stains on his coveralls, but if you remember from the movie, he killed a mechanic to get those coveralls. Finally third, and pretty cool, the sound effect is diffrent. Instead of Laurie Strode's whiny help me , you get the Halloween theme playing along with Michael's breathing. Remeber the end of the first movie, after Loomis shot him, but the body was missing, the closing shots were shown with the theme music accompanied by Myers' breathing. If you got the NECA boxed set of Michael Myers and Loomis and liked it, get this! If you got the Mcfarlane version, get this! If you just like Halloween, get this! You won't be disappointed! Looks better in person than on the picture

The fun surprises with all of the magical castle playsets were a hit with my child.  She had a great time using her "magic wands" to see what would happen.  With the bathroom playset, having the vanity doors pop open and a step stool (I assume so Dora could step up to the sink & brush her teeth) pops out was a very fun surprise.  My 7 year old has already spent MANY hours making up princess stories with the castle.  The whole set was a great buy

We have several boxes of these Melissa And Doug bead sets b/c we just can't get enough of them!  My three children (twin boys - one girl) love to sit and make necklaces over and over again!  YES!  My boys love this too!!!  It's a great exercise for their fine motor skills!  The patience they have all developed to sit and string these small beads together is wonderful!  It's great practice for them as they create different patterns with each new necklace.  I suggest getting a few boxes - especially if you have more than one child playing with them at the same time.  Our favorite set includes letters so they can each spell out their own name or other words.

**Not suggested for small children who will mistake them for pieces of candy.

We bought this toy for our 1 year old son.  It is very sturdy and well made and the blocks inside are great.  I agree with the other reviews that the wagon moves to fast on wood floors and it does not turn well.
My biggest compaint, however, is that when both lids are closed, the wagon looks just like a 2-step ladder.  Our son constantly tries to climb it, like stairs.  The other day, he finally stood up on top of the wagon and the wagon tipped straight over onto the handle.  My son fell over with it and crashed on his face.  There are two rubber stoppers on the back of the wagon, but they DO NOT prevent it from falling over.
My son is fine, but this toy is very dangerous and I do not recommend it!

I purchased this from Amazon, having only seen it in photographs.  Based on the online images I expected the top to be opaque pink, and the bottom part to be see-thru pink, so I could see what was inside.  When it arrived the top was indeed the exact color as on Amazon, but the bottom was a pearlized lighter opaque pink.  I don't have any problem with this, in fact I may even like it better, but it was just unexpected.

Overall the case is great.  Just as advertised it will hold 15 dolls in a standing position, with plenty of space in the 2 compartments in the lid for all sorts of shoes and accessories.  The doors on top are difficult to open, and I know I will have to help my 4 year old with it at first, until they "soften" up a bit, but at least they won't be flying open, spewing mini plastic platform shoes everywhere.  As one previous reviewer noted, there is a larger open space in the main compartment that isn't great for holding a lot.  I plan on using either a Ziploc bag in that space to maximize it, or attaching a (pink!?!) piece of cardboard or thin plastic to extend the height of it.  We'll then be able to fit massive amounts of clothes in there!

My cart does say "Barbie" on the lid, but the markings are discrete, and tastefully done.

Overall, I like this cart.  It's probably the best storage device for Barbie that I've seen.  It's cute, fairly well-made and will hold a ton.  I didn't give it 5 stars because of the issue with the interior storage, the handle seems a bit flimsy, the wheels are not great for carpet, and it's a bit pricey

I give this Leap Pad book 3 stars for fun because my children were not interested enough to even look at all the pages.They played with it a lot, but did not get even half way through, maybe that just means it is full of fun stuff to do, but since my kids have not gone back to it, I feel it does not hold their interest quite enough. Educational, 4 stars because some of it seemed a bit simple, like the space page. 5 stars for durability because it is no more and no less durable then regular Leap Pad books. Dont like the eraseable pen though. Must cover it each and every time, even between questions. If it's off more then 5 seconds, it dries out.I peronally did not find it very easy to keep picking up and putting down pens. I tried using a pen in each hand, and it dried out, so I had to keep putting down the regular "pen" to cover up the eraseable pen. Pretty annoying

Easy, straightforward interface (for instance, a button for each number) and navigation through cells.  Easy to tell which numbers start with the puzzle and which ones you entered.  Provides time-penalized hints in any cell.  Pauseable and saves your game between (auto-off) power sessions.  Most importantly, this device lets you make "pencil marks"!  I have checked out at least a dozen products and I have yet to come across an electronic Sudoku that electronically lets me enter dots or Xs to indicate which numbers might (not) be in a cell.  It makes me wonder if the people ordered to design and implement these games actually play Sudoku themselves.  The closest I've seen let you enter multiple numbers in a cell and it blinks through them, which I find cumbersome and patience-trying.  Sadly, this thing doesn't do electronic marks either, but their lower-cost solution involves a dry-erase pen that lets you make the marks right on the screen, on top of little numbers printed in each cell's background.  Losing marks in travel is prevented by the recessed contours of the screen.  Why not 5 stars?  Just the fact that the marks aren't electronic, there's no backlight, and the shadows cast by the dry-erase marks can be a little disorienting.  Otherwise, a well-done, fun, and addictive product

Solid constructed dumptruck.  Only problem is the dumper is higher then the matching loader.  Wish the loader raised higher then the dumper for better play...for my son, not me :

I've been an Amazon customer for years, but this is the first time a product stood out enough for me to write a review. I bought this for my 8 yr. old daughter and I figured my 6 yr. old son could use it later. 

I was very hesitant, because there aren't a lot of reviews and it's expensive.

Well, we've had it a few days and my daughter has been playing more with "Secrets of the Master Magician: An Apprentice's Manual", which I also bought at the same time (another great gift). My daughter is interested in this and it's easy for her to put things together.

My son is obsessed with it! It's similar (for him) to the Lego creatures he puts together. He needs a little help from time to time, but he can certainly follow the very well laid out diagrams. So far they've created an FM radio, a scifi noise maker, a sound detecting space noise maker thingy, a propeller that spins and flies into the air, a seven segment display, a volt meter connected to the solar cell. After connecting the solar cell, I realized my son thought the solar cell would come on like a computer screen or TV! After explaining it and putting my hand over it; now they both know what a solar cell does.

 - There are 5 books of experiments.
 - Each project has a nice simple color picture of how to connect all the components.
 - All components are clearly marked.
 - The diagrams are a top view. Since the connections are layered on top of one another 2 and 3 deep, it takes a little figuring as to what's on top and what's on bottom. It's easy for an adult. It's part of the "puzzle" for the kids. After we put a few together, they both got it.
 - The pieces seem sturdy enough and snap together easily
 - There is great assortment of parts to create lots and lots of very interesting projects.
 - My kids love the projects. I've been very impressed.
 - It has a cable that you can connect to the microphone port of a PC sound card. I haven't played with this. There is software, it looks like you can turn your PC into an oscilloscope. Looks interesting. There's a whole book for these projects. I just saw the cover, so it's likely that there's even more to it.

My kids are learning a lot with this. While they are putting things together, I can explain how these different parts work. There are lots of opportunities to take the project and modify it by replacing parts, change a light out for the speaker, etc.

For example, my son put the 7 segment LED together. I wasn't impressed. I was hoping to put together a counter, but it just connects each segment to ground to turn all the segments on. There are 750 projects, so maybe there is a counter project. Regardless, my son was fascinated. He changed all the connections manually to count from 0 to 9. He changed the main power resistor to see it go brighter with a smaller resistor and dimmer with a bigger resistor. Lots of implicit learning going on. I pointed to the microwave display and said, "See, that's how it works!

I enjoy seeing my twin four year old son's play with the Read with Me DVD program and CD's. The children are learning as they play. I see them recalling information and reviewing parts of the story. This educational toy is very engaging. 

The only problem I have with this toy is sometimes if the child is not on level with the DVD player it takes several tries to get the DVD player to respond to the remote.

If you're not sure if your little one will really be "into" these train sets, this one is a great one to try out.  It's more fun when you get all the extra buildings, but if it's an iffy situation, then I highly recommend this set.  We bought this set for our little one because he just wasn't too sure about these trains.  However, after he received it, he found out that he liked them and well, now we have a bunch of them! The $40 is not much to invest n a toy that they're not going to play with either!  I just wish this set had more things with it besides just the track and the train.  However, you can get a little better deal if you buy the track separately from Maxim, who makes Brio trains now, and the train separately as well.  This train will chew up the batteries pretty quickly unless you use Duracell.  Energizer only makes it two days in this train but Duracell makes it two-and-a-half weeks.  Other than that, highly recommend this toy

I bought this because as a kid my grandparents had one that I would play with constantly everytime I visited, and at the age of 7 was certain I could solve it.  I never did, and eventually it broke, and it wasn't until I was sitting at my work waiting for my computer to do something, that I thought I needed something to do while I waited for my computer to unfreeze, or for the network to come back online.  So I bought a rubiks cube, figured that it was a good portable puzzle thats easy to store, and is only one piece.  It came with a display stand, so I keep it displayed next to my monitor, and have co-workers come by and scramble it hoping that I won't be able to put it back, but I always have.  Like I said its a puzzle, but not with alot of pieces, and its portable, so if your taking the bus home, you can kill time with it, then put it back in your briefcase, or backpack.  I love it and haven't gotten sick of it yet

One day I realized that my baby is now a toddler and his toys are all...well baby toys!  I browsed the toy aisles for the perfect, age apporpriate replacements hating to spend more money on more plastic, yet desperate for anything that will engage him for at least 15 minutes and keep him STILL so I can put clothes away, vacuum, sometimes just SIT and play. This does it!

Reliable duplo/lego quality.  Non frustrating because the pieces actually stay together.  Easy assembly.  Of course my little guy is 22 months so I still have to do the majority of the assembly.  I did get this for him at age 19 months and by now he has caught on as to how to put the track together.  He tries to put the cars together but still needs my help to lock the pieces in place.  

I am constantly amazed at how much toddlers pick up by watching grownups, so keep putting this back together while your little one is present.  Luca does love to disassemble the track and it is a challange keeping it together however, over the last month, persistence has paid off and he has figured out how to re-assenmble his little messes.  The assembly is easy enough for him to get it on his own!  

These chunky toys accomomodate busy little toddler hands  perfectly.  

This particular set comes with everything necessary for your toddler to "get to work".  This set has just enough to busy your toddler without being overwhelming!  This set has satisfied my little guy (although I did buy him the Toby (he is just so cute) set too.  

My older boys take Tae Kwan Do every night and this set is a staple in the karate bag.  It definately keeps the younger .0brothers and sisters busy and off the MATS.

Other add-ons are available but right now, this set, and the Toby have been just enough!

The price sems high for the seemingly few pieces.  I am the first to admit it is difficult to commit to a 25$ purchase, but as with Lego/Duplo products, the quality and play/learning value add greatly to the plastic parts making it an excellent purchase!

GREAT GRANDPARENT GIFT! Even a perfect toy to keep at Grandparents house!

 Our daughter got the pull and spin caterpillar for christmas (she was 9months at the time). At the time she wasn't able to pull it but loved to chase the caterpillar as it was being pulled. Now at 12 months she is able to pull it herself and loves putting just about anything on the back of the caterpillar.

  The toy it self has a very cute face and when pulled the eyes and ears move up and down. 

  The only problem with the caterpillar is the pull string. It is very small and thin allowing it to slip through little hands while trying to pull it.

  Overall a wonderful toy, not only for the balls that come with it but for anything else that your little puts on it

I bought this set for my three children 5,4,2 last Christmas at a fancy toy store.  This product is top of the line and my kids can not get enough of this.  The marble runs are easy to build, sturdy and so much for them to play with.  There are a variety to build with the more advanced sets also we bought a few more "fun" and cool looking marbles as they raced them down.  The kids can change out the different blocks to make the marbles react in different ways- which is a creative aspect.  I LOVE THIS TOY!!!!  My kids beg me to make them a new marble run all the time.  You do need a hard surface to build on, since we didn't have a "train table" we put it on a hard piece of cardboard so it laid flat on the carpet, that way you don't have to hear the clink-clink of the marbles as they hit the bottom..

Everyone in my family is enamored with this fantastic Darth Vader mask. We bought it initially for my son, who is Darth Vader obsessed, but it's quickly become the house favorite. (Even Grandpa can't resist putting this mask on and pretending to be Darth for a spell.) 

On another note: we keep this helmet on our bookshelf in the living room and it makes a great conversation piece. It is so realistic looking and it makes a menacing piece of art on display

I got these for my 28 month old daughter for Valentines Day as she is fascinated by skating. They are a pain to put on, but she doesn't mind. They have "beginner" settings, which she used for the first hour and then it was on to the "expert" setting! What I like is all the safety gear come with them, so she knows that she has to wear it "all or nothing". These are great and seem to be safe and sturdy...with supervision, of course

This toy is pretty durable but if you slammed it really hard on a hard floor it would probally break.If you like craft kits you should deffinatly get this one

All year long, my three and a half year old daughter asked for a digital camera for Christmas.  3-weeks before Christmas, she sat on Santa's lap at the mall and asked for a TRUMPET of all things.  I immediately came home and searched online.  Everyone had the colorful play trumpets that were electronic with diferent characters on them, but none of them looked real!  And I'm pretty sure that my daughter was expecting Santa to bring a real trumpet, so I found this, ordered it and it was here BEFORE the estimated delivery date!

It is extremely lightweight (cannot be used as a weapon), each button has a different tone to it AND it looks real (besides the fact that it's not brass).  She loved it!  She plays it all the time and unbelievably, it's not the most annoying toy she has.  I would recommend it to anyone with young children interested in musical instruments

My 6 yr old loves this game of War. The food chain comes to life in this game of who eats who. Besides the plankton, shrimp, little fish, big fish and Shark, there are also electric eel cards and ink out octopus cards for added excitement. The game is played like war, but the instructions add a slap Jack element. This is not my favorite part. We have limited the slap jack part to just the electric eel card, which still annoys me and makes it difficult for a younger child to play with older children. The ink out card prevents anyone from winning that set of cards and gives the person with less shark cards a chance to win shark cards from the other person. This game can go on and on, don't be afraid to adjust some rules to make this game more enjoyable for your little one and not so complicated. 
The cards are made well.

My children (4 & 6)love this game.  It is great because no reading is necessary.  The game asks the questions and even repeats them when necessary.  While my kids don't know all the topics covered they enjoy the game.  The fact that the game makes sure they move the correct number of spaces is great too.  I definitely recommend this game and I will probably buy the next level of it.

I bought this for my son for Christmas after he saw it advertised in a magazine.  He has been playing with it almost non-stop since then.   It is loud and somewhat intricate but easily masterable by small kids. It also connects with other Matchbox sets and comes with a mat for layout.  Based on my boy's interest and use so far, this rates 5 out of 5

My three kids have loved this tunnel since they were two(they are now 5,7 & 9) They still play with it alot. They do a variety of things with it including magic tricks where the child inside will "magically" disappear. It's great exercise too to be on your hands and knees. They also love to play "tornado" with it, where one child gets inside standing up while the others throw stuffed animals into it, meanwhile the child inside throws them back outlike a real tornado does

This is a great toy for kids of any age. We bought it last year when my daughter was 2 1/2. She still plays with it. It folds up very nicely and no matter how many times her and my 6 year old son jump on the outside, it still looks like new. At my son's 6th birthday party (13 boys, 2 girls), the kids stood with it upright and pretended they were an alien worm, while the other kids beat them with blow up swords. Yes I was supervising, but the tunnel took the beating and is still in great shape. Even out cats crawl through it. There are not many toys that are this much fun and durable

I was skeptical about this one.. as I have learned that the cheaper the toy is.. the less my baby likes it. Though he absolutely adores this floor mat. I got it for him when he was 2 months old. He is only 4 months old now but can't get enough of it. The little octopus does make sound when it spins.. but he can't reach it yet. Though its hilarious to watch him try! He gets so frustrated and beats up the other toys, but then smiles in the end when I go spin it for him. 

I give this 5 stars because the floormat itself is. I would give it 4 stars but that is based on my baby and all babies are different. The only problems we have with it, which would make it 4 stars would be the fact that aside from the octopus there are no other sounds, and there are no lights. My baby loves sounds and lights. So if you have one of those, expect yours not to want to play as long on the mat in the beginning stages. Ours plays for about 20-30 minutes, then he wants to be moved to his swing so he can look in the mirror and hear the music. But you can get really good tummy time on this and it keeps them entertained and laying out straight (instead of scrunched up in a swing so often) so you can get a few things done around the house. 

Oh and we have noticed that our baby will play on it longer, if we go over and play with him every once in awhile. Helping him reach the toys, making the octopus spin, etc. Then we get another 20 minutes to do whatever. So all in all... its a great product...

Just be warned that the little mirror on one of the fish.. isn't a mirror. Its one of those flashy material looking things and the baby can't see his reflection in it.. cause I cant even see mine in it.

If the toys are hanging to low for your baby, you can flip them over the top bar once and they will hang higher, or move the baby on the mat a bit.

I work at a daycare and have an 11 mo old and can promise this is a great toy!  My baby loves it and she usually gets bored with toys fast.  All of the babies like to open and close the door and crawl through.  It also has a doorbell that rings and a light that turns on.  It plays several different songs and really keeps the attention of older children as well as babies.  I highly recommend

My children enjoy this playouse. In the summer I had it in the backyard. In the winter, it lives in the basement. I bough acrylic paints to color the interior.  This will be their surprise when I put it outside in the summer.  It will look like a new playhouse.  Buy this and enjoy playing with your children

We just set up our playhouse and I'm very happy with it! It's large enough for a parent to sit inside, it was easy to set up and my 2.5 year old son is loving his new playhouse! He really likes the basketball hoop/game side of the unit. I wish there were more electronic noises and interactive components on the walls of the playhouse, but I still think it's a great value for the money

Based on the other reviews, this grandmother decided to buy this particular playhouse for my grandson's first birthday present! I am not the least bit disappointed. Colorful, action packed activities everywhere, sturdy, easy to assemble, cold weather friendly and perfect for the little boys in your life! There are a lot of girlie playhouses, but this one is the answer for boys.
My son put it together in about an hour, and was ready for the birthday party guests.
Happy Grandmother

This update of the old Big Wheel style "Green Machine" is made to handle the height, weight and wear and tear of big boys (and girls, up to the latter 30s have even been caught on it), yet the seat is easily adjusted so that the average 5-year-old can reach its pedals.  The main cool feature is the dual lever steering.  Just like with the original hollow model plastic version, pulling on the steering levers in opposite directions sends the machine into a wicked spin-out that kids just can't get enough of.  Yet under the usage of some pretty crazy 6, 9 and 12 year olds on a steep downhill driveway, the machine has almost always remained three wheels on the ground.  

So first, I am amazed at the staying play value of this toy.  For two years now, it has been the first toy out of the garage every time the door opens.  And second, I am amazed at its durability.  The 9 year old who uses it reguarly is an Evel Kneivel who is notorious for breaking my children's toys left and right, and so far, it has held up without a squeak.

This was a million times better value for our hundred spot, than the darn motorized motorcycle we bought a couple years prior for twice that amount which only lasted a year before the gears stripped.  Definitely consider this for your 5-10 year old boy, even if he already has a two-wheeler.  It's a whole different kind of fun.

***** all the way

My 21 month old daughter received Baby Pooh for Christmas and plays with him EVERY day. She loves diapering pooh when her baby brother gets a diaper change, and bathes with him nightly. He comes with a duckie and bottle of his own. The high chair back does not stay attached to the chair, but Pooh still sits upright and has enjoyed many meals with my daughter. Pooh is made from hard plastic and, sadly, his arm broke off when dropped by my husband this weekend. My daugher is handling the trauma OK, but we are getting her an new Pooh for her birthday because she loves him so much. I recommend it

My son received the smartville ice cream shop for his first bday. he played with it all the time. We bought him the rest of the set for christmas. This is definitely his favorite toy. He is 15 months now and he plays with this set almost all day long. This is one of the best things I could have bought for him. He understands how it works by placing the characters on the round spots. I feel it will be a great teaching tool for when he is ready to learn the alphabet and his numbers

this is a great item. Theres alot going on in such a  tiny little space. The detail is great,from the kraken that can make a boat disappear,to the bone cage.There's a collapsing bridge,a collapsing building,a trap door,runaway mill,and a cool magnetic boat race and more.It comes with Jack,Will,Norrington,and the cannibal chief,but no Davy.That was a little disappointing.But anyway its a fun item for all ages.

I bought this high chair for my daughter's second birthday because I love the look of it. The similar chair made by Badger Basket Toys gets terrible reviews for being poorly constructed so I went with this one despite it having no reviews. I couldn't be happier. This high chair is solidly built and was easy to assemble. I love the white finish because it will be relatively neutral as my daughter's room may go through decorative changes in the coming years. I don't forsee her outgrowing this toy for quite a few years and it is sturdy enough to last. She has several dolls, the largest being her 17" Corolle Lila, who fits beautifully in the chair.  I would guess that this chair could possibly handle up to a 20" doll. While it is solidly built, I am obviously discouraging my daughter from sitting in the chair herself (I've caught her trying to several times) because no doll chair should be expected to be that sturdy! The only real negative is the joke of a chair pad. I actually just tossed it because it doesn't really add to the toy's play value anyway and would probably just be a nuisance. I highly recommend this high chair for the child in your life who enjoys taking care of babies. It's made me look to KidKraft for more toys and doll furniture

I purchased this at my 10 year olds request for a birthday present.  I was skeptical, but since it was the only thing requested, I bought it.  We've had it 4 weeks.  What a great pool toy!  Kids love it!  We have a 22 foot above ground pool, and it works fine.  I have bought floats for upwards of $25 dollars, so for the cost of the Wave Cruiser you can't go wrong.  It seems to be well built and sturdy.  I wouldn't hesitate to get on it.  Takes 8 "D" batteries that are in a water tight case.  It will tip over as will any pool float when the rider gets rowdy, but that seems to be part of the fun for the kids.  Overall great gift idea

I bought this for my niece's 5th Birthday, and she loved it! My nephew (8) wouldn't leave her alone, he wanted to ride it. My brother-in-law got on it, and it actually moved him around. It is very durable, thick plastic looks like it will last a while. For the price, if it lasts this summer only, it is worth it

It was impossible to find baby sunglasses in the winter until I found these stunning red infant shades.  A plus was there is a soft strap to keep the sunglasses on.  Our granddaughter looks like a movie star

My daughter recv'd this from her grandmother for her third b/d and i think its alot cuter than in the picture. It has worked fine for my daughter she has figured out how to work it by herself and even has shown mommy how to turn it on once in awhile. she likes playing the cds with her name in them that her grandpa got her for her b/d.  The only thing i did wrong was let my daughter keep it in her room w/o me checking up on her, she went and poured some kind of liquid in the storage compartments so i had to take it away as punishment. I have forgotten about it until i seen this ad which now i think i will get it back out and let her play with it again. I have even played my cds on this while cleaning the kitchen and they sounded fine. My daughter has alot of the princess furniture in her room and this really matched and is very cute, and we have had no problems with this item so far. (knock on wood).

I bought this CD player for my daughter's 5th birthday not expecting it to last a month. To my surprise it's worked wonderfully. She figured out how to operate it pretty easily and she listens to it every night before bed. We've had it for 6 months now with no problems.

My favorite feature is the compartment for the CD's. It keeps them from being left lying around and getting scratched.

DOND is a fun game, and we've had some lively sessions playing it.  There is an additional (we forget...we got rid of it!)...complicated thing that the game had, and made it "less fun" to play.
You also have to disregard the 'suggestion' regarding "how" to give an Banker's Offer...it doesn't work, so you have to use your own judgement, to "jiggle it"...actually, this makes it even More fun!
All-in-all...from 6 to 60, of we whom have played (if you follow the 'disregard' suggestions)...it's a 4-star fun.

As always a pleaser! My girls, ages 9, 8 and 2 have about 8 other sweet streets. They play for hours with them.  I also bought her the  Shopping District and Movie Theater. They got a big kick out of the music the movie theater played.  I would highly recommend Sweet Streets Village gift set and all the other sweet street products!!!!

This is a simple pirate ship tub toy with two backyardigans characters. My pirate enthusiasts (ages 6, 4 and 2) love it. It doesn't move or make noise, but it floats well and is sturdy. The best part is that the characters fit in the bottom of the ship for easy storage

The developers of this game did a great job coming up with questions designed to appeal to kids, questions like: 
 If you could star in a movie, which movie would you choose?
 If you could eat only one food for the rest of your life what would it be?
 The questions range from simple to a bit more complex, so that kids who like challenges as well as those who don't will enjoy the game.
  Another thing: Although you can follow the rules and play this strictly as a board game, we used it while we were just sitting around the table having a casual chat. Sometimes the kids asked the question, sometimes the adults did...but we all learned more about one another...a LOT more...and many of the questions got us talking about family history, memories, etc. Lots of fun! It'd be great to take the questions along on a trip or while eating at a restaurant since they are surefire conversation starters but not so personal that anyone's "personal boundaries" will be invaded. Plus, there are no right or wrong answers and any information provided is strictly voluntary, revealing as much or as little as the respondent wants.  
  One caveat: You will eventually go through all the questions so this game won't last forever...unless you are able to find new people to participate. If so, it be used for years. In terms of fostering family closeness without any threatening or off-limits questions (in short, everyone has to play nicely together) this is great!

I bought this for my daughter for Christmas, three days before her first birthday. She loves taking the pieces out, banging them together and recently, putting them in the correct spaces! The size of the pieces is perfect for a young toddler and the knobs are the right size for her hands. Will definately look at Melissa and Doug puzzles for her again

Imaginext Dinosaurs' T-Rex is quite simply fun to play with. The dinosaur not only is a great toy, with a lever underneath that reacts with the dino biting and yelping out a loud roar. It comes with a catapult with its respective stones (2) that the caveman (also included, with accessories) can operate, to save himself from the deadly bite of the dino.

My 3-year old picked it up since he got it, and he hasn't let go

My little boy is a certified dino-phile, to the point where he's had to teach me to pronounce several dinosaur names (ever tried saying Edmontonsaurus three times fast?). But, like any kid, his favorite remains the T-Rex, tyrant lizard king.

When it comes to his numerous dinosaur toys, this is the most durable by far. Although we've had the same problems getting this to stand at times, as mentioned by another reviewer, that hasn't diminished my son's enjoyment.

To top it off, he's come up with fun new uses for the toy, too. That catapult is VERY good at aiming at our family cat, much to my son's delight

This is a fun toy, just a bit difficult to stack because of the narrow wheels. You can ask which one is biggest, what color is this car, ask about the numbers on the cars, etc... that is why I think it is educational to that respect. My son still has this, and is three years old and will play with it every once in awhile with his matchbox cars stacking them or just rolling them along

I got this for my 2 year old for Christmas. It was a nice present, he enjoys it. 2 things though, it only came with 75 smaller balls so i had to purchase another 100 from somewhere else and the picture is misleading as to how big the item actually is. It could fit 2 toddlers in the pit itself and that would be max, and that is two 2-3 year olds. It is comparable though to other ball pits in size and he seems to enjoy the hoop and putting the ball through the hole in Big Bird's ice cream cone so i feel it was worth the money, especially since i didn't pay for shipping

I got this for the price, $4.99.  I put it together 2 days ago and my 4 year old daughter has spent almost every waking hour playing with it.  The first thing she asks me in the morning: "Will you play Mermadia with me mommy? Pretty Please?"  The parts come off easily but do not fall off.  My daughter is a little rough on her toys but since the pieces of this are easily taken apart and put back together it is great for her.  She loves it.

My [...] really likes this train puzzle. He knows his alphabet and is able to pick out which puzzle piece comes next in line and attach it. It goes straight across and is over 10 feet long. There is also a picture with each letter on the piece and this has helped him with words beginning with that letter. He will say "Q quail" or "N nut" when he is putting the piece on. The pieces are easy to attach, thick and very sturdy. The pieces comes apart with no worry of ripping the picture off. This would make a really nice gift for a 2-4 year old. The box is also very nice to keep the puzzle in.

My 3 year old son LOVES this puzzle and has played with it for over a year.  He likes to put it together over and over again, making a "train" across the floor.  It has really helped him to learn his alphabet, and I highly recommend it!

Deductive reasoning at its best.  Awesome and absolutely brilliant.  I got this for my 8 year old daughter and my hisband and I have taken turns to play with her, and we have been late for dinner many times--- not anting to get up till we finish the game. I recommend it highly for parents who want to spend some quality time with their kids

Yasmin, one of the super-stylin' Bratz Rock Angelz, is in my possession! So, I'm sorry my reviews go in to EVERY LITTLE DETAIL(as one customer complained), but that's how I do it! So if you haven't bought a ticket to info-town, either get the heck outta here, or buy one by reading this review. HERE GOES!

First off, Yasmin has blonde streaks flowing through her dark chestnut hair. Just like the other Rock Angelz(Cloe, Jade, Sasha), Yasmin's hair is awesome quality;smooth, great duraility, etc. That feature makes her great for younger kids because her hair can get messed up many times, then smoothen out. Yasmin has the liveliest color eyes of the Rock Angelz; emerald green. This works as both a strikingly gorgeous feature and hot highlight to the doll. Her lip color, pink, really stands out on the doll. And of course, as most other Yasmin's do, she has the warm cocoa skin color. She has dark blush and sparkles above her eyes.I absolutely adore her chocker. It is too cute! I'd definately say that her jacket has a 70's-80's rocker look to it. It's definately the best piece of clothing on this doll. Just beware that it's difficult to fasten the velcro in the back. The velcro on my Yasmin doll's jacket is practically coming off! Underneath her jacket, Yasmin sports an undershirt labled 'Rock Angelz', with the ever-so-famous red glitter included. Her jeans have no rips or anything. They're just jeans with white stitching, red glitter, a chain half-belt, and little frayed bits at the hem. Now don't get the wrong idea! Just because this doll has a chain, leather, frays, and a belly-jewel(so not a tatoo!), don't go thinking, "Oh no! This doll portrays an image of bad things for our 'little' girls!" She's just a cute rock star singing inspiring songs and wearing totally appropiate clothing. Now, of course, if you still think this doll is innappropiate, it's not my place to order you to buty this doll. I just wanted to epress my opinion;this doll is safe. Anyway, her black guitar is in the same mold as Cloe's red one and Oriana's purplish one. It's a little difficult to position her guitar correctly, but not thouroughly impossible. Her second outfit consists of sparkly mini and rockin concert tee. Yasmin's ankle boots match with both outfits. And I love the fact that both outfits are mix-n-matchable! It rocks! Literally! Her accessories include:glasses, 2 sets of earrings, cell-phone-necklace, bracelets, star brush, lipstick, microphone/microphone stand, and totally-collectible displaying stand!

You've outta have a rockin' time with this rockin doll! She's 100% worth the price($19.99)! Fortunately, I got her for Christmas. In my opinion, she's appropiate and meets the standards of ALL ages(notice I stressed on the 'all'). You're lucky if you get her! GREAT JOB MGAE!

Chelsea&Yasmin(50% My Scene, 50% Bratz)over, & OUT!!!!!

P.S.-END THE WAR!!!

This set was one of the most fun builds I've done with Lego in a long time. As an adult fan of Lego, I highly recommend this set for its minifigures and part selection. They are excellent additions to any castle or general builder. As a builder, the final construction is impressive in size (18+ inches long), functionality (the rotisserie chicken is quite amusing), and playability (the sea serpent's posability and the incredible catapult alone are stunning). The catapult was my favorite part. After seeing the necrotic firing action of the Lego Exo-force Mobile Defense Tank's disk launcher; the rapid-fire, long-range Viking catapult is astonishingly fun to play with. The lone drawback in this set is the fragility of the ship's hull. It should be assembled on a hard surface (I tried to build it on carpet) and slid about on the floor, not carried (it will fold in half in the air). A few extra plate elements to reinforce the hull joints would probably improve this set

Our daughter received this puzzle for her 3rd birthday.  She's a puzzle nut!  This became an instant favorite and had to be left together for all to see.  The picture sheet in it labels all the sea creatures and it becomes a great way to discuss the different levels of life in the ocean.  The coloring is beautiful - Mom and Dad enjoy it as well.  It is extrememly well built, sturdy and can really be wiped off with a damp cloth.

The only negative, as another viewer pointed out, is the darker bottom pictures.  Harder for young ones to distinguish designs and not as visually appealing.

I bought this set for my son prior to reading the other reviews online but before I tried to set it up. I will admit in reading the reviews about how difficult some people thought it was to put together that they must be exaggerating...we'll apparently they were not.  I tried for 10 minutes and was covered in soap and nearly hurt myself trying to get the first two pieces together...so at that point I gave up and waited for my husbands help. The two of us spent nearly an hour banging the thing together with every tool we had(after we washed off all the soap b/c that just made getting the pieces to stay together impossible)and once we had the center base up I pushed it and it fell completely apart.  We got it back together but there was no way I felt it was sturdy enought to let my child anywhere near it.  So in desperation I called the ToysRUs store where I got it and spoke w/ the store manager. She assured me that this was not how it was supposed to be and that I should bring it back.  I wasnt thrilled about that b/c it wasnt the easiest thing to get home in the first place...but what choice did I have. I asked her if they would set the next one up for me to make sure it worked b/c I wasn't about to go through this again.  When I arrived at the store it was all set up and completely sturdy...exactly what I had wanted it to be when I had purchased it. Unfortunatly due to its size we had to take it back apart to get it home but once we did my husband had it back together in about 10-15 minutes with just a little banging from a rubber mallett...just like some of the other reviewers had said.  So the morale of the story is...if its miserable to put together then its probably defective and should go back...but once its together properly its great....now if my son would just show some interest in the darn thing all would be good with the world!

My 3 year old son received this as a Christmas gift last year and he loves it.  He explores outside and collects things from the yard and hauls them around in the truck.  Must say the truck is durable, it stays out on the deck and the weather doesn't effect it.  We hose it down to clean it, no issues there.  Highly recommend

Our family loves this game.  It brings out the creative side of people of all ages and is very fun to play.  There are 5 catigories.  Movies, weird laws, initials, word meaning, dealers choice.  Everyone takes a turn orchestrating the game while the rest of the players make up ficticious answers.   Then that same person reads everyones made up answers along with the correct answer and you have to guess which is made up and which is the correct.  We played many times over Christmas with teenagers and gramdma too!  Everyone was having such a great time we didn't want the game to be over.  Turn off the TV, make some popcorn and re-connect with your family with this fun, no pressure to win game

Playing Balderdash is a family tradition after Thanksgiving & Christmas dinners and everything in-between.  Anytime there is a family gathering the Balderdash game comes out!  My grown sons and their wives are full of bull, the grandkids are now joining in, but, it's tough to out bull the mother of bulls!  Gotta Love It!  Jan

This lovely new set depicts one of America's best-loved and most popular breeds.  

The beautiful dun mare with her sparkling white blanket was created using the "Duchess" mold.  Her alert expression and slightly wind-tossed mane is sure to make her a favorite with your young horse-lover.

The sweet dark dun foal has his mama's lovely blanket and sweet face.  Created from the classic arabian foal mold, his thin legs make him a bit more fragile than mother.  

All in all, these two would make a wonderful addition to any little equestrian's collection

This is the best value I've seen for a dinosaur set. My sons love it, and several of my friends have gotten it for their own children after they've seen the kids playing with ours. The volcanoes, rocks and mat are a real plus, and the dinosaurs are big enough to be fun for the kids. They play with this set A LOT

My son has been using this table for the last 3 months and absolutely loves it.  He also has the LeapFrog table, but gets bored with just one.  This table is on the opposite side of our (toy-filled) living room, and he will go over to this for a change of pace.  He loves Elmo and likes to hang on to his head and also mouth it.  He likes to use the phone, which he also mouths - just assume he puts his mouth on everything :) - and also the little bowl under Cookie Monster.  So why four stars and not five?  I do wish the base had a bit more weight to it, but he can easily pull up on it without getting the whole toy over although we've had a couple of near tips.  Also, the toy is a little less educational than I feel it could be since he is always accidentally setting off buttons with his arm...so he could be pressing the triangle with his finger, but his arm could press the Pig...and off Elmo goes oinking and singing about pigs.  Still a great toy, with lots of entertainment value, and as he matures we have less accidental set-offs.  I bought it on sale and it was worth the money

My son got this toy for his first birthday. He's now 18 months and still loves it! When he first got it, he immediately began to dance to the music. You can press certain body parts on Ernie and then he sings about them (i.e. eyes, mouth, ears).My son can now identify his ears, mouth and eyes on himself. Great toy

My son is a college student in Boston and excitedly brought this board game home on one of his breaks. "You've GOT to play this game!" he said. It had been years since anyone could even so much as coax me over to a table where a board game was being played. But I wanted to spend time with my son so I consented to learn it. Turns out, it was amazing! My husband, 13-year-old son, the bringer-of-this-new-addiction and myself must have played it 20 times in the 3 weeks he was home. The "board" is different every time you play it so nothing is predictable, rolls of the die dictate one's success, trading and strategies can get intense and the more you play it, the more you definitely like it. Alas! I've "settled" into Catan mode and no longer need to beg him to bring it home from school.  I bought my own house copy plus the expansion so we can get visitors hooked on it, too. We play it all the time. Cross my heart, this is fun. As my son said, "You've GOT to play this game!"

This is a great puzzle!  My son is 2 1/2 and wants to put it together almost every day!  It is amazing to watch him, because every time we sit down on the kitchen floor to do this together he can do it more and more on his own!  And when we are done he is so proud of himself, I love it!  I am online right now looking for more just like it

I read some of the reviews posted on this site before I bought this Doll, I saw it on Ebay but was afaird because of some the comments that was posted about the doll and thought I should buy it directly in case I needed to  return it, But I had no problems at all other then the UBC cord the direction said to turn the cord one way when actually it is the other way, other then that I had no problem downloading anything and I can't wait to give this to my daughter for Easter

My almost 5 year old daughter loves this toy.  It is easy for her to control.  My 8 year old thinks it is boring.  
I don't think it has any educational value.
The controller has a long pointed antenna with a plastic rounded end, so the kids have to be careful not to poke each other with it.

 Well the space is limated but I learned how to deal with it. The set comes with four parts rainforestchamber, bug chamber, aquarium , and ant colony. The aquarium comes with triop eggs or you can put a goldfish in. then we have ant colony which the air holes are a bit to big. Finally we have rain and bug chamber which to me are the best of all the four. the rain forest chamber can hold a small lizard or frog but since I bought this during winter I will have to wait till spring to catch a lizard. And we all know what you put in a bug chamber. Over all I rate this four stars due to small space. P.s there a bug catcher in it as well

This is a great house,got it at toysrus,has six ring tones at doorbell,dog,knock knock,jibberish,fog horn,etc.,it's so easy to assemble.all you need is a helper(to enjoy assembly)and a power or ratchet screwdriver(you need both)the stove is a little tricky to start but once you start the hole you can use a power drill!your child will love it.Swinging door/window,spongebob chair fits inside(you can probably get a big screen TV in there!)Great for the price $129.0

I purchased this house for my in home day care. So we have lots of toddlers playing with it! They love it! The only complaint I have is that the door falls off easily if the child pushes it instead of pulls it. But the kids all fit in there and even bring chairs. Even the one year old loves it! He likes to play peek a boo with the shutters. Lots of fun and well worth the money

This playset is great - my son loves it.  You do have to be careful with the open sides - it is very easy to fall off.  My only complaint was puting it together.  The instructions are horrible and have no words - only pictures.  The parts are hard to tell apart (the color-coded bolt caps all look the same in the instructions) and the pieces are hard to handle.  Give yourself extra time to work through the instructions and get a couple of friends to help.  Also, a power screwdriver should be a required tool to get the screws into the plastic

This is a single player game.  Set up the cars according to the diagram and try to get the ice cream truck out of traffic.  The puzzles start easy and progress slowly so that kids learn the maneuvering tricks without getting frustrated.  By the end, the puzzles are a challenging even for adults who have not played before.  Both kids love it- ages 4 and 9.  We helped the four-year-old learn the tricks by just asking "Whoes in that cars way?" Then "whoes in the trucks way?" until she reached the car that could be moved and work her way backwards

Not only is the 90's Game fun and enjoyable to play, but the questions and answers bring back lasting memories of movies, sports, TV shows and meaningful events from the decade.  Correctly answering questions by relating them to personal memories and experiences allows all players to relive their experiences from the 90's.  Whether you were a student, young adult or parent during the 90's, this game is sure to invoke sentimental feelings.  I highly recommend it for groups of friends and families

My 15 month old has been playing with this for a few months and really likes it.  He plays with it just about everyday.  Everytime we have kids come over to visit it seems to be a big hit too.  They all love trying to make baskets.  
The flaws are that it is loud and I wish the baseball and football did more or made noise.  They don't get played with as much as the basketball part since it sings and makes crowd noises. 
Overall it's great as long as it keeps the kids entertained!

My son loves this toy.  It is the perfect height for my 14 month old (he got it when he was 12 months, and it was great then, too).  He can play with it sitting or standing.  He loves to make baskets, and I can teach him numbers as the scoreboard keeps his score.  He loves to spin the football, and he is starting to gain enough coordination to hit the ball with the bat.  He uses the bat it came with to hit other balls around the house.  This toy is a family favorite

Amazon[.com] recommended this game for me, based on the fact that I love the game Set.  Unfortunately Xactika bears a strong resemblance to "10 to 1," a game played with a normal deck of cards.  If you already know how to play "10 to 1," Xactika may seem derivative.  After trying Xactika once or twice, we threw it in the drawer and just played "10 to 1" instead

Bought this for my boy who just turned 11. Let's just say that he totally loved it and it was the first present he played with. Two blinking lights on weapon. One light on helmet which makes the eyes glow. A little pricier than other Bionicles but worth it. Not too hard to put together, just make sure you put all of the tiny pieces in a bowl or some such thing so you don't lose them while assembling the guy. The folks at LEGO are geniuses, sure it's a franchise, but they're doing a great job keeping it interesting

I can't put it any better than the others before me have.  I did a lot of research before purchasing this train and am so glad I decided to spend a little bit more money for a TON more quality.  This is truly an heirloom train set that will be around longer than I will be (and I'm only 35).  

The other reviewers are also correct in advising that you shop around before purchasing this train set.  The prices vary wildly.

Yes, it hurts a little to spend this kind of money on a train set when you know there are others out there.  However, the others are cheaper for a reason... they're junk.  You simply can't do better than this set

I bought this game for my mom for christmas and we played it...right now it is in my game closet because I introduced this game to my poker friends and now we have "PIT" night instead of poker night. We can not stop laughing when we play this game. We bring this to all get-togethers and everyone loves it.I had to buy my mom a new PIT game because I take it all the time. This game is soooo much fun, the more people you play with the more fun it is!!! GET THIS GAME!!

My girls love the sandbox!  The only thing my husband and I don't like is that you cannot move it once the sand is in it.  We thought we'd be able to, but the walls are just flimsy enough that you can't.  Otherwise, a great purchase

I bought this sand box for my son's 1st birthday. He has had the sand box for a month and loves it. It looks really nice in our yard and the top has kept out rain and bugs. I was going to go with a cheaper sand box, but now i'm glad i spent the money. This is a very good product!

This game is so much fun!!! I do think that maybe it could use a few more games or maybe make different difficulty levels. In other words... If you are a huge Star Wars fan like me, then you will love this game!!! It will keep you occupied for at least an hour a day if you are determined to beat a certain level. Another thing I think it could use is maybe a game-save function or something... Anyway, GREAT GAMING EXPERIENCE!!! One and a half thumbs up!!!

This is an excellent gaming system containing five acrade classics, Ms. Pac Man, which plays as close to the arcade as you can get, Pole Position, which the Joystick turns as a stearing wheel, again close to acrade action, Mappy, where you are a mouse trying to get a cat on the loose in a museum (much like original mario brothers), Galaga-an updated space invaders type game with more difficult ships to hit, and finally Xevious, where you are commander of a ship blowing up attaching enemies over land and see (plays like Tiger Heli for nintendo, or other games like this).  I use this on my old call room tv with mono av jacks available, works great, passes the time with family friendly games. These games are much better than some of the new expensive games.  check this out, you will be pleasently surprised, and for around 6-12 dollars, good deal. Runs on 4 AA batteries, then plug and play

Someone gave these to us when my son was 9 months old. He loved holding them and it has been fun watching him learn to "color" and develop his hand-eye coordination. He is now 22 months old and we've just used them up and I had to buy the Crayola tub crayons because I couldn't find these at Toys R Us. The Crayola crayons are thinner (which doesn't hold up as well to toddler abuse) and have more colors, but I like these better because they come with the ducky sponge to wash the crayon off the walls (my son loves that part, too). These crayons are a surefire way to get my son into the bathtub

The nephews loved it.  We sent it to them along with other gifts for Christmas.  Turns out the twin 8 year olds found this to be their favorite gift.  The light up part was pretty cool but they did have some trouble bouncing the ball.  When the lights went out the fun really happened.  Everything went well even when it turned into tackle-basketball.  Not their mom's favorite sport but no harm... no foul.

This Eeyore is so much fun.  I gave it a 4 because the little butterfly is too easy to lose, but if Mom and Dad are diligent to keep the part with the toy and teach Baby to keep them together, I think there is also something to be learned with this, plus the fact that he is so DARN cute and the little voice is sweet and soothing. "GOOD NIGHT BABY."  Just precious.  Baby quickly learns that Eeyore only works with the butterfly rattle.  I thought the ears would be easy to break, but they have taken a lickin' from my grandson and still work.    Nana Ka

My 2 year old daughter (and our 4 & 6 year old neighbors) LOVE this toy!  I had it up during my daughter's second birthday party and all the kids loved it!  It holds up very well and I have only had to refill it once (and that was only because one of the kids managed to pull out the plug).  Some of the balls are not 100% inflated but they still roll just fine and my daughter has the best time with this.  It is up in the living room and not outside so that keeps it from getting any other holes.  I would recommend this for any kids around 4 or under.  The one thing to keep in mind; the kids may be afraid of it at first; my daughter was terrified of it the first day but by the second she loved it and now she spends a lot of time in there

Sooo cute.  Santa gave my 7 y.o. daughter the dog and cat versions of this game.  She and I have already spent several hours playing with her "pets".  Unlike the earlier pets, there is more to do than just care for your pet.  There are games, activities and interactions with pet friends.  There is a whole village of homes and places to visit.  

You collect stickers throughout your adventures.  For instance there are 29 stickers available for making friends.  It is represented by a heart sticker.  Everytime you collect a sticker, you are taken to your sticker book and it indicates how many stickers are available and how many you have obtained.  

There are three exterior buttons for use to play with, groom and feed your pet.  When your pet ignores you, it means it is time for grooming, playing or eating.  

Sometimes your pet will suddenly disappear and then reappear at their potty mat having left a little undesirable.  My daughter thinks that is hilarious.  Kids!  

The only drawback is that the screen does not light up for play while travelling after dark.  Maybe they'll improve upon that in the next versions

My 2yr old got this one and another Imaginext Dinosaur for Christmas and this one is by far his favorite. He loves attaching the cart to the Mammoth and moving them around. 

The reason why I give 4 stars instead of 5 is because the button to push down on to make the noise is not real easy. When you think it's pushed down all the way, you have to push a little harder to get it to make noise. Also, like the last reviewer I think the wooly hair is going to attract dirt and not stay very clean. But overall the toy is fun and very durable

These coins are nice and heavy... they have a good feeling when you hold them or keep them in the pouch.  My son uses them like Jack Sparrow does in the movie so he doesn't die in our play battles.  However, they seemed rather expensive after buying them and having them shipped.  It would be cheaper to use silver dollars or other real US currency that is large and heavy

My 6 & 8 year olds sons received this toy for Christmas. They are HUGE Pokemon fans so just the fact that it has Pokemon pictures on it made the toy worth it. Fortunately, it also happens to be fun to play. 2 to 4 players try to allow the fewest balls possible past their own paddles. The fewest points wins. Each player has their own scorekeeper for up to 5 games. Setting up the game after every round gets a little tedious, however it's not so bad if everyone helps. The 2 best things for me are that I don't mind playing (unlike the actual Pokemon cards which are a boring nightmare for me!) and it doesn't require batteries!! My 3 year old daughter likes to play too although she loses every time. We just don't tell her.
If your kids like Pokemon, this is a good toy

My 4 year old son loves all things Rescue Hero!  His grandparents got the MACC for him almost a year ago now.  I run an in home day care,so I watch not only my son but 2 other 5 year old boys and my youngest son, 13 mo and a 10 mo old boy!  They all love it!  This thing has stood up to all of their adventures! One of the kids I watch was thrilled when he got the same MACC for his birthday from his parents!  He had just went on and on about it, and they couldn't resist.  It is very large, but we already had the firetruck, police car, helecoptor and about 30 rescue heroes, so,in the words of my son, we just HAD to get this too!  I highly recommend this toy for all ages!  Great imaginary play

This toy was an instant success with my son, who is six. He figured out how to put together the track in minutes. Unlike other construction toys, Skyrail is not limited to one or two designs. My son can create endless configurations, including loop-the-loops that really work. This toy is also easy to disassemble. The track and connectors seem a little flimsy, but so far -- after many, many uses -- none of the pieces has broken

When I was a little girl I stood along beside the table and watched the adults play. This was how I learned how to play the game. I have now been playing rook for about eight years and loved the style of cards shown above (90's style). Unfortunately, they have changed the style of the cards on us and I would like to purchase the 90's style. If any come availible to purchase please be sure to email me and inform me of this so that I can buy some. I really dislike the new style of cards and all of my friends and family agree with me

We bought our youngest son the pirate ship seven years ago when he was four. He is now eleven, and is asking for this new updated ship. He has played with the old one for years, outside in the pool, inside, along with the big king castle, and countless other sets that we have. Yes, Playmobil. is delicate, and young children can be taught how to play with it, there are alot of small pieces, but like Lego, it will and does encourage a child's imagination, rather than stifle it.  We have Castles, western forts, city sets, boats, all of it! It does take time to put together, but some of the best memories are of me and my boys putting together some of these intricate playmobil sets the day after Christmas! When you buy toys for your kids, don't look at a toy and say "what does it do", rather look at a toy and ask "what can my child do with this toy"? Playmobil has been one of the toys that my three boys have stayed with along with legos well past Christmas, much more, than anything else. I am keeping all of our collections for our grandchildren.

I purchased this pirate ship for my son's fourth birthday. This is by far the most popular toy in our house! My 8 year old son and 6 year old daughter also love this toy. There are so many items that come with the ship - from canon balls, swords, treasure chest full of goodies, food, animals and even jewelery for the pirates - they are never bored. My four year old plays on his own, or with his friends, and when all three are home they all play together. Definitely worth the investment for the amount of joy this toy has brought to our home!

My 6-year-old got this for Christmas and he and his 4-year-old brother love it!  They enjoy doing the battles and coming up with different monster combinations.  It teaches strategy since they have to figure out which combinations work best.  My kids also like to just play with the figures by themselves like action figures.  A piece of advice though:  This game only comes with 2 figures so you really must buy additional figures or it won't be much fun since the point is to create varying combinations.  Therein lies the problem - or at least MY problem!  I can't find the extra figures for this thing!  Luckily, they were available around Christmas so I got some then, but now I can't find them in stock anywhere.  Also, I have not had any durability problems although I had some sound quality problems on the 2nd day.  Fortunately, it turned out that all I needed was new batteries. You really need alkalines for this game.  Overall, it's what my boys think though and they ADORE this!!!

There are always problems with an any type of bed, even an inflatable one. I am actually 21, but I don't have a credit card so I had to use the kid review instead.
This bed is great. Of course there are problems, but they don't outweigh the good that the bed has. It is great to sleep on, you can carry it on trips, you can have it on another bed that is in one place, or on the floor. I do admit, it is somewhat hard to set up, but it is worth the effort, for the sleep is unparralleled. I sleep on it every night and I have had no problems with it at all. I recomend this bed to be for ages 5 to adult because of the gap it has between the side and the mattress. What is the most important thing of all is this: Is the person you bought it for happy with it

we love the accessories this item comes with but the doll itself is... we have mixed feelings about her.  my daughter, 4, loves her hair because it's so different from all her other barbies, but she hates her feet.  her feet are way too big, even bigger than ken's (my daughter tried making her wear ken's shoes but it didn't work).  another thing we love and hate about her is that her hands can move like pregnant midge (good), and she has a bigger body than most barbie dolls (bad because she can't use the other doll's clothes)

I originally bought this monkey on vacation.  I showed it to my son and he grabbed it and hugged it.  How could I not buy it for him doing that?  It was so soft and cuddly and the feet are like beany babies.  I eventually ordered a 2nd one from Amazon for my parents house.  So now I don't have to drag it from house to house.  As he gets older, he is liking it more and more

I got this for my 15 month son. HE REALLY LOVES IT! He doesn't use it as a ride-on yet (more fun will await!), but he pushes the car from the back handle everywhere inside & out. there are alot of buttons which make sounds and some have the car talk back. The "oil change" sounds are his fav. HE also enjoys the toy phone(when you put it in the slot it rings and the car answers!) There is also a small storage section under the seat.. The only thing I wish it did have was a horn sound instead of one of the many car's sayings. For the price it is a great interactive toy!! And for a boy who usually is not big on his toys for very long, this still captures his attention months afterward!.oh, and this toy can take a beating! No complaints whatsoever! A great find

I bought this for my children's room which has an outer space theme.  The planets are nicely done and look great.  No, they don't glow in the dark all night long... but who wants their kids room lit up all night anyways?!?!  They certainly glow long enough for both of my boys to fall asleep!  We have a round ceiling light which I put triangular "rays" around which is now our SUN.  
I'm giving this 4 stars ONLY because I agree about the sticker stars... yeah... they kinda stink.  BUT, the plastic glow-in-the-dark stars are easy to find (I've even seen them in pharmacy's) and inexpensive.  We put up 2 packages of the plastic ones and added the sticker stars from the package.  It gives the effect of stars which are closer and farther away!!

This is the ultimate in home laser tag fun.  It has great range and accuracy for hours of exciting but harmless fun.  Get your kids away from the TV games and into the real (figuratively speaking) thing.

If you have, two kids make sure you but at least 4 guns.  Once you receive them, you'll experience the need for the two extra guns.  Everyone who sees them will want to play.

Great toy, thanks Amazon.

I just got the Laser Tag Master Blaster a few days ago and I love it.

I've had my eye on it ever since I got the Deluxe for my B-day back in September. I was looking on Amazon so frequently for the price to drop that I got tired of watching so I stopped for a few months. 

Then spring came and I got into playing laser tag again with my little brother. I was suddenly filled with an urge to buy the LTMB. I looked back on Amazon and...BOOM! 60 percent off! 20 BUCKS! 

I told my mom and dad about it and they said that I could get one. So the next day we began the ordering process on Amazon, through Toys R Us. We checked the shipping charges and...BAM! 15 greens! 

So we just figured on our next trip into town we could just go to Toys R Us and see if it would be the same price. It was (minus the 15 bones for s&h). So we picked up a few and went home. 

After reading the instructions a million times and doing a few tests I finally figured out how they work. I also found out that they are very much like the Deluxe, except for the shoulder stock, the sights, the fully automatic feature, the 3 shot burst, the shot range, the text messages, and who could ever forget the rocket. 

Let me explain the Laser Tag Master Blaster to you: This large tagger is much better for a very large playing field. The Deluxe and the IRT-2X models are better for smaller areas. 

The LTMB's laser has a shot range of up to one thousand feet. The laser has three different shot types: the single (fire one shot), the 3-burst (fire a burst of 3 shots, no overheatage), and the fully automatic (fire non-stop). 

You can also send text messages (up to 10 characters long) to your teammates and opponents. Retreat...Behind You...Gotcha...Ouch!

The rocket is awesome. Just load, pump, and launch, simple as that. With just twenty pumps the rocket can sail over forty feet, blasting everyone in a 15 to 20 foot radius.

There is a lot more to the LTMB but it would take to long to type, so you'll just have to figure it out for yourself.

This product was highly recommended by a school teacher in the UK as a great teaching tool.  It was well received as a gift by the children and their parents. An excellent math teaching tool that the children love.  It is portable, user friendly and has something for those on many different levels, so much so that one father, an engineer, loves to play the game by himself when travelling and is equally enjoyable to his 7 year old son, as well as a game that they can play together.  Math Whiz is a tool that creates a friendly math experience which can be used for many years as the upgrading levels will remain a challenge

I bought this for my nephew's first birthday and my sister told me that he loves it.  When he gets up from a sleep it is the first thing he wants to play with and with him being at the stage where he is trying to stand up; it is a great motivator to encourage him to stand.  Your kids will love this toy and the sounds and lights will keep your child amused for hours

...and they are working out great with our Thomas Layouts.  Melissa & Doug products continue to impress me with their high quality and typically provide great educational value.  These are educational and your children will learn things like Police Station, Fire Station, Hospital, School, Town Hall, Grocery Store, and Post Office.  There are several different shapes too, including squares, rectangles, triangle, and the various signs.  The buildings and most of the roof pieces only have the building design on one side.  The trees, ambulance, fire truck, and mail truck are large and double sided.  The various street signs, and passenger cars are a little small, and as the box states ages 3+ and up, I would consider these smaller pieces a choking hazard.  The larger pieces are enjoyed by both my 1 yr old and my 3 yr old.  The rectangles are the largest piece in the set and measure 4 3/4 by 2 1/4" approx.  Squares are roughly 2 1/4 x 2 1/4".  These blocks are not as heavy as I expected, but still nicely made, and bright colorful additions to playsets like Thomas/Brio train sets.  If your children don't insist on the real thing, this is a great way to save some money and still buy a quality product.  
The only drawback is the wooden storage box doesn't come with a sliding plexi cover like the Melissa & Doug pizza set or beading set does.  That would be really nice for storage and secure those little pieces that we don't use

This game is very easy to learn.  Each of the 16 playing pieces has 4 attributes, height (tall & short), color (white and brown), shape (circle & square), and hollow/solid.  

The goal is to get 4 of the same attributes in a row (for example, you could have 1 tall white circle, 1 short white circle, 1 tall brown circle, and 1 short brown circle in a row, and that would be a winning set because they are all circles, even though they vary with respect to the other attributes).  

The catch is that your opponent picks the piece you have to place on the game board.  

This game is similar to SET, in that you are trying to make winning patterns across several attributes.  It is different because you are also trying to block your opponent from making winning patterns.  

I do wish this game were less expensive so that more people can enjoy it.  Not everyone can drop $30 for a game.  It is a beautifully made wooden game, but it would be just as much fun if it were made of something inexpensive and priced under $10. 

Nevertheless it is a game worth owning. And, for trivia buffs, this game was futuristic enough to appear in an episode of Star Trek Voyager :)

This game is very exciting for my son, he is five, I am teaching him to read his blends and this is a great reinforcer. I enjoy watching him do the math (one with the coins) as well as watching him make words.

It is fun!  And most importantly educational. It has a game where you have to put the exact amount of money in the game slot.  My kids like that part. They are 6 and 7 and ask me all the time if they can play their spongebob game, we are a two leapster family but they have to share their cartridges.  Next year my youngest will want one too, I am sure, as she wants to play theirs,but she is just too little yet, another year she will be 4 so will check into getting her one of her own then..

I don't know why poor Scrat got so many bad reviews. My kids absolutely LOVE this toy. They laugh hysterically every time and they're 4 1/2 and 7. He does have a tendency to fall down and doesn't scoot very well. But the laugh factor alone makes this well worth the money.

Ok, this toy does not deserve 5 stars but the other reviews were far too harsh.  The first 30 minutes of my chihuahua terrified by this thing were worth the price.  As a stuffed animal it's very cute but not too cuddly because it's hard plastic under the fur.  I love scrat in the movie and the sounds this thing makes are quite funny at first but the do get boring soon unless you have a family pet to terrorize like I do.  

Here's another trick.  Put Scrat on a pillow with your hadn behind him so you can make him move and wiggle his tail without being seen, then have someone bring in the family pet.  When I lunged at the dog's feet he screamed as being run through a meet grinder.  This may sound cruel but I assure you the dog was not hurt and now enjoys showing Scrat who's the boss whenever we turn him on

My three girls ages 3 to 7 liked this toy when added to their pretend food collection. We didn't use it as a game. You can place the different frosting and sprinkle combination pieces onto the different colors of donuts to make different varieties. Each would take a turn 'ordering' types of donuts and the others would 'make' them. Yes, the frosting won't stay on if the donut turns over but fits in easily and works great on a plate for pretend play! Box is flimsy but we just keep all the pieces in our general play food bin so not an issue. Would buy this again. Great for kids with imaginations

I have been in love with this game ever since I first played. It was a favorite at choir parties over the holidays in Chicago. Since I have moved, I keep one copy at my permanent address and another at my vacation home. It is great for all ages. We are very loose with the rules and find teams the most fun. It doesn't matter who wins. As long as we play, play, play...we laugh, laugh, laugh!

Most Old Skool fans are angry he's not a VW Beetle anymore. I kinda never liked beetles anyway, so Im happy with the new unlicenced thing. It looks like a mix of a MINI and a Peugeot. He transforms better than most, the picture does'nt do him justice, it makes him look stiff. Actually, for how bulky he is, he's amazingly bendable, I particularly like that his "door/shields" are'nt attached to his arm, their on a cuffling that rotates so they wont be too awkward like many of the others with "door/shields". The Jetski Jetpack adds an unneeded extra flair to an already awesome robo mode. And as an extra retro touch It has a tempurture sensitive decal on his chest/top of the car that must be held for a minute before it will reveal the autobot logo [just like his original 80s version]. I DO wish he had come with some sort of weapon, but I have a few other transformers from this same generation that don't really need BOTH that THEY came with. What's even MORE awesome for me is that I bought this at the grocery store, as one of the very few toys they had in thier christmas section, for $10 if your looking for just any ONE good transformer, bumblebee is a good choice. If you have Optimus, this one looks great standing beside him. Transformer fans Don't Delay, pick this one up! I can't wait to see movie's camaro bumblebee in july

Even though I'm convinced that all monitors work differently in different locations, this model has treated us well.  We got this monitor (with dual receivers) for my first daughter 3 1/2 years ago and it was always clear & crisp.  Reception was perfect in the basement, in the frontyard, in the backyard...even at the neighbor's house.  One of the receivers konked out after about 2 years but we survived with only one.  The second receiver finally stopped working last week & after doing waaaaayyyy too much internet research, I decided to go with the same, trusty, inexpensive monitor and it works great!  I've never slept with a monitor in our room (because our babies stay with us for a long time) so I don't know about nighttime quirks.  I keep the monitor in our kitchen area to listen for the little one waking up from naps....and to spy on the girls when they play upstairs without me. :)  Baby #3 is on the way & I'm sure this monitor will last another 3 years until we don't need it anymore.  So, $40 over the course of 3 children isn't bad!

My husband and I travel a lot and someone told us about this on one of our last cruises.. We actually watched 2 people playing it as well. So my husband actually remembered the name of this game and got this for me for a Christmas gift. Surprised me!! 
We plan on taking it with us on all our trips. We will be able to use it
on cruises, on planes, wherever we may have to play the waiting game. We know its good for 2 people on up!!! It seemed like a fun game

I bought this for my 5-year old daughter. She really enjoyed using it and actually enjoyed the challenge of having to figure out the answers in the shortest time possible. The different levels of difficulty are useful so she can keep using it over the years

Bought this one recently for my eight year old (and myself) to enjoy and it truly took only a few minutes to explain it to him and we were off and loving it.  More challenging than checkers and less complicated than chess makes it a very accessible game for an eight year old yet not too easy or complex such as can be the case for those two aforementioned games.  I highly recommend it as it can help your child in a number of ways in terms of concentrating and focusing, thinking spatially, understanding the consequences of a move or moves, and introducing the concept of strategy

My six month old grandson loves these toys!  They are perfect for the teether and he loves the colors and noise.  They hold his attention for much longer than some of his other toys.  They are easy for him to hold and shake.  I would buy them again in a minute.

My son and I thoroughly enjoyed assembling and learning about how robots work. This kit may be frustrating for one adult or child to assemble. The screws require more 'adult strength' (he would start them and I would finish) and some of the instructions might need at least 3 hands to hold and assemble. But hey, that is why it was so enjoyable - we did it together! It is fun now to watch him play with it and tell everyone 'my Dad and I built this'

This is a very handy product to have around for our 3-year old if the batteries happen to die while traveling.  The AC adapter is a life-saver for long car trips.

Just as an aside note, the adapter does NOT look like the one in the picture.  It is gray-and-orange, like the adapters you seen in the store

This is my daughters first "real" baby doll. She is almost 2, and I have never seen her love another toy like this one. She loves to give the baby kisses and feed her with the bottle it comes with, and I bought an extra outfit so she can change the baby for bed. This doll is really pretty compared to other baby dolls I have seen lately. The skin is a very soft, nice feeling plastic with a cloth torso, and smells like sweet baby powder! I was pleased when I was able to wipe off dirt that was on the dolls hand really easily. I love all the accessories that you can get for the Little Mommy dolls too. I highly recommend this one

We recieved this bed as a hand-me-down from a friend's child who used it until he was eight (would not give it up sooner). My son recieved the bed at two-years-old and is now four. This bed is durable! The bed we have is twelve years old and looks brand new. It is so easy to wipe clean. My son feels that his bed is special and just adores it. He sees "regular" beds other places and feels so proud that his bed is a blue race car. I have a feeling he'll want to stay in this bed until his feet are hanging off the end. Five stars

I purchased this as a Christmas Gift for my 1 year old nephew.  Very pleased with the online price through Toys-R-Us and Amazon.com, it was $50.00 less than in a retail store!  Very prompt shipping, had to be put together but not difficult with common household tools.  Very nice quality wagon, top of the line and well worth the money.  Rubber tires give a more comfortable ride for small children.  I also purchased the pad set.  Fits perfectly, looks great nad comfy ride, but be sure to purchase the pad set for the Model #29 All-Terrain Cargo Wagon (BP-29), as other pad sets will not fit!  Very nice onverall. Don't hesitate to buy!

I had to buy my 4 year old a new Leap Pad after his old one wore out.  He is currently obsessed with Spiderman so I grabbed this one.  I didn't realize it came with the Spiderman book I was going to buy him soon anyway (saved me $15)!   So far the new Leap Pad and Spiderman book have been a huge hit!

this elmo item is pretty cool. if ur child is an elmo fan then im sure you know how annoying these elmo doll/ toys can be.. oh jeez the voice is so loud and it echoes.!!! however this one is far less annoying than the rest because he hums when you plug his mouth -- im srry i meant ta say when you give him his pacifier (lol)-- you just hear an adorable hum sound. Overall this is a cool gift. Theres is an off button I only wish there was a lower volume button for early morning play

This wagon was easy to put together.  We use it frequently when picnicking outdoors and going to the park.  It is big enough for my 2 year old to lie down and take a nap.  It was also large enough to hold our lunch cooler and my daughter.  It is very easy to pull around and is very durable

We absolutely love this wagon! My 2yr old will ride as long as I want to walk, stop, detour, whatever...she's glued! It is huge & on the heavy side. But also huge(you can carry so much/many children)w/ great quality & durability. I can easily see us w/ this wagon for years to come & would suggest it to anyone comparing.

I purchased the Parents Magazine version first and my one year old son didn't play with it much but after watching him go crazy at a friends house with this Hasbro toy I purchased it and he has been playing with it ever since.  The buttons are placed in such a way that he can hold it with both hands and press buttons at the same time.  He also enjoys teething on the keys.  I highly recommend this product for mothers who want to hold on to their own keys

This McQueen is different than the regular McQueen - slightly darker maroon with a white swoosh on both sides - it is supposed to be the McQueen that appears after the Radiator Springs team fixes him up...my son was slightly disappointed though because the wheels were not white.  I found out there was yet another McQueen with the whitewall tires.  Go figure

I say that because the paint on these cars chips VERY easily.  The Hamm car was already chipped sealed in the package.  My son's Matchbox cars, which get tossed into their basket quite regularly, don't seem to chip near as easy as the Cars ones do.  Never-the-less, kids don't care.  Though, my son (who is only 3-1/2) is wondering why they didn't make a red Ramone or the announcer Cars (Bob and Darryl)??

Also, FOR COLLECTORS, the Sarge and Fillmore are shown on the back of the card as being sold as individual items, but on the back of the Hamm card, they are not shown.  I have as of yet see them sold individually on the Supercharged card

I enjoy playing with this toy and it trains me to be a good Mom.  Your tamagotchi's appearance depends on how you care for it.  Mine turned into Mametchi. Mametchi is a really good character to have.  I have enjoyed this toy so much.

YOU SHOULD DEFINATELY BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The v4, the newest american tamagotchi, is much like its previous japanese counterparts, the entama and uratama. This tamagotchi goes to school, interviews for jobs, and then has a career. Each career has its own game, so there are many more games on this tama than the v3. There is also a mail icon that flashes when your tama gets mail. [...

I read the reviews before buying this product, and I do agree that it is messy with the markers, suitable for children that are a little older.  It is fun, and very cute, but a little messy to wash off.  I just buy a pack of baby wipes at the dollar store, and let the kids clean off the screen with them, and then throw them out.  It works wonderfully, and the problem is solved, since the included sponge is not very helpful.  I would purchase this again, especially for the price

Anything Leappad is great . Its one of the best things to come from the computer toy area for kids yet. My son is ahead of his class in reading with the help of Leappad. At 6 he reads at a midrange grade 1 student and is progressing quickly. I highly recommend This and any other Leap pad book and toy . Most schools have dropped Phonics from the classrooms and Leappad has brought it back in a fun form your little one will love..

I purchased the Miss Weather Dress-Up Set for my cousin's two year old daughter. At her birthday party, all the other gifts were forgotten as she sat and played with the Colorforms. The adults were waiting in line to play with them also! This set has larger pieces which are perfect for younger children. This is the perfect gift...inexpensive, fun, promotes fine motor and speech/language skills, and has educational value

I would recommend this game to any and everyone completely.  I would have to say if there are choppy portions on your dvd player then it might be time to buy a newer dvd player.  Ours was flawless ran so smoothly and it's sooo much fun.  Most fun with multiple people but still fun with a few.

I would only hope that in the future they put a few more games and also maybe full motion video instead of pictures of products.  

Never got tired of the game and like I said I recommend it to everyone.

Thanks,

The game itself is actully pretty good.  You can go through the entire Price is right game or you can just go to each section.  Like if you just wanted to do the pricing games, there's that option or you can do the showcase showdown etc...

There are times that the graphics of the game lag, which is kind of odd since to me since I wasn't playing it on a computer, but on my DVD player.

The pricing games are 'random' but you do tend to get some of the same games more than other games.

You can technically play this game by yourself, but it's obviously going to be more fun the more people you have

My daughter got this for her 6th birthday.  She absolutely loves it, as does her 3 year old sister.  One of them is using it all the time.  The 3 different tops on the wand are a little frustrating for my 3 year old, as she can't switch them out herself and comes running to have someone else switch the tops for her.  My 6 year old has caught onto all of the dance moves and is able to do them along with the DVD.  My 3 year old can't do them all, but she has a great time just doing what she can.  Both of my girls love Cinderella, so they put on their dress up Cinderella dresses whenever they do the DVD.  I wish there was a way to order just an extra mat, though, so they could do the DVD together instead of fighting over who gets to stand on the mat

This is a toy that my son always wants to play with and we've had this dinosaur for quite a while now.  Usually, we buy our son a toy that he pleads for (he likes it soooooo much) and it looks like fun but then it ends up in the back of his closet after a few days of playing with it.  This brontosaurus makes a booming sound with his feet when you pull a trigger underneath which both my sons love (4 & 2) and the included figures are great.  This toy stands up to the brutual tug of war that accompanies our two small boys and it is quite the bargain at the price.  I highly recommend all of the dinosaurs and cavemen in this series.  Not only does it keep my sons busy (oh yeah)  but it also helps built their imagination as I hear them tell each other all these stories about their dinosaurs.  Imaginext has even come out with "NEW" dinosaurs in this line which can be found at Target or other stores (I have found that TRU has a limited selection).

This is a nice toy for kids to ride on.  My daughter loves the little horn.  There are some little figurines that go inside the seat which activate the music.  That does not work well at all.  There are also little toy holders for the figuerines but those never get used either.  It's a cute riding toy but a lot of the features don't work well.  Worth the buy if a family is really into the John Deere theme

This is a great doll--we gave it to our 2-year-old daughter last week and she now carries her everywhere, feeds her, reads to her, puts her to bed, covers her with a blanket, and obsessively pats her on the back and tush.  She's quite cuddly and soft; you'll want to hold her yourself.  You might expect from the pictures that the arms and legs would be hard plastic like the head, but in fact they are very soft and pliable, and the trunk of the body is all cloth, like a pillow, with a bean-bag tushie.  The headband is removable but actually stays on there pretty well.  The eyes don't have those stupid eyelids you usually see on baby dolls, the ones that open and shut when you lift the doll, and that always seem to stop working properly after a couple of weeks.  We'll see how "Maria" holds up to the kind of punishment our daughter can mete out, but she seems pretty durable.  What a great purchase!

I agree that the Denver reviwer is totally out to lunch. This doll greatly resembles my daughter's friend Jenny Liu. Jeeny  was born in Taiwan. Chinese people don't look any one way and to expect them to is racist, like saying they all look alike.
 The hair ornaments are plastic but they do look good . The dress looks redder when you display her out of the box.Fabric quality is better than average for Mattel. Her hair is also much nicer and has more style than Mattel had been giving us. I think this doll bodes well for  better things to come  in this doll series.

The Big Bubbler is the greatest bubble wand----we have had consistently huge bubbles with the top-of-the-line/expensive bubble solution, as well as, the cheapest $1.99 jugs.  The only thing that didn't work at all for us was straight dish detergent (hey, we were desperate).  My youngest toddler will chase the bubbles endlessly, and even a neighbor's preteen son couldn't resist chasing the large bubbles across our yard.  I also like that I am playing WITH the kids when I make the bubbles for them vs. simply turning on a battery-operated machine and then standing back. 

If I had to gripe, it would only be to say that I wish the top of the wand (the end that holds the bubble solution) could be stood on end.  It is hard for the little ones to keep the top from spilling while waving the wand; it is also tough for them to get the wand back into the top to get more bubble solution.

We also go through a LOT of solution---I plan to buy a few large jugs of it to have it on hand.  But, this seems like a minor inconvenience given how much fun we have all had watching the bubbles dance all over our yard

I am confused by the poor reviews of this product. My daughter received this toy from the Easter bunny this year and the whole family plus Grandparents/Aunts/Uncles etc. have had a ball with it. It creates huge bubbles round or long, that float in the air for quite a bit of time. I do agree that the solution runs out very quickly and it is too hard for a three year old to work...but for the price I have to say this toy is WELL WORTH IT! We also made our own solution (Granny's recipe) and it worked...very messy and sudsy though. I would recommend this product to anyone who loves bubbles

My 8 yr old grandson wanted this for Christmas but the price was over $100 so when I saw it for under $15 on Amazon, I got it for his birhtday in February.  He and his 9 yr old brother LOVE it!  I also purchased one booster pack at the same time.  Then I found another game and booster pack at Target for a very reasonable price. So he got the game system, two games and two booster pack of cards all for under $50.00!  Both he and I were happy!  (The only reason I give this a "4" is because the games are a bit hard to come by

I bought this game for my 7 year old last winter - because he loved the book so much.  He quickly mastered the game, which requires you to earn state cards by recognizing certain items about each state, such as the color of the card, whether the capital starts with a certain letter or if the state nickname has a person's name embedded in it.  All his friends liked the game when they came over, so I ended up buying and giving at least 6 more as birthday presents for his friends and for a niece and nephew.  But, more than that, this game has spawned a further interest in geography in my son.  He began playing with a wooden puzzle of the USA as a result of the information on the game cards. In doing so, he taught himself most of the capitals (which are also on the game cards) and the shapes of the various states.  He continues to want to learn more about US geography.  I highly recommend the book and game for ages 5 and up.

My granddaughter loves the buckets.  They are large and easy for little hands to pick up.  They make great hats and are great for putting things in as well as for the coordination of putting them on top of each other.  The colors are bright and the plastic is sturdy. A great gift for little ones and older ones as well.

I don't care if it stops working tomorrow... my daughter has gotten so much enjoyment out of this in just one day that it was totally worth the money.   (you can get them cheaper at Target though)  She was always stealing the portable phones around the house or walking off with my cell phone... and now she has "her" phone she is just delighted.... she loves when it rings and she opens it up and pretends to talk.... so far this phone works great, but like I said... it is such a cool toy I'd go out and buy a new one right away.

My infant just likes the crinkly fishy that comes with the buckets.  I'm sure she will grow into this toy.  I do wonder how I'm going to keep the felty material clean especially when she starts putting these things to her mouth.

While nothing beats wood blocks (in my opinon) we had these first, and they are fun! We like that they are flexible and easy for little hands to manipulate, and not painful if they fall on you!  The only downside is that they are large, and storing them in the bag is like putting together a puzzle-they JUST fit.  Storing them in a toy box fills the box with wasted space; so we stack them in 4 rows beside the toy box. It's worth the hassle if you have space for them and don't mind stacking them up and teaching your little one to

After assembling a Dora's Talking Cash Register that scans the wrong items, a Dora's talking backpack that is just plain dumb- this is the toy that scored this Christmas!  This toy is easy for my 3 year old to maneuver the pony in and out of the walker and actually works like you would expect.  Plus the pony is fun to play with out of the walker.  My daughter doesn't even question why it only talks in the walker. So what if it doesn't!  It will be fun to sleep with because it is soft and has pajamas on.  I would recommend this toy- very cute and fun!

We LoVe this game. We were first introduced to it at our children's preschool where it fast became a favorite at "free choice time". The children engaged in it delightfully and playfully. Everyone has fun. The game board is durable and can be constructed differently over and over again -- this works out so great because with all the repeated play ours gets the kids are not memorizing the spot the item was. I worried a little that it might be too competitive and those that were "better" at it might leave those not as quick at hunting feeling discouraged, BUT have not ever found that to be the case when we have the game out at home or at the school. The board is brightly colored the items are fascinatingly fun to search for. It is a challenge even for us BIG kids. I would recommend it highly for a fun family activity game

This is a good toy for a toddler, not a baby. I've used this toy in two different setting (first as a nanny and then as a mom) and both times, the babies were terrified of it. It's just too much stimulation for a 9 month old. The balls fly everywhere and you've got to run about after them to keep it going; unless of course, you've got a toddler, then they can run about after the balls (which seems to be half the fun for them). Good toy, but not until maybe 14 months.

I purchased both of the Mega Bloks Pyrates Ships and have built two other Mega Bloks vessals before, namely the Man-o-War models from the Dragons line and they wer both more difficult to construct than this one so if you want a challege try finding them instead. The first thing I noticed when I opened it up was the lack of pieces in the set, almost the entire ship simply snaps together, a ten-year-old could do it. There isn't a lot of rigging like in the Playmobil series that will keep coming undone either. All in all it can be assembled in 30 min to an hour. The finished products are full of detail and Mega Bloks has gotten better at it each time, anyone who follows their Dragons line will know what I mean. I'll post a review of the Phantom next and I caint wait to get the Privateer ship Blue Beard's Avenger it looked massive at Toy Fair. With the Pirates of the Caribbean 2 and 3 films coming out this line is sure to be a hit

My 14 mo old son just got his go kart today.  He loves it.  He loves pushing the button and making it go.  He hasn't figured out the steering yet but we have a long straight entry way to our home so no need to steer yet.  My 4 yr old daughter also loves it and fits into it just fine (about 40 in tall and 35 lbs).  She received the razor go kart herself and loves it but that one is outside only.  They have had the best time today playing with the PW go kart.  I agree with other reviewers that holding down the button is hard for little ones but they figure out ways to get around it.  (The razor go-kart also has a thumb throttle control)  We got the Lil Quad 4 wheeler for my daughter when she was one and would still ride it if she didn't have the big 4-wheeler.  Now both kids can ride their 4-wheelers together or their go karts.  Thanks Santa for 2 great gifts

I bought this for my 5 year old grandson, he is VERY active and I thought it would be a good way to burn up some of that extra energy!  Not only does he love it, but so does his 2 year old sister.  My daughter tells me that they both dance and dance, until they fall down laughing.  This was certainly a good buy

Being a preschool teacher I use these all of the time. I have found that taking the sheets out individually clipping them to the easels clip to be the best way to work with them. Even if you don't have an easel these are wonderful for children of all ages. Large, unlined sheets of paper encourage children to be creative and to express themselves in a completely original way. For infants, toddlers, and preschoolers I will often tape the sheets to the table and let them color/paint/glue to their hearts delight

Comment given by my four year old son Bilal, "I like this game because the buzzing things are so close to each other. This is good because it's fun. Also it'a hard to get the things out and this makes it fun. I play this came with my dad. I got the game because it has shrek on it. I win this game sometimes. The cards have funny things on them and it makes me laugh.

I bought this for Christmas for my three children ages 4 (twins) and 18 mos. Although the younger child doesn't really get the games we play with it, the older ones do and we all have a great time. My goal was to get them to be active during the winter (less TV time), and this works for about 30 minutes. I only wish we had a bigger house so I could have gotten the bigger parachute. I can't wait to play with it outside when it gets warm

I bought this set for my 3.5 year old.  We have had a great time putting it together on several occasions in the last couple of weeks. Once put together, my son imagines adventures on it with the included soldiers.  I am not very mechanically inclined but the instructions are excellent, well-illustrated and clear, and I had no problem with them.  (My only quibble is that the orange sticks in the manual are a different shade of color from the ones in our set, and took a moment to identify.)  At first my son just wanted to put together the foam walls, but the second time around he wanted to help constructing the walls of the castle.  By imitating me, he was able to make duplicate versions of some simple structures rather well.  He also figured out how to make the soldiers all by himself, with their arms, legs, helmets, swords and shields.  Through doing the set I also was able to explain that you have to build the foundation first before you can put in the walls and floors, and the third time we made the castle, he was repeating this point to me!  The drawbridge is really fun and well-done.  It raises and lowers very smoothly.  This particular set is really only designed to make the castle, so it's not really meant for making many different things like the other Superstruct sets.  But this was our first one and I have no regrets.  Assembly time was about 30 minutes the first time, but after you do it once it seems closer to 15 minutes.  The pieces are high-quality, fit very well, and are generally a joy to handle and see.  The castle looks great once assembled, and will impress any adults or kids who see it

I bought this wireless weather station as a gift.  The recipient loves it.  For the price, he is really enjoying it.  The only things he would change are:

-interface to computer so that data could be tracked
-display of actual barometric pressure value

These two features are available on more expensive models so I imagine in the future we will be upgrading

My 7-year-old daughter loves this tub of K'nex, and has now foresworn her LEGOs.  400 pieces does not go as far as you might expect, however; you may find yourself shopping for an expansion set soon.

LEGO:
  * you can build houses
  * simple stacking approach
  * upgrade to Technics for 3D building
  * those adorable little LEGO people
  * wider variety of pieces and sets

K'Nex:
  * 3-dimensional construction
  * more complicated trigonometric approach
  * you can build bridges
  * everything can rotate

And I saw a K'Nex set that lets you join LEGO and K'Nex ..

Both my 3-year old daughter and my 5-year old son (to his father's chagrin) love playing with and endlessly dressing Dora. Her outfits are darling and my children enjoy mixing and matching (or not-so-matching in some cases) the clothes, too. We are looking forward to adding new outfits as well as the armoire and bed - Dora needs a place to sleep!

Dora is well made and sturdy, and her clothing has even been through the wash and no harm done. 

And I have to admit ... I've been known to dress Dora a time or two myself. We have the same problem with the shoes not staying on well, but it doesn't seem to bother my little ones at all

Bought this for our girls, 2 and 4. Huge hit, even before the batteries were put in the blow dryer. This set is great for several reasons, and I'll try to list the top few. First, the dryer actually has a little fan in it that whirrs loudly enough to seem real, but not so loud as to disturb the cat when she is getting her fur done. (uncommon for a kid's toy) Also, the nail polish and eyeshadow are both made to open and "use", but no mess. And once you have removed the inner packing materials, the bag is large enough for headband and tiara storage. A must for today's Princess. The one thing I will caution you about is the curling iron. If your child has longer hair like my girls do, it can get tangled when hair is being "curled". Fortunately, the curler has no moving parts, so tangles are discovered long before any permanent damage is done. All in all, a pretty sturdy little set for $15. Great for practice make-overs and such, but probably not for experienced princesses, as there is no actual make-up involved, just imagination. Perfect for my house! No glittery door handles or perfumed pets!

Why do some people call Bratz dolls 'sluts/slutz'? Are you guys mad? They are just dolls. They are made of plastics. So what they wear SHORT mini skirt? They just DOLLS. If you hated mini skirt soooo much, well don't wear them.
I saw many teenage celebs wear mini skirts.
THEY ARE JUST DOLLS, okay? No need to argue if they wear short mini skirts. 
Anyway, about this doll I am totally adore her. She is very pretty and very ROCKSTAR material (I don't know how 2 spell.I don't care about her having tatoos. Lot of celeb got tatoos and she's a rockstar material.

I bought these for my 5 year old son who is a huge Car's fan. He was using matchbox cars and pretending that they were Lightening McQueen and friends, but when he recieved the set of these he was so excited. These cars are larger than matchbox cars, and are heavy for their size, good quality!! Great for the Car's fan in your life

My daughter really wanted this for Christmas.  She really has played and played with it ever since.  I wish that it came with some dry erase markers for the board in it but other than that we have been very pleased with the product

I got this for my 5 year old, who started kindergarten this fall, and she is in love with the whole school concept.  She loves to pretend to be the teacher with this playset.  Her friend came over one day and played with it, too, and they took turns being the student and teacher.   I ended up buying another set for her friend's birthday.

Fly Through Spanish is some of the best software for the Fly pen available.  You can write a word in English and hear the Spanish translation, or write a Spanish word and hear the English translation.  The translator will also spell out translations for you (my only complaint is that the translations are spelled a bit too quickly, especially if you're trying to write them down).  The cartridge even comes with some games to help you learn Spanish words.  Fly Through Spanish also comes with a booklet that has verb conjugation charts and ideas for games you can play.  I was very impressed with the verb charts.  They actually includes all the tenses and a chart of irregular verbs.  Fly Through Spanish is a great tool for learning and practicing Spanish words.  Please keep in mind that this software will not teach you Spanish but it is a wondeful and downright fun addition to a class or self-study program.

I hope that Leapfrog releases more languages, especially French

Any game that gets my husband dressed up in a tiara and earrings while playing a board game with his girls, is a GREAT game! It's simple to play for anyone over age 3 (unless the child is orally fixated- there are smaller pieces, so use YOUR better judgment!), is fast enough to hold a child's (and adult's!) interest, and let's everyone relax and not worry about rules- we really enjoy it and are wearing it out pretty quickly. It has been a great gift for other friends as well as it's not too well-known.

Santa Claus brought this game for my daughter for Christmas and she LOVES it! It doesn't take terribly long to play, so it's a great game to hold the attention of a nearly 5-year-old. We've even talked Dad and big brother into playing, and there's a (playful) fight over who has the crown. The perfect gift for little girls. Thank you, Santa

This is a well engineered product; I cannot call it a toy because it is much much more than that. After building just one of the sample setups I was able to put down the manual and start creatively designing and building my own. My daughter (3.5 years old) loves it. She really likes placing a marble on the run when I tell her its time to "test it", and I let her identify the error. The only marbles that have fallen off the track are due to construction errors by myself. After 1 day (and several of our own setups) we already find ourselves wanting more pieces. I suggest buying the largest set from the get go if you have an engineering type mind or just enjoy puzzles. Nice feature to note : the coloring of the blocks is logical; each color has its own unique function(s).

My toddler (22 months) LOVES this doll.  There's something about his wide open mouth and little round nose that enchants her.  She actually threw over Elmo for Ernie.  I never thought I'd see the day.  Ernie is carried all around with her, and the nose gets lots of kisses.  Great toy for girl or boy fan of Sesame Street

I played this when I was young so I thought my 2 1/2 year old would enjoy it too.  She got to pick which color she wanted to be, and we counted how many ants to get into the pants.  It took a little practice, but she got plenty of ants in and had soooo much fun.  We really had a great time

After I read the reviews on this toy, I wanted to cancel my order. Thankfully I didn't because my kids love it. I have two boys 5 & 9 and they love bowling with this toy. My kids have played with it since we got it in Feburary. In the reviews, people said the toy broke soon after playing with it. My kids play with it all the time and we have not had any problems. Everything still works great; the pins, the sound, and the ball return.

I am quite fond of this character.  Sure, he is a horribly evil dictator who wouldn't give a second thought to breaking you in half if you looked at him wrong, but you have to understand where he's coming from.  As the Hulk, Bruce Banner focused his rage against evil to help humanity.  Then there is a world-wide nuclear holocaust, the world is a wasteland, and, as the Hulk, Bruce sucks up a lot of the radiation.  Fusing his mind to the Hulk's, I think he has a right to be a little screwed up and angry.  This highly possible figure comes with a spiky crown thing and the appropriate comic book.  He may not make a great center piece, but the figure is good looking, none-the-less

This is the only figure in the Apocalypse series that dose not have a variant figure. Kinda makes you wish it were the Sentinel series, and if you can find them, most of them are variants that you might actually want. I was fortunate enough to hit Wal-Mart at a time when the shelves must have been just stocked, because the racks were full, and all five variants were right there in front. Needless to say I bought all 5. But Maestro, as far as I know has had one appearance in the entire Marvel Universe, so what variant is even possible.
Despite some protests that this is "another Hulk figure" this is not some namby pamby rehashed Hulk with screaming action, fist pounding, and slightly purplier pants that we've seen a dozen times before, but an almost entirely all new figure. One reviewer said the body was based on the Smart Hulk figure, but I wasn't lucky enough to snag one, so I don't have a basis of comparrison.
However, he is well muscled, warty, and weathered alot like he looks in the included issue of Captain Marvel. And if your wondering just what exactly to do with him, fear not, Captain Marvel is to be released in Series XV near the end of this year. Then he can go a few rounds with your Maestro. Now ML, where's our Legends 2099 Spidey? (He was also in that CM comic.)
He is a good figure, could be a little bigger, like more on scale with Juggernaut from Series VI, but he does come with the Apocalypse piece whcich is a great figure in and of itself

The Maestro, the evil future intelligent world conquering version of the Hulk, comes with one arm and arm tube of the mighty Apocalypse.  Apocalypse being the kick butt 14" giant figure you can build if you buy the six figures in this series.

Maestro Hulk has great paint and body sculpt with tons of detail and his muscles are so huge it looks like his skin may burst.  His beard is scuplted and painted well and he comes with his crazy pointy hat that fits well on his bald head.  He is a touch shorter than I'd like and this plus the swelled size of his arms and hands and his funny clothes do make him look dwarf like but once you get used to it it grows on you.  Overall a really cool figure and someone to take on the first appearance grey Hulk from the Galactus series.  Talk about alpha and omega

We looked everywhere for this float after borrowing one while swimming at the lake with our 11 month old.  The nice thing about it is that it provides a safe and comfortable ride while allowing the child to be right in the water and splash around.  We can swim right alongside and spin him around or swim underneath to come and suprise him from the other side.  We don't have to worry much about the water being too deep because the float is so stable.  I would say the only drawback is that while it inflates fairly easily, squeezing all the air out and collapsing the float can take a few tries.  I would recommend this product to anyone with an older baby who wants to take their child for a float in calm water

My one-year-old son had a great time playing with these blocks ...  He loved the colors and shapes.  He really enjoyed knocking down my block creations.  We had such a good time playing with the blocks that I decided to go on-line to buy him some.  I was shocked at the price.  I cannot believe [what] these blocks cost ...  For thirty-two foam blocks?!?!?!?!  Forget it.  It's too bad that these blocks are cost restrictive; they're great fun, but not worth the price

This is one of the most fun games I've every played.  There are tons of belly laughs as people try to bluff their way through an answer to a question.  I find the questions (and answers) are quite educational too, I've learned a lot from these questions.  A group of family members played at Christmas (6 of us) and it was hilarious to watch some people try to come up with an answer to the question (a bluff).   We even let our 5 year old nephew "play" and he was pretty good with coming up with some bluffs.  Try it, it is loads of fun.  I recommend a group of at least 4 though

I was so glad when my little sister got this game for her birthday! Unfortunaty our version wasn't like the version I had when I was young. For some reason the people stand didn't open or close very well. So while for some you could smack down, others you had to jiggle and wiggle to get to lay flat. Not only that but when we would start a new game, you're soppose to be able to just flip the board over and all the stands would flip out. Well for the red board they didn't flip so well, in fact only a few would flip up with out help. That could have been my fault when I put the pieces together. 
The game was still fun, althought it was hard teaching my six year old sister not to exclaim out loud that she's glad of who she got because she likes her hat. Although I didn't have a problem with her picking her person instead of doing it randomly,(like you're soppose too) I still love this game and forever will.

I've been consistently impressed by the Bionicle toys from Lego, and the Rahkshi are no exception.  Wish I was young enough to actually play with this stuff.  Sigh.  Anyway, Rahkshi take the Bionicle can-sold figures to new a new level of articulation.  In total, joints are found at the neck, shoulder, wrist, hip, knee, and ankle, and the crank on the back swivels the entire arm assembly from side to side so you can whack things with the staff-like weapon each of the Rahkshi weilds.  Then there's  the opening case on the back so you can flip spooky little rubber leech/slug things through the air.  Each one of these things appears to come with a miniature CD full of Quicktime promotional stuff for the toys, game, web site, etc.  The voice is a bit melodramatic, but it's still kind of neat.  I like the 360-degree rotating model of the toy you just bought...sort of redundant, since you can look at the one in real life, but nifty all the same.  One thing that mildly disappointed me is that the Rahkshi's weapon isn't really an independanly existing object - which is to say that the bar held between the "hands" is only attached to the hands, not the heads of the weapon.  This isn't a really big deal, except that it means you can't have the figure hold the weapon in only one hand.  This could be rectified with 2 small technic pieces, of course, but it does mean you'd have to add extra bits to the set from somewhere else.  Overall, a very cool build-it-yourself action figure that could either be set to stand looming on your monitor at work, or actually played with.  Educational value is limited to following instructions and demonstration of structural principles, as in any Lego set.  Durability seems good so far - Lego is pretty sturdy stuff

Bought for 2 year old twins... it held up with about 5 kids in it and even an adult at the birthday party.  The only thing that doesn't appear to be the greatest is the detachable steering wheel because with my kids it would end up missing in no time.   Definitely a great gift.

This is the greatest thing, I was worried because some of the reviews said it was not made good and it was easily torn.  Not only has it lived up to my 3 year old, but we set it up outside and all the kids come and play, it has not torn.  It sparks great imagination.  All her friends go to school now, this allows her to pretend with them that she is going also.  And best of all, we can store it anywhere when we are done, she has even learned to close it up and put it away.  I highly recommend this bus to all!!

I got this game for my then nearly 4-year-old daughter and a year later she still enjoys playing it.  The game is VERY simple and does not require reading. All the parts and pieces are high quality. It's a good opportunity to work with numbers and measuring, plus the game goes fast so you can play it quickly if needed or multiple rounds if you have the time/inclination.

The object is to create the tallest character by mixing/matching 5 parts (feet, legs, body, head, and hat).  The character pieces are brightly colored and fun and include: ballerina, doctor, fireman/woman, policeman/woman, cowboy/cowgirl, and a clown.  A roll of the die determines which part you select.  The die has both pictures and words--except for the WILD side which is printed in red. 

After the characters are assembled each player measures with the included ruler (you can choose centimeters or inches) to see whose character is the tallest. It's a sliding ruler with a base so the kids can actually fit their character inside and line up the top with the corresponding number on the ruler.

I wouldn't recommend this game for kids beyond 5--it may be a little too simple.  But for 3/4/5's it's a great game

I first became aware of "Eat It" through an article in the Washington Post. My family enjoyed playing the game so much that we invited the creators of "Eat It" to appear at an event in our local community. It is a game that truly the whole family can have fun playing together. My seven year old daughter, Emma, was thrilled to learn that one of the questions asked in the game was about a candy bar that was called "Fat Emma", and was hoping that it was still being sold,(it isn't). GREAT GAME

I think that this was a great item - something unique from what I can usually find around here.  My daughter loved it.  Like any other Polly items, lots of little pieces but overall very nice.  I was a bit miffed when I found out that the photo booth really doesn't take photos.  I guess I should have thought about that a bit more.  Overall, it's just fine

I love the Luke Fx lightsaber more than any other one because it is made nicely, it is light, and it has a good glow in the dark that makes it look real. I would not even dream of fighting with it, I would think it would break in a few days of fighting. There is not much to say except it is the best Fx next to the Darth Vader and it looks cool in the dark. It is so bright it lights up a whole room when the lights are off

Santa brought this for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas and she loves it.  She takes it in the car with her with her baby doll and belts it in with the seat belt.  One of the things I love about it is it isn't too heavy for her to carry.  She can carry it with her baby doll in it without any trouble.  It is also very sturdy.  She has even sat in it herself and it didn't break.  I would recommend this doll carrier.  It is great for little people who enjoy pretending to be mommy and daddy

You know the family games that you regret buying, especially when you see your child coming at you with it on a rainy day, saying, "Will you play this with me?" Well, Rat-a-Tat-Cat is not one of these.

It's simple enough to learn, but there is enough challenge in it to keep even an adult guessing. Rat-a-Tat-Cat was a gift to our family, but when my youngest daughter (age 4 or 5 at the time) got the hang of it, it became her favourite and here's why: 1)Though she was just learning numbers, she could understand the game, 2)The guessing part of the game put her on equal par with adults, to her delight. 3)Even for a busy adult, it's easy enough to sit down and play this game and actually can be relaxing. 4) If a guest came over, my daughter was able to explain the game rules to the guest and soon she'd have even teenage guys sitting cross-legged on the floor trying to get rid of the rats. Good ice-breaker.

Simply put, rats are bad, cats are good. High points ~ you don't want them.  The higher the number on the card, the more rat-power in the drawing. Zero is the best, with rats gone and a cat installed as a happy Statue of Liberty. The drawings are whimsical & clever. 
The reason it's a success as a game for all ages is because though it appears simple, there is the element of not knowing what your cards are and even if you peek (with permission), opponents can take your best away from you. So, if you don't mind losing to a kid and making that kid's day, as well as having a laugh, go ahead and get this game. My daughter is older now and we still play it.  She's also learned to be a good loser :-

I read about this RC racer in  Family Fun magazine and it got best toy for 10-12 age group and they were Right!  It is alot of fun to put together..not too hard, but a good challenge...It can also be made into a different model,we went online to lego and got the directions.

It is  also sturdy, maneuvers, speeds up to 13 miles in hours and can take all kinds of terrain including snow jumps. The battery has given us about an hour of hard driving.The remote is alot of fun to use. I loves it...its spendy, but I've already had hours of fun

My 9 month old received this for Christmas and loves it!  He is not quite crawling yet, he sort of scoots around and loves to grab and wrestle this toy.  So far it has been very sturdy but yet soft enough for the baby to roll on and squeeze.  The voice and phrases it says are so very cute too, we love the little giggle and when it says "Hello Baby"!! This is an adorable toy

We (my husband and I) brought this toy for our 2 year old last Christmas because then she was an Elmo fanatic. She still plays with this toy even though her intrests have shifted to Dora! At first I wasn't quite sure what this thing did except make noise but as I watched her play with it, I realized it taught her to follow directios.
It's a mode where elmo asks you to follow the light and the keys light up one by one as you press them and I was truly amazed at my baby actually following the directions.
This toy also teaches numbers. Overall, this toy is great for toddlers and tends to stay a favorite unlike those toys that end up at the bottom of the toybo

I just found this car at ToysRUs for $3.49; plus others in this series. I came online to Amazon to see if I could find characters not available at the store and I was blown away by these prices--$29.99???? You've got to be kidding me! I bought the TOY cars for my five year old son to PLAY with--the only reason I can see TOYS being priced this high is they must be trying to catch collectors. I'm glad I could find what I did at a local store; I definitely would not pay these high prices...
I would have been very happy to buy others in the series from Amazon, but at these prices I am definitely NOT going to!

My daughter received this loom as a gift for her 6th birthday. Even though the box says for ages 7 and up, and even though she's not the most nimble-fingered kid, she has no trouble using this loom with just a little help. The materials seem to be high quality and it comes with a good amount of thick, colorful yarn. The loom has been keeping my daughter happily occupied for long periods of time. She enjoys watching me knit, but doesn't have the dexterity yet to knit herself, so she's thrilled to be able to weave herself scarves and the like

When it first came out almost 20 years ago, I saw this game at a bookstore and bought it to take on a Christmas skiing vacation with my family.  Unfortunately, my mother ended up having emergency gallbladder surgery instead.  We didn't have gifts that year, but we did made it to Colorado and spent hours by the fire laughing until our ribs ached playing this crazy game.  It doesn't matter if you can draw, it's how fast you can put something down that halfway suggests the word they give you, and how ridiculous everyone's scribblings usually look.  I've played it with an artist. He couldn't even draw a nose and chin in the 20 seconds he had, so his artistic standards took a dramatic tumble. If my spirits need a boost, I play this game. Buy it.  You'll love it

This game was given to our 3 year old as a gift and he loves it.  His little sister, who is two, also loves this game.  This game really helps to develop a childs ability to concentrate on visual cues.  It is basically a matching game combined with a puzzle concept.  There are no complex rules to learn, so within minutes of opening the box any child can begin to play and enjoy this game.  As each match is made the child receives immediate reward and motivation to find a new match.  Best of all is that this is a simple game with no buzzers or bells and is best played with the TV turned off

We recently played BONKERS at our game club. As we read the instructions we were hoping going BONKERS would be fun and it was. BONKERS is a game based on asking players questions.  The questions are not trivia and knowledge-based questions, but instead word-based questions.  For instance, a question might ask you to "Come up with words that end in BELL".  During your turn you have 30 seconds to "Go Bonkers" trying to blurt out answers like: BARBELL; DUMBBELL; DOORBELL, COWBELL etc.  Your goal would be to find as many answers as possible in order to hit any or all of the four answers provided on the game card.   For every answer you hit, you win scoring chips. That was just one category of questions called ADD ONS - where you find words that begin or end with a certain word.  The other categories are:  WHAT THE BLANK - where you find words to complete the blank;  RHYME TIME - where you find as many rhymes as possible in order to match those provided on the game card; and LETTER PERFECT - where you would find words which begin or end with certain letters.  The game play is interesting because there is some strategy thrown in.  At the beginning of the round, one player (the Card Reader) peeks at the Question and Answers on Game Card and decides how many scoring chips each answer is worth.  So, in the example above, the card reader might allocate 5 scoring chips to the answer COWBELL, four chips to BARBELL, three chips to DUMBELL and two chips to DOORBELL.  This is done by placing the chips on the gameboard under target answer "A"; "B", "C" or "D".  The object is for the card reader to decide on which answers are hardest and place the most scoring chips on the hardest answer.  This is because if the players do not hit some or any of the answers provided on the game card, the Card Reader will win the scoring chips leftover and advance on the Board.   However, if the players hit all or any of the answers on the game card, they win the scoring chips for the correct answers provided.  I really like the strategy part of the game, it adds a good deal of spice.  BONKERS provided for an entertaining evening.  We will play again!

I love this playpen!! Durable plastic, can be extended to larger size (or shortened if going someplace that is not as large). Only problem is that my baby loves to "wander." She is not thrilled when Mommy "cages" her up in order to protect her while I make dinner and cannot watch her as closely as necessary. Crib toys can be safely attached on the sides (did that with her Aquarium toy, which she loves and it soothes her). Occasionally plays with music buttons and phone but nothing else seems to interest her. I just put her other toys in for her to play with

I bought this mostly for the container.  I had individual play-doh products, like the barber set that came in it's own box.  I'm able to put ALL play-doh things into this container and everything is in one spot.  No more boxes and sorting.  I even still have space for more things like different colors and everything.  My daughter loves the variety of the toys and I love the convenience.  I'm going to buy it for presents for other families I know!

These dominos are great for the hello kitty lover.  My six year old loves them.  Don't be fooled by the picture though, the tin is not full.  If you ask me, there are not enough of them in there.  The tin is filled about three quarters with plastic to hold the dominoes up in the window and make it look full.  I would have rated it five stars if it had been full

We use this travel turtle on the airplane and in the car for my 1- and 2-year old children. It's intended for children a little older, and I can see why, as they are not able to easily balance the turtle on their laps. However, my 2-year-old can use it by herself, and it helped her to have a flat place to color and play with her magnetic board toys. I had to hold it in place for my 1-year-old, but when doing so, it also allowed him to color. I would recommend it, especially for children 3 and up.

I'm not one for guns in my household, but my potty-training son really wanted this blaster gun. He's a total Star Wars fan (like his father) and I told him that he could have it if he said good-bye to diapers. He did. So we ordered it and waited for the UPS man to come. He was so excited when it was delivered. He thought the UPS man was so cool for giving that to him! Anyways, there is so much detail on this blaster gun. The sounds are pretty cool and it lights up red. My son loves the sight scope too! Big hit in our household!!!

I have read other reviews here that this table is too high for 2 and 3 year olds. Maybe so but, it is wonderful for 4-5 year olds! Those "in between stages" kids who want to have a small table of their own but, need something a bit taller and more sturdy than those made for toddlers. My son (almost 5) and his big sister (7) can both sit together and eat a snack at this table. It is very sturdy! The small drawer is great for crayons or stickers to be put out of the way at snack time. The surface of the table is just the right size for imaginative play with puzzles or action figures. The unique oval shape of the table takes up less room while still providing a good sized table top surface space. My son had outgrown 2 "child size" table and chair sets by age 4- most are actually buit for toddlers- this table is actually for "Kids" and it has been a big hit at our home. Guess who's getting the matching Lifestyle kitchen for Christmas

The only draw back of this toy as others have said is the arms are stiff and make it hard to hug..

Other than that, this toy is simply adorable , the motorized sound of movements are hardly noticable.. and the sounds it makes are truly neat. My daughter got this over a year ago, (she is 7 now) and she still loves this bear and we have not had any problems with any broken limbs.

Ever since my son was 10 months old he just HAD to check out the vacuum whenever it was out. So we decided to get him a toy vacuum for his birthday. Since we use a canister vacuum I wanted to get him a canister vacuum as well, and this was pretty much the only one out there. 

He just LOVES it, and since he is under 3, (the recommended age), I took the long gray pole out of the vacuum so its just his size. (the head fits fine straight onto the hose.) He knows how to turn it on & off, but mostly likes dragging it around. He also likes taking the two attachments out. And I love how this vacuum has no real suction because then it would not be safe for my little one. 

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because he loves this toy so much that he wants to drag it EVERYWHERE. And that can be a pain- (to the car, in the highchair, on the changing table, etc.) so I've had to hide it sometimes. :) But I am very happy with this vacuum

I love this motorcycle and it is a "no-duh" that it doesn't run on fuel.  Really...think...what fuel are you going to use.  Plus, fuel is hazardous to children and a company wouldn't threaten the lives of innocent children!  That's my OPINION

My 9 year old son loves Dragon Mountain.  He wasn't able to assemble it alone; eventhough he's typically very good at assembling most other toys.  It took about an hour for him and his dad to assemble it...but he felt it was more than worth the time it took to put it together

We are loving this set!  Very cool dragons, a fun environment for characters to explore and fight in.  Extra fun from several moving features - rasing/lowering cauldron, tramcar on sloped tracks, erupting mountain top, opening dragon mouth, flapping dragon wings, firing cannon.

A little challenging to build, but the instructions are fairly clear.  Assembly took an adult about 3 relaxed hours.  

A few sections come apart after some play but they are pretty easy to put back together.  So far no pieces have broken.

Most important, this is a lot of fun to play with.  Over the past two days, our set has been getting non-stop play from a 9 year old boy and 6 year old girl.  A great toy for two kids to play with together, and the boy says a single child could also spend hours happily playing by himself.

We wouldn't have paid the full retail price for this, but at $35 (Amazon discounted price), I think this is appropriate value.

These 'Cars' characters are all quality die-cast replicas that kids young and not so young can enjoy. The kids love playing with them and so far, our 'cast members' are still intact.
But they do look so good you might want to put one on your desk...

The details: painless shopping and quick shipping, as usual on Amazon

I first purchased the Winnie the Pooh Soft 'n Silly Tigger for my son when he was 4 months old.  He is now 14 months and LOVES his Tigger.  We now have 2 Tiggers, one as a back up, and he carries them everywhere he goes.  It's a great toy for young children to sleep with, being soft and cuddly.  Tigger has been a great comfort for my son and I don't know what I would have done with out them!

I wasn't so sure if he was ready for the puzzle at the age of 3, but four months after his birthday together with his cousins he started putting the pieces together. He is now 3.5 yrs. and knows how to complete it all by himself within less than 10min. I give ten stars

Previous reviews listed the lack of volume control as a negative point. In a panic I ran to check the three I have purchased for Christmas gifts 2002. ALL three have volume controls now! Don't let reviews on a previous model keep you from purchasing these products. Friends have these and my girls begged for their own. As a home-schooling mom I prefer to buy toys that are both fun and educational - Leap Frog is my best source

The game of memory is a great equalizer because little children are just as apt to remember where they saw the hidden images as older children or adults.  This makes it great game for the whole family to play together.   The images from the &quot;I Spy&quot; book illustrations are bright and  creative.  They don't match exactly- for instance, there might be two  images of cats, but borrowed from different photographs in the I Spy books.   So there is a bit more visual variety to spice things up.  This is a much  more attractive memory game than most, and would make an ideal gift for a  child or family

I just purchased this redesigned AT-ST from a local retail store. For the basic price of $20 for 244 pieces, this set is well worth the price. 

I purchased the original AT-ST years ago and this model far surpasses that one in all ways. It's larger, much more stable, and has a unique pivoting mechanism which rotates the cab. It was very difficult to get the original AT-ST to stand upright without falling over; the 7657 is extremely stable. 

The original AT-ST had Chewbacca at the controls which was pretty cool. However, not as cool as the AT-ST driver that has a new helmet and blaster. The only drawback is that his minifig head is flesh colored instead of traditional LEGO yellow.

It took about 20 minutes to put the model together. It wasn't very challenging but interesting to see how the rotating mechanism was put together. 

I would highly recommend purchasing this set. For the low price of $20 for such a detailed and complete set, it's well worth the price. You won't be disappointed

I bought this toy because Amamzon's price was a great bargin compared to other stores.  I would have given this product 5 stars but gave it only 4 because the can is so large and the lincoln logs only fill is maybe half way.  There is a lot more room for more logs.  115 sounds like a lot but you are only able to make the one cabin seen on the front.  I ended up buying additional logs (not lincoln logs) so that me and the kids could build additional buildings and a fence

I was very happy with the Lincoln Logs I ordered for my three year old grandson. He has been enjoying them. They seem to be more complicated than they were when my son was his age which was about 35 years ago or close to it. Then it was only one small log cabin but this set is a western building. My grandson has still been able to build something that he likes. Thank you for making it available

I recently bought this Read With Me DVD System after much hesitation from other reviews. It was on sale at Toy r' Us for $18 so I decided that I would go ahead and try it. I took the advice of one of the reviewers and waited until my daughter went to bed to program it.  To be honest, it took me longer to get it out of the package than to program it. The system was programmed in less than 5 minutes and I have a Pioneer DVD player that is over 5 years old. The only thing I would suggest besides waiting until you child is asleep is not to lay the DVD control perfectly flat or it will be lower than the eye on the Read with Me DVD system.  My daughter absolutely loved it! The reason I gave it 4 out of 5 is because wish they had a few more DVD available in stores.

Ok so my son got it for christmas and here it is june and i just hooked it up. it took me all of 5 mintutes not even that to program it. the first try #4 wouldnt take so what i did is i put the toy remote on one thigh and the remote on the other so that there were almost touching and so that the "eyes" were right on top of each other. and it took straight away. 

Its really fun for my 4 year old my 10 year old got bored. my only suggestion is that there needs to be a bigger choice of games. they are so similar that my 4 year old changes games quite a bit.

i am actually having trouble finding games for it now.

its great and if they are going to be in front of the TV might as well be learning. he also hase VSMILE which is a little bit better if you can afford the 60$ for the game unit and 20$ for the games. (grandma and grandpa got ours for us with games) so it wasnt bad for us. 

read with me DVD is good though, i really enjoy playing it and listening to the stories

My children are 7, 5 and 20 months, and they all love it.  The baby is especially fascinated by it and was able to make the top spin by herself after her brothers coached her a bit.  The humming sound is much less annoying the many of their battery operated toys with voices and electronic noises

my 19 month old loves the toy for its colors, I like it because it allows me to get more chores finished in the kitchen! It has a nice suction base to keep the top steady on tile. It was a little difficult at first, for my son to handle, since a good bit of strength is needed to push the bar down especially if you want to hear it hum and spin fast. The colors are pretty cool, The faster it spins the more colors come out (primary + yellow/orange colors). I like that it holds his interest. A [...] could defentley get this down better but at least there is room to grow!

If you love the unpredictable, then Catch 22 is for you.  This game has plenty of social interaction and combines skill with luck in the pursuit of 22 gold tokens.  Just when I thought I was about to win the game, my boyfriend landed on my game piece and stole all of my tokens.  Boy, that did not make me happy at all.  The key to this game is to use your blocker cubes wisely.  The cubes are used to either block an opponents way or safeguard your path to the money.  Once you use the cubes, you can only retrieve them by landing on a 'collect blocker' square.  You can collect any blocker cube placed on the board, including your opponent's cubes.  I made lots of money selling blocker cubes back to my opponents. We were so addicted to this game that we played it all night long.  I highly recommend it, but be prepared to either win big or lose your shirt!

I especially like this product for traveling and sitting in waiting rooms. My only complaint is that you have to hold it just right to see the puzzle clearly on the screen.  It has a contrast adjustment, but it not very helpful.  It also has a lighted screen option which is not very good either. A great improvement would be a screen with greater contrast.

It's her house for her and her dolls. My neice is also enjoying her Dora house. Great gift. It does not  take up too much space. You can slide it under a bed, behind a couch etc. Dora house is great!

My 4 year old son got some early christmas money from his grandparents. So we went and bought this toy at Target (and paid 30.09 for it) He loves it... his favorite part was that you can take the whole thing apart and put it together different each time. My only concern was that the snow monster needs camera batteries or cell phone batteries??? What are those??

Many people are not time oriented.  I have used this both in the classroom and at home.  It allows the children a visual clue to how much time has gone past.  I tell them they have 30 minutes to complete something.  I set green for 20, yellow for 7, and red for 3.  I don't have to say anything else.  This eliminates waiting time once they realize that at red they need to be picking up and getting ready for the next lesson

My three year old takes a "rest" instead of a nap, which means he stays in his room for a quiet time so mommy has some sanity.  He can't tell time, so he would come out every 5 minutes to see if rest time was over.  In order to keep him in there for an hour I purchased this clock so he can see and hear when his time was up.  It works perfectly and he isn't anxious about when his time is up.  He understood the concept of the clock changing from green to yellow to red quickly and knows when the clock is red that his time is almost up. I set the clock to announce when his time is up and then he comes on out. No more "is it time yet?".  I get my full hour of sanity uninterupted!

We wanted this little doll for our own "Little Ariel". She is perfect for the bath tub! She comes with her own float, wand with bath tints, and swim coverup!! Her bright red hair is put in little pig tails with bows and she has a baby powder fresh scent (which we were not expecting- my husband is not to found of that). We are very pleased and hope that this company continues to make baby princess items!!!

I love it! it's really light weight and portble.  The batteries do go dead without the charger and the PVDs should have more then 30 minutes-60minutes.  I like this video now alot.  Calling it a toy is a little far fetched but it's wonderful.  I hope you buy it!

We all LOVE this toy.  What I like about it, is that it's easy to use, even for my almost three yr old, it has realistic sounds yet not obnoxious, it's sturdy, (Will only tip when it knocks into something pretty hard) it LOOKS good, not cheap, and it's pretty wallet friendly as far as price goes.

This has been THE big hit this Christmas.  Even more so than Tekno Puppy

My 11 yr old son got these Moon Shoes at Christmas and he plays with them a lot.  He has ADHD and Sensory Integrative Dysfunction, and the bouncing really soothes him and gets him refocused.  I don't think he ever expected to bounce very high; he seems to be happy enough with the bounce he gets.  When he wants to play with them in the house, I send him downstairs to jump around on the concrete floor to save wear and tear on my hardwoods.

The downside for us has been that the bands have started snapping very frequently.  At the rate he's going, he'll run out of bands long before he outgrows wanting to play with the toy.  So if anyone hears of a way to get more bands, please speak up

My 8-year old wanted a pirate ship for Christmas, which was a dilemma because all I could find were ships for toddlers or LEGO-related ships.  This one is fully assembled (PHEW!) and when he opened the box, he jumped for joy.  The 4 action figures have the sinister look an 8-yr old could appreciate.  The cannon really shoots and the hoist loads and unloads treasures.  My son found enough small removable parts on the ship (a parrot, tools, anchor, lamps) to keep him occupied for hours.  The whole ship is hard or molded plastic, including the sails.  I'm fairly confident it will hold up in many future battles.  I'm VERY happy with this ship, but I wouldn't recommend it to a toddler or a child who looses small objects

This review is not about the toy, but about the service you can expect to receive from Amazon.com.  If you are buying this as a gift, only do so if you have months to wait, even if the item is listed as available.  Amazon.com will allow you to pay your money under the guise of sending your items, and then days later, inform you of a delay in shipping, and then a week later inform you the item has just shipped and can take up to an additional 10 days for delivery.  Despite the site's claims that the item would ship in 24hrs and be delivered in 3-5 days.  Mind you, they're sending it via UPS or American Home....
Honestly, there are other retailers out there who are more reliable than Amazon.com and I strongly recommend using them - unless you're okay disappointing the little girl in your life.  I know I hate having to tell my neice that the gift I promised her still won't be there - even though her birthday has passed, by almost a week at this poin

My daughter is 2 1/2 years old and I often find myself surrounded by some loud toys that jingle or sing.  After dinner I find that this book is a wonderful transition into our bedtime routine.  She has learned how to button, use a zipper and problem solve by using this book.  Also, I find that this is a great toy to keep in the car when rush hour traffic becomes horrible.  I have bought this book for many of my friends children and would recommend this to anyone who has a toddler since the it holds up extremelly well no matter how hard your child plays with it

Our whole family loves this game.  I like this version because it includes the history and rules of the game on the inside cover.  I also like that you can close the cover and not lose the dice.  The construction is a little flimsy and there is not enough felt on the board which makes the dice rolling a little noisy.  We added a piece of felt on top of the board and it is much better

These days, classic game shows aren't really as popular as reality shows like Survivor and American Idol. However, with the surprise Summer show, Game Show Marathon in CBS, many clssics had the opportunity to breathe a glimpse of new life, like Press Your Luck, Match Game, and Card Sharks. Another classic which was revised, Let's Make A Deal. With Monty Hall's benchmark into pop culture revisted, many have wondered whether the classic game of trading will ever come back onto television again. Thankfully, those who easily own DVD actually don't have to wait for the show to return. They can just trade in the comforts of their own living room.

The Let's Make A Deal DVD game, recaptures the classic trading that Monty Hall made popular from the 70's and 80's into a great fun game. In this game, Monty Hall puts traders to the test where you can trade your chances for big nostalgic prizes like classic cars from Datsun, and Cadillac, to trips and fur coats from Dicker & Dicker of Beverly Hills. On top of that, there are classic quick deals to play for extra cash. For example, if you have a pair of scissors, Monty will give you $700. Also, there are the classic booby prizes, Zonks!!! Although they are fun to receive, you get absolutely nothing to show for it. There is also the anticipation of getting the Big Deal for big bucks. Unlike DVD editions of shows like Family Feud and The Price Is Right, the game really delivers a great job from Monty, and each of the great concepts from the classic game show. The mastering really thrives with classic clips of Carol Merill and Deal's announcer Jay Stewart on each of the prizes.

Although I just wish there could've been more games to play, I am absolutely impressed with the way Let's Make A Deal was put into a DVD game. If you haven't seen this classic game show, Monty Hall hosted, you have to buy this great game. I absolutely recommend this, and that is definitely not a zonk!

Price: B 1/2-

DVD Mastering: A-

Fun & Enjoyment: B 1/2+

Overall: B

I bought my seven and ten year old daughters moon shoes for christmas.  I had read all the reviews, so I immediately instructed the girls to always wear their bicycle helmets when playing with their moon shoes.  

Yes, they can be dangerous, but with a few precautions, I think the kids will have more fun, be safer, and the parents will have peace of mind.

1. Don't let the kids start jumping right away, hold their hand or have them put their hand on your shoulder as they practice walking in them.

2.  Once they've achieved the ability to balance, have them practice bouncing in place just a little bit.  This will help them learn to balance as they move and learn how the moon shoes respond to the way they move.

3. Set ground rules, no bouncing when there is a lot of debris around, no bouncing while holding objects, always wear helmet, no bouncing near each other, and if you feel or hear any of the rubber bands break while bouncing sit down immediately and take off the shoes.

My kids spent the first half hour/45 minutes getting use to their moon shoes.  They now can bounce around with stability and confidence

The gizmo doll is very realistic. It looks just like the one in the movie. The doll's ears are about 11 inches across and the doll is about 8 inches tall. I bet your going to really like this Plush Gizmo Doll, my son treats him like a member of the family. Thank you for reading

both of my kids have a LeapPad and several books ... this is a great way to keep them all together.  It's durable and kid friendly--so they can keep track of their cartridges and books ... and it's great b/c they can just grab it and go which makes it nice for travel too

We bought the LeapPad Plus for our 4 year old for Christmas and 4 books to go along with it.  Then I realized we had no where to put it, we also bought the Littletouch leadpad for our 1 year old and a bunch of books.  Yesterday we went and bought this and the carry case for our little one's littletouch.  Great space saver.  It is made very well too.  Our daughter calls it her briefcase.  It fits everything perfectly

This movie teaches the basic ballet steps with the use of a mat.  Although it is a little slow in the beginning, once the dancing starts my daughter is hooked.  We started with with a VHS and had to buy a dvd because we played the video so much.

My grandparents bought me this for Christmas and I really love it! The doll is absolutely breathtaking, and she has honey blond hair with golden highlights. Her eyes are a deep blue green color, and she is very pretty overall. The closet she comes with is very cute, and I can put Barbie shirts and skirts on the little hangers! There is a lot of room for shoes and purses and hair accessories, I love this toy

My son got this game as a gift.  I brought it into my junior high classroom to use on a game day.  The kids love this game and request it over and over.  Many other teachers have asked to borrow it for their classes.  It is a great vocabulary builder.  I also made my own cards with letters of the alphabet on them.  I use these when we are studying parts of speech --  they have to come up with a noun (adjective, verb, etc) that begins with that letter.  This is a great game and a good way to make a rather dull subject more interesting

My 3 3/4 yr old got these for Christmas and he loves them.  Plays with them almost every day.  We bought both dinosaur kits and they are fun to combine together.  My son loves to not only put together the "proper" dinosaurs, but make up his own creatures as well.  A fun way for dinosaur loving kids to engage in some creative "think outside the box" play

The little mermaid pop-up castle was sold out everywhere this past holiday season selling at $34.99.  I found it on Amazon for $26.47 and free shipping!
My daugher, 3 yrs old, just loves it.  The accessories are very tiny, like the tea pot and tea cups.  Tiny like your pinky fingernail.  
We all love it! Easy to put together, but I think it folds up, I don't know how though

We bought this pool toy for our daughter, and she was thrilled!!! But after being on this toy one time we now call him the bucking bull. Good luck staying on the silly thing. Now my child sits and hangs on to the handles and we pull her around the pool on it. My husband and I cannot stay on this thing either. Every now and then we bail on with sheer determination, only to be off in a matter of seconds

The remote on this car has nice big buttons that are easy for my two year old to use.  One button makes the car go forward and one turns it around.  The third just makes reving engine & squealing tire sounds. Not very realistic but convincing enough for a toddler.  This car has been tossed around and dropped yet still looks and works great.  It is a very durable toy that is simple to use.  It is a great first remote control car.

We learned about these blocks years ago when my now 13 year old was in pre-school.  I was amazed at how these seemingly simple pieces of wood, so totally enraptured these little kids!  
Kapla, are 'blocks' that are all exactly the same size.  At first glance, they seem boring.  But once you start playing with them, they are so much more.  They can be made into all kinds of structures, and can even be raised higher than one can reach, without falling!!
When our 'surprise blessing' turned 2, I pulled them out for him.  He enjoyed them (though at 3 he likes them much more), but what surprised me is that my older two (15 and 13) love playing with them as well!!  In fact, we ALL do!!  
I know it seems like a lot of money to spend on these, but they are MORE than worth it!

My daughter thinks these are the most adorable Fairies.  They adorn every possible accessory she and her friends can attach them to.  You never know who will have which charms as they are always swapping them.  I would say that you get an amazing bang for your buck with these.  They are the "in" thing right now with her 4th grade friends

This thing is great. Anything you can put on top of it to hold it down will stage it up to go off. It will blow up and not hurt anyone but scare them...funny funny funny!!!! You can use fairly light objects, you can use trip cords, and you can use trip cord like devices too, and probably much more that I have never thought of... Good luck, good fun, and good hunting!

I bought this for my grandson for Christmas, he was 8 months old. This has been the best learning toy for him, along with entertainment. He has learned how the shapes work and took this on soon. It has also helped him in walking. It is entertaining for me to watch him play with this toy, he has to push the button and play the music before he pushes it. I would actually buy one more for him to have at home with Mom and Dad. This is well worth the money

We love this game. It seems to be the most fun with 5 or 6 people, although my husband and I also enjoyed the 2-person version.
We do not usually use the board. We just use a scorepad to keep track of points.
Once you catch on to the game, it's not too hard to come up with answers.
Highly recommended

I received this for my 3 yr old daughter and she absolutely loves it.  The price is great right now, especially with free shipping.
She loves to dress the doll and use all the accessories.  More than worth the low price...I'm going to stock up on a few more for misc. gifts.  The package is large and comes with a lot of accessories

Unavailable for some time, the Sky High Suspension Bridge is back.  Once you have the ramps to get the track up there, it really stands out as a part of the railroad.

Assembly was required but routine; the directions were quite adequate.  There are no stickers to wiggle into place

I've had this high chair for a year now, and I love it.  My daughter plays with it every day, and it's worn great.  It still looks as good as the day we put it together.  I love that it's wood, rather than cheap plastic, and it's a pretty white with pink gingham, which I think is adorable.  The material has held up great and still looks perfect.  The wood is sturdy, with no cracks.  It fits all my daughter's dolls, including her large Cabbage Patch doll.  If I were going to change anything, I'd like a little bar in the front of the seat that would prevent the babies from slipping through (like real high chairs).  For the most part, her babies stay put, but sometimes they slip down and out.  It's not a big problem, though.  Our friends bought the same one a year ago for their daughter, and feel the same way about it.  We love the Badger Basket product line!  I highly recommend this product

Another nice product from PlayDough.
Worth the ten bucks or so..  We just bought this from 
Amazon.  This would make a cute birthday present for a young child, say 2 to 8?  Hard to give an age as I myself like to sit with my son and play!
Enough play dough for the price and the bucket is really handy for storage.  I would buy this again as a gift

I bought my Harvey toy a while ago, and I was quite pleased. It's actually very durable, like everyone else has said. The crane doesn't break off, no matter how often you play with it or how hard you may accidentaly step on it. I think the only way to break it off is via steam roller.

Anyway, highly recommended for any Thomas collector

Being the first Ravensburger puzzle I have ever owned, it is without a doubt the best quality and the best detailed puzzle I have ever worked with.

The quality of the product is shown throughout, from the sturdy container, practically sediment free packaging, the exact cuttings of the each puzzle piece (not a single one was still attached to another puzzle piece and there were only one or two frayed cut spots in the whole set), and the high quality graphic printing.

The puzzle itself is made difficult primarily by the use of similar colors throughout.  The puzzle pieces are otherwise the standard cut type.

The resulting artwork is something that we've decided to actually frame and hang in my office, which we have never done over the years (puzzles can be very calming to work on after a long week of long and stressful work hours - especially when working on them with others).  The puzzle cuts are so well done that it is not entirely easy for someone to tell that it is a puzzle from general glancing unless they get up close (within 2 feet) and look at the detail.

I will definitely buy more Ravensburger puzzles and hope that they come out with even more puzzles of this type (old world maps) and same quality

An excellent project for your child's school report.  We purchased the Velociraptor kit for our 8 year old daughter not knowing what to expect. After opening the package my wife came up with the clever idea of pouring melted chocolate chips into the dinosaur molds, instead of using the plaster mix that comes with the kit. We experimented with white chocolate chips and created realistic looking dinosaur bones! We buried these edible bones in ground up Oreo Cookies.  What a thrill to see our daughter's 2nd grade class excavate these delectible prehistoric fossils!  We can't wait to purchase other kits in the Eyewitness series

When the Toa and all the first Bionicles came out, it was very simple and straigthforward. Bad guys were different from the Toa and everyone knew they were bad. Now, with the Pirahka, we have villians claiming to be Toa! And the matoran believe them!

One of the things I really love about Zaktan is his weapon. It looks really cool and can change. Also, the little ball launcher (I forget what it's called) is a lot of fun (I shot my brother with it X3) and the glowing eyes are just plain awesome! Though the rubber part is sligthy annoying, it doesn't really get in the way

As a brilliant, but ruthless leader of the Piraka, Zaktan thinks that working together is the way to find the ultimate treasure, the mask of life! All the Piraka have two tools. Yes, 2. Each one has a Zamor spheres which are small marbles that each one can shoot, but in real life they would be the size of basketballs. Zaktan's three-pronged blade is capable of cutting through metal. Nothing will get in his way, or it will be severely punished................

I think this toy is just too cute.  It is a bit pricey though.  I would not suggest you purchase this toy for a young toddler...maybe a 2 1/2 to 3 year old.  My daughter likes throwing it on the ground and screaming with delight (she is one and a half).  She really likes it and carries it around the house.  She is a little too young to respect it properly and I fear it may not last long.  It is really cute if you have real stainless steal appliances in your home.  I bought this because my daughter has taken a keen interest in my microwave and I have trouble keeping her away from it.  This toy has solved that problem.  One minus is that it came with no instructions on how to get the table to rotate.  You have to play with the buttons a little and then you will see how it operates.  My daughter can not systematically make the turn table rotate...for her it happens randomly.  She enjoys opening the doors, pushing the buttons, seeing the light come on and hiding her real dinner in there (so parents beware!).  Someone suggested it is a tiny unit...and so it is, but all the other toy microwaves I looked at were very similar in size

I bought this doll w/ brunette hair for my 4 year old.  It's so soft and realistic looking, floppy like a real newborn, perfect weight for little ones to cradle.  I'd been looking for a 'baby' doll w/ long hair - some of the other co's make them too heavy, not conducive for real play.  This doll is also washable, a big plus.  The hair is soft and very brushable, the face is sweet and the eyes open and close properly.  A little pricier than your average doll but you can see the difference in the skin texture and facial features. Overall a very nice doll, high quality, hopefully will be played w/ for many years.

My son loves this instrument, but I think he likes another saxophone that plays tunes when you press buttons better. This one relies on the child to blow and press the keys, like a real instrument, but doesn't sound like a saxophone

we saw this online and really wanted it, but decided to wait because of the reviews. well today we went to an outlet store that sells new stuff at huge discount prices, and it was only 10.00 my son has already ridden the heck out of it with no problems, and he loves it. we havent had to replace a fuse and it just the right size for my 1 and a half year old. its a really great little bike, but for the workmanship of it, i definitly wouldnt pay 50 dollars for it, maybe 30-35 most. we just got blessed with a really great deal:) so if ya want this for your kids, its great for the smaller rider, and just the right speed for him to control. hope this helps someone:

My family of seven kids, four daughters/sons-in-law have owned this game for 2 years.  We love playing it and it is one of the few games that everyone enjoys.  It is one of our favorite games and that is saying a lot since we own dozens of games.  Our youngest was 12 when we bought the game and she often wins

I've been thrilled with the car so far.  Super fast, and super cheap at this price.  It could be a little more responsive when turning, but otherwise great.  Lasted about 25mins with long fast runs using a generic 9.6v pack by newbright.  As other person said, works better on packed surfaces vs loose dirt and grass.  I bought it to bring back memories of my old Tyco turbo hopper from childhood...and it did a great job at that.

My son likes this item.  The cars also fit his train set from imaginarium.  The only thing I didn't like about putting this together was the elevator.  Very tight fit and doesn't like to go up or down easily.  But everyone likes playing with it, from the 18 mo old to the 10 year olds

We purchased a starter piece set for my girl when she was 3 years old. She absolutely loved it because it was easy to use and build. She had a hard time with the legos type blocks because it was more frustrating for her to pull them apart. We then expanded to this 35 piece and she is able to be even more creative. It is an excellent lerning toy. not as simple as it seems

This doll rocks! I love her hair, it's a dark reddish color and it's curled into seperate locks. And her dress is gorgeous! It's a powder pink color with long sleeves, and at the hands it has a big ball of white feathers. The necklece she has is very pretty, and so is her crown. Shes quite durable, and would make a great addition to any collection or toy chest

My daughter is one and a half, and she's had these blocks for about a year now, but only now is she really playing with them and identifying the little pictures.  Some pictures are a little obscure, but all the basic animals and objects seem to be covered.  I'm very pleased with how smooth the blocks are, and how well they are holding up.  I feel they will really help my daughter to learn her letters, both in upper and lower case.  My only problem is with the tray.  It only holds the blocks if you keep it completely flat (as if a toddler can transport anything while keeping it level).  I also don't like its sharp edges.  My daughter went through a phase where she liked dumping the blocks out and then waving the tray around.  Now the tray is stored out of reach and the blocks are stored in a small plastic bin

Murdoch is a mighty engine with ten drive wheels. He was brought to the Island to help with the heavy workload and pull freight on the main line. As shy as he is strong, Murdoch can often be found seeking peace and quiet. 

This wooden train is a 2 piece set, joined with magnets. My son loves playing with this mustard-yellow engine on his wooden tracks. Very sturdy construction, and a great addition to the Thomas line

This action figure is sitting on my desk at home. He's my little computer buddy. It's really not bad at all, although the plastic hair doesn't allow his head to move very much. When I'm writing, and I get to a point where I need to back off a bit, I pick him up and change the pose, or threaten my daughter with the masamune, or she and I set him up for a couple of humourous pics. It's great.

All hail Sephi!!  (and you can just hear it, Why the heck are you calling me that?   Well, why not?  It's weird and it's not right!  But, Sephi....)

Hahahaha. Can't wait to get Cloud too. Then things in my house will be interesting

This is a fabulous little Brio bridge.  My kids (6, 3 & 2 yrs) all love this as part of their train track.  It is a sturdy piece which gets used daily.  My kids love that they can drive the train onto the bridge and then push the button that collapses the bridge and have the train (mostly this is Diesel 10) fall down.  It's a reenactment of the viaduct scene from Thomas and the Magic Railroad movie

I probably play over a hundred games of Solitaire a night.  I have a hard time sleeping but this game, after playing as many as I do, makes me go to sleep.  I haven't read a book in over two months which to me is remarkable because I have read at night ever since Junior High.  I am now 62 and playing Solitaire.  Thank goodness for it

This is a great puppet theater, sound stage, restaurant, play house, etc...  My daughter was 4 when she received this from Santa.  He only wished he had found it sooner!  My daughter continues to love it, and will now be sharing it with her younger sister.  Many hours of pretend have been spent inside and outside this theater.  We especially love it because it is large enough inside for two or more children.  All the others we researched were too small for our needs.  The colors are so vibrant and fun, we get tons of compliments from all our company.  All the kids gravitate towards it

I love this puzzle! It is fun and challenging. I believe that it is a good puzle for anyone who wants a challenge. However I find that there is one problem with it. THERE ARE NO DIMENSIONS TO TELL YOU HOW BIG THE PUZZLE IS AFTER YOU PUT IT TOGRTHER!!! I would appreciate it if dimensions were added to the box. I am sure that anyone else who purchases this puzzle would appreciate it to so that they know if they are going to have to purchase a puzzle mat as well if they order this puzzle. If you like puzzles that are not your everyday puzzle I would recommend that you purchase this puzzle because it would make a worthy addition to any puzzle collection

I understand the people who install car seats who feel this item isn't needed and distrust its lack of crash testing, but my infant car seats are hand-me-downs without LATCH.  My car has LATCH, but does not seem to have the kind of seat belts that stay tight.  My car seat doesn't just get a little loose... you can move it 4 or 5 inches side to side if you try.  It may be that a car seat tech could train me to do a better job with the locking clip, but I can't get it to stop this.  And one of the seats was given to me without a locking clip at all.  I have no problem tightening the seat belt enough - it just won't stay that way.

This product allows me to tighten the car seat enough to meet the "one inch" spec.  Nothing else has.  So it definitely adds to my baby's safety.

Finally- to the car seat techs- with the number of these that have been sold, it doesn't appear that anyone has come forward to say that it failed in a crash.  Just because it hasn't been crash-tested does not mean it is unsafe.  And there is absolutely nothing wrong with aftermarket goods as a rule, tho manufacturers will ALWAYS tell you otherwise

I purchased this item when my daughter was one year old, and it was amazing!  My daughter was always a good sleeper, but when she began teething at around 9-10 months old, she began refusing to stay in her crib each night.  I was out of ideas, and my husband and I had tried just about every method we read about without success. Finally, I found the Tomy Star Bright Light, and it was like a miracle worker!  The first night I used it, my daughter put herself to sleep in her crib by staring at the ceiling.  Each night, her sleeping became better and better.  Now, we only run it once for 10 minutes and she falls asleep.  It is a much better approach then allowing your child to "cry it out".  She actually enjoys going to sleep now and looks forward to watching the light show before she falls asleep.

We bought this puzzle for my then 2 year old as he had mastered the barn puzzle (which is also amazing).  There are monkeys, tigers, butterflies, and numerous other jungle animals.  I had to look up several of the animals as I was not sure of what they were.  This was a good educational experience for both me and my son.  This puzzle is durable as are all of the M&D floor puzzles.  It has been stepped on and thrown across the room by a highly rambunctions child.  I have had this puzzle for over a year, and it looks great.  I rotate this puzzle with the other Melissa and Doug floor puzzzles that we have.  I recommend any of their floor puzzles as they are great quality and have easy to handle pieces for kids.  They are a great opportunity to teach about different subjects and teach new words to children

I bought this for my 4 1/2 yr old daughter for xmas and she was extremely impressed along with myself.  It's exactly like the "real thing" just smaller! Very durable, colorful, and fun! It's great to use with the Zapf Creation dolls that tend to weigh more than a smaller baby doll b/c the car seat is so sturdy. Unlike most car seats this doesn't collapse and fold up whenever you actually try to carry it by the handle! It is definately worth the price

You might be disappointed if you were expecting the exact same thing as the original 1984 Optimus Prime toy (or wanted a trailer for the truck), but this is an updated version of the original character, as opposed to a remake, and is superior in many ways. It is durable, detailed, well-articulated, and fun, especially with the truck parts forming weapons for the robot. I'd recommend it for kids and nostalgic adults alike

This product is not the best ever created, as the Roxxi doll that comes with it is not the prettiest of Bratz dolls. She has huge black and red streaks in her hair, as well as an oddly-shaped head. However, one gets used to her and can even find her pretty. The stage itself is a great product, but plugging it in to your stereo is more confusing than you might think. This playset comes with a microphone that is different from the regular Rock Angelz microphone, as it is gray and of a different style. Also included is a faux-snakeskin chair, Roxxi, a guitar, and a few accessories, like bottled water and make up compacts. The stage itself is rather nice, and I strongly suggest the Instrumentz if you buy this. However, be warned that it is not the BEST of Bratz products, despite its appeal. It's rather nice, though. :

I love this nativity even though it I think it is pricey.  There are no other ones like it.  They are Fisher Price Little People so you know they will hold up forever!  There aren't any other plastic nativity sets out there. Get the set that plays the song when you place the angel on top of the stable. It is so worth the price when you know they will play with it every year. I even take this to church when I teach my 3and4yr old class about Jesus birth.  They LOVE it

My 5 and 7 year olds have gotten a lot of use out of this toy. It is a strong microphone and seems to be made very well. They love to pretend to be rock stars! My only complaint about the toy is there is no volume control.... so you only get one level...LOUD. I would recommend it for any child that likes to sing

I don't understand why they are so offensive to people. I am Christian, and I lvoe all three Midnight Dance dolls. I think they are more 'Phantom of the Opera' than 'Sadistic Satinist'.
Meygan is my favorite, but Yasmin is still beautiful. These dolls are gourgeous

I bought this play tent for my 15-month old daughter for Christmas.  She loves going through the curtain entrances and plays peek a boo through the little window.  She's a little rough on the door, not realizing the door opens outward.  But she's a little young still to understand the full extent of the play tent.  All in all, worth the money

Nuparu is SWEET! But, sadly, his skull does not glow in the dark. Nuparu has black/gray armor, a light up sword with a strobe effect, two claws, and a Zamor sphere launcher attached to his back. You must be careful with the zamor spheres, though, because they're easy to lose. Now I have Toa Matoro and Toa Nuparu! YOU HAVR TO BUY THIS TOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Damn! I just got the yostick and took it to the local gym and streets to demo some new tricks.  At first I had some doubts about the durability of it but after some heavy duty urban testing, it's still mad tricking.  In other words, I've been trying pretty hard to break it.  For it's price, the yostick is incredible fun.  In an age of pricey video-games, $10.99 is not a high price for something that provides exercise, fun and an introduction to the movement and breathing rhythms of martial arts.  A value-priced training tool, not a toy at all.  The movement required by the yostick will help martial arts beginners have fun while learning precise hand-eye controls.  The ends are fitted with rubber tips making it a joy to trick directly off the ground.  Looking forward to collecting other models. Enjoy It

My friends and I, all in college, are major movie buffs, so when another friend told me about the game, I was eager to try it.  Some parts are tough, but with the team setup of the game, it seems to even out.  Favourite rounds were Still Crazy: a round where scenes are built piece by piece, a word association round: 6 clues are provided and the idea is to name the movie, and the quotes round, of course!  The hardest rounds were the matching and the trivia rounds.  Still, we had great fun.  Its better if the teams are evenly matched, then its more fun.  The main objection I have is that in the 8 rounds, many of the movies are dated and overused.  There are great ones, though...Rain Man, Cast Away!!  Also, this game is linear in progression, there is no variation in the order of the questions.  Scoring uses the honour system.  There are 3 games, each lasting around 45 minutes at the very fastest, its the same as the cost of a regular DVD and is much more fun with lots of people.  I have bought this for several people and some of my friends have as well.  Recently I played a game where a 12 year old and an 82 year old were playing so don't worry about the age thing, both enjoyed it.  Really, I recommend it

I bought this for my son for Christmas, which at the time he was only 14 months old.  The age says from 18 months.  The problem is he can't hold the button down to make it go so I have to walk around the train and hold the button for him.  We had a playgroup over and there were kids that were over 2 years old and they couldn't hold the button down either.  Overall my son loves it but its not age appropriate for him.  

Also, this toy is cheaper at Toys-R-Us.  I got ours when it was on sale for $[...].  After Christmas they had them on sale half off for $[...]

This Angel is sure to be a gem in any collectors collection. She is elegant and graceful. Her gown in beautiful as well as her spiral curled hair. She is adorned in a golden head chain. She has a chain sash which is also part of her gown. At last she is given beautiful golden wings and holds a bouquet of flowers. This one will definately be worth the value in the years to come

As with all the leap frog products, this ones a lot of fun. Packed full of learning surprises. I have always felt that making learning fun and easy cuts down on the fact that it's 'work'. The Birthday Surprise is fun and full of rhyming words, that make little one want to learn. I have a hard time giving any leapfrog products anything but a 5 star rating, because of the quality in all their products.
Learning last a lifetime, so get them started with fun friends from Leap Frog.

This case is nice and tough, it holds all the accessories for the FP3 player securely.  I gave it 4 stars because I think things like FP3 players need a home and it serves that purpose great.  It matches with the player and is built to withstand kids.  I did take a star off my rating because, as it does have a smallish loop to hold it by, it should really have a handle.  Little hands need something easy to hold on to, and the little loop does not suffice for any purpose I could see

My three children are huge fans of Melissa and Doug puzzles and with as many as we own we sure needed a way to store them neatly.  Being an organization freak myself, I was in search of the perfect storage case.  Not only did it need to hold many puzzles, but it needed to be made well and look nice too.  Melissa and Doug to the rescue - once again!  We purchased the same storage case in natural and it's been a life saver in our toy room - it makes it easy for them to put the puzzles away without them losing pieces anymore.  You might find it hard to spend $30 on an empty storage case so I suggest looking for the storage case that comes with six puzzles for $60 instead.  More for your money!  In our case, we own so many puzzles that we didn't need anymore and especially duplicates of what we already have

I bought this bed for my two year old because he got too big for his crib.  He moves around A LOT in his sleep so I wanted a safe first bed for him.  He absolutely loves this bed and actually he is sleeping much better now than he was before.  The only problem was that the mattress and box spring we bought were too high, so we just use the mattress for now. Eventually we'll put the box spring back in.

1. Tape as many Jenga sticks together with masking tape on one side to support a favorite picture that you would like to turn into a special puzzle. 
2. Have your child find a any picture they would like to turn into a puzzle (even a favorite photo can work.)
3. Glue whole picture to opposite side of masked taped Jenga.
4. Shellac and allow to dry 
5. Use excto knife and cut the picture apart. 
6. Remove tape and voila`--your own hand-made puzzle! 
Even toddlers can put a 5 piece puzzle of an animal or fruit together and they love creating their own puzzle! Enjoy! Aloha

I purchased this toy for my 2 year old son. He absolutely loves it! He had played with it before because his older cousin has one. I had searched in stores around me wanting to buy it but no one had it. Sure enough I found it on Amazon. It's a lot of fun to play with and he just loves to rock out with it. I definately recommend this toy

I purchased this Train Case for my son last Christmas, (age 6).  It is very sturdy, with handle.  I like that all the trains can be put into one place and carried away simply/easily.  Those moms like myself, when your child has finished playing, there is now a place for them to put their trains in.  The 'metal' case is a great added bonus, the trains have the magnetic ends and they easily go into case.  Next play time, the trains are all in one spot. Thomas, come up with a place like this for the track - I need it

I bought the Harry Potter Magic Puzzles for my nieces and I scored some major brownie points.  They loved this at first because it was about their hero, Harry Potter, however, they play with it for hours on end.  Putting the puzzles together is fun in itself, but then there are the cool magic tricks and the VERY COOL optical illusion using the spiral disk too.  This is great for any kid interested in magic, as well jigsaw puzzles and Harry!  A big thumbs up

Our 3 children have had hours of fun with this toy during the 2+ years we've had it in our home.  True, the food is long gone (cardboard boxes - toddlers - no surprise there).  We've also needed lash the front piece on with some string (again, it's not constructed to be a bumper car but toddlers don't often keep their play inside the box).  The simple design means that when they twist it beyond reason, it's flexible enough for me to pop it back into alignment.  It's small enough to be comfortable for the 2 year old to push(for hours), and close enough to the real thing to remain interesting for a 5-6 year old.  It's gender neutral, forgiving enough to go down a flight of stairs (repeatedly) without breaking, light enough to not squish whatever's at the bottom.... and sometimes they do even use it to play grocery

I bought two of these trucks for my twin boys when they were 16 months old.  They loved it so much and the bubbles come out the front for added fun. The music and lots of buttons to push, a storage under the seat and a fire helmet makes this a fabulous toy. My boys are now 27 months and have not stopped playing with this truck!!  Its great, buy it, buy it!

My kids (4.5 and 1) love this car. The sounds it makes are great. They take turns riding on it and the other one pushing. It is quite durable and they play with it all the time. Only negative is that some of the stickers peeled off. Overall, it's a great toy and the kids play with it every day

He's into firetrucks and Mickey Mouse so you couldn't ask for a better toy.  It's small enough to ride around the house without running into everything, but also durable enough to play outside with. It's the first thing he goes for in the morning and the last thing he's playing with at night (most days)

This is the Optimus Prime that should have been made 20 years age. It was a difficult decision whether to open it or save it in the original packaging. Finally nostalgia won out and I had to transform him. It was amazing. The transformation took time but it was worth the wait. I felt like a kid again. I am totally satified with this product.

theres a few things the are nice about this prime and things that arent

pros:extrem detail coloring is good megatron rifle is sweet mouth moves

cons:primes regular gun will barley fit in primes hands bit more platic then die cast a pain to transform pushing legs in most of all sound base sounds like a ultra magnus mixed with prime

I can find more cons then pros I would ONLY get this toy for some one 11 or older not somebody who goes all wild and takes there toys every where oh wait another PRO!:primes leg vents open when you stand him u

I just transformed it for the first time into a truck. It was challenging but doable. Probably one of the coolest toys ever, but I was an 80's child. As someone else mentioned, the grill in front does not quite align with the cab windows when it's all set, but other than that it's great. Tremendous amount of detail (moveable leg vents, head, mouth, individual fingers/thumb poseable, light behind Matrix, datacom interface, working shocks on the wheels, and accessories). It's quite tall and heavy for a toy- very impressive. If a piece snaps off from forcing it the wrong way, it is designed to snap back on. I never got to own a Transformer as a teen but my lost childhood is now officially redeemed. This will adorn my office cube as a conversation piece

The instructions could of been better on the hooks and the net but you could figure it out. You had to take the target out that they gave you because if you hit it it would slow the ball down. Then you just put ribbon on the outline of the other target. Otherwise I it is holding up great  so far!

I purchased this as a birthday gift for my 11 year old grandson. I knew it would be a hit as my son had received it as a gift from his grandparents as a child and was entertained for hours with it. It did not lose it's charm for 11 year old boys through the years. My grandson was thrilled with it as well. Just enough challenge to keep their interest

Our three Asian-American granddaughters got these today for Christmas and they love them! Ignore the 5-star reviews that trash these cute little dolls, then try to steer you to eBay for another doll. These are the genuine article and kids LOVE them, as they have for generations. Our thirty-plus daughter-in-law still has her original Cabbage Patch doll, and she still loves it, just as her daughters loved theirs today

The game is fun....we played it when we lost electricity during Hurricane Isabel and was kept entertained! I dont know if I would take everything in the game as seriously as everyone else is, writing bad reviews. If you look to a board game for "truth" in life, youre not going to get far! This game is fun and makes you think and re-think what you THINK you know! I suggest it for teens

My daughter received this toy for her fourth birthday.  She plays with it all the time!!!  It didn't come with any tapes and honestly she doesn't need them!  She spends quite some time speaking into the microphone and using the slide to change the sound of her voice.  It is so funny!  We all get a kick out of it.  There are several different sounds to choose from.  Even her two year old twin sisters get into the act.  They love it.
Love this toy.  It's extremely durable.  Would absolutely recommend this

Yes, all the princess need a prince to fight over.  We had a blonde to do the honors but the girls are much happier having 2 competing males to do the honors.  His clothes are easy to get on and he is as dashing as they come.  Need to find one more less european prince to finish the collection

I bought this house for my daughter who will be 3 in 2 month's.  I did a lot of research and was torn between the twin town house and this one the Loving Family Sweet Sound's house. At first I almost went with the My first doll house by Fisher Price but was told by a friend she would proberly grow out of that fast and she was right.  This house the Sweet Sound's is a perfect size for her and I know she will get quite a few year's out of it.  Yes the Furniture is impossible to find.  After reading the review's I didn't look for it much knowing I would never find it.  I ended up buying her the Twin town's bathroom and a few pieces from the My first doll house by Fisher Price.  The pieces work perfect together and are chunkier for her and not so many tiny pieces.  They work great with the doll's that come with it too.  I did also purchase one doll set from twin town house.  The house does make some sound's with just the pieces that come with it, they are cute and my daughter doesn't know any better that it would make more if we could of found the correct sweet sounds furniture.  She's Happy with the way it is. I decided against the Twin Town because I agreed with some reviewers after looking at it that the room's were too tiny.  Yes you get more room's but my daughter I know would get so frusterated with alway's knocking the furniture over in those tiny room's.  This house has big room's.  It fold's up easy in half but not so good when it is filled with furniture.  We leave it open anyway's so that is not a big deal.  It was easy put together but the sticker's took about and hour to put on.  Also a note make sure and put the battery in BEFORE you fill it with furniture, I put the battery in last and ended up spilling the furniture everywhere.  
  Also I didn't see any one mention the front door.  I am not really sure why but it doesn't open from the outside, only from the inside.  You can open it from the outside but you have to pull it very hard and really aren't supose to open it that way.  Why not be able to open it both way's???  I guess their thinking is so if you are moving it so the door doesn't swing open but they could of put a little latch on it so you could of closed it shut when you wanted.   
  Also I am not sure what room is supose to be the bathroom.  I think it is either the bedroom or above that which I thought was the kid's playroom.  I ended up putting the bathroom in the right side of the bathroom.
All in all I think is is a great doll house and I would recommend it

This Emperor Penguin Puppet is a real hit with my 5 year old.  We almost never use it as a puppet but rather as a plush toy/pal.  This penguin looks round and pregnant, but to my kid, this penguin is a perfect friend.  He has pretty much outgrown all of his plush toys, but for some reason, this one has a place in his heart and in his imagination

I have an infant in-home daycare and needed a quad stoller for my four babies.  When I first found these connectors, no one could tell me if they would connect two tandem double strollers together.  I asked every store in town almost (some didn't even know what they were!). I just decided to buy them and hoped that they would work.  So I went out and bought two Kolcraft Lil' Limo strollers, not knowing, of course, if it would work or not.  I'm happy to say that they seem to work really well!  I did have to buy a second set, though, so I have five connectors on mine(couldn't find room for the sixth one).  Just lock the two inner front wheels so they can't turn and you're off!  It is a little hard to turn corners(just take them at a wide angle), but otherwise it works great!  I ended up spending just under [price] for the total cost of it, much less buying an actual quad stroller.  I hope this info will be helpful to someone else also. Good luck

I just got the whole set of geotrax and really think they look great and way cheaper than Thomas however the round housecan only hold one train at a time so it derails the train if you have more than one locomotive. they really need to add the reverse as well so they kids and me ( mom ) LOL can really make use of all the options. However, overall I really love this toy but yes I had to convert my office room into the Geotrax room. be ready to do this if not stick to the basic set up. Its very hard though since it all is so coo

I was very pleased when this toy finally arrived.  The Blue Devil is removable and semi-posable (his arms move).  He is the same size as the Simpson figures from the Playmates line of toys, so I feel like he was made with collectors of those figures in mind.  The Homer donut-eating action doesn't always work correctly--the mouth and donuts aren't correctly synchronized, so sometimes the donuts miss his mouth--but that does not detract from the fun

I played "Atmosfear, The Harbingers" on VHS in the mid-90s and several years later bought a copy of the game through ebay.  Then, I saw this DVD update and gave in to temptation when the price was marked down.  Here's my judgement: 1) The mechanics have been simplified.  This has it's pros and cons.  It could have been made easier to learn without removing as many components.  2) The gatekeeper has less of a nasty/funny balance in the DVD update.  3) It is a major upswing to have his dialogue randomly disbursed.

One reviewer seemed to think the game was boring.  I'll guess, instead, that the people he parties with don't have the attention span for board games.  Too bad for them.  Atmosfear - The DVD Board Game get's a B+ from me

      This is a well thought of game.  A game where the players play along with the DVD as the Gatemaster gives you commands, rewards, or punishiments while they are playing the game.  Players can also watch the rules and the setup instructions on the DVD.  Six keys of six different types will be laid out on some of the spaces, as your goal is to get one of each type and rush to the center before 49 minutes is up.  If neither player wins in 49 minutes, the Gate master has defeated you.  In the beginning you write down your fears and reveal them at the end which is always fun.  The board has six territories.  Each character owns a territory which has a set of the same keys.  You can pick up a key by landing on the key space, having a card telling you to, gate master telling you to, or winning a duel.  A duel is when you land on a battle space and 2 players wager a key for a dice roll to see who gets both.  There are two types of cards... TIME and FATE.  Land on a skull head and get a FATE card which allows you to do something in a certain situation.  A TIME card you get if you land on a clock.  A time card allows you to do something if you play it in the exact second it tells you to. Sometimes the Gate master will give you the power to banish someone.  When there is reward, there is also punisment.  If you land on the cursed key, you have to pick it up and whenever you have it, you cannot win.  If you are landed into a black hole, you cannot participate until you are freed.  Also, you can lose keys.  During the game the Gate master says "Stop!" frequently and the players will have to lisen to what he says or be punished.  All in all, it is one of the best games out there and well worth the money.

The 1st version of this game was a fun and exiting game for my family. but we soon got bored of the same video over and over. We could not believe it when we saw a new version of the game out, we rushed out to buy it and found this version not the same and not as complicated or as fun as the first they should have just released the first version of the game with new dvd setup it was a waste of money

This toy is wonderful for several reasons. For one thing, it's really the only shape sorter your child will ever need. It has very basic shape sorting (with cut out holes in the sides and one door that can be opened for any shape block to go in), plus pretty complex shape sorting when you open various locks. 

The toy also helps teach colors and animals, and the locks develop fine motor skills even further.

Overall, this toy is very well made. It's real wood, dove tailed together. It could, of course, fall over, but if your child is the 18 months or older that is recommended for this toy, he or she probably isn't small enough for it to hurt. The locks on this toy are a little more chintzy. They wobble, which makes locking or unlocking some of them more difficult...But you could look at this as just another learning tool.

My biggest concern is that the blocks are relatively small; they could squeeze through a toilet paper tube. This means they are a potential choking hazard, so you'll want to supervise when your child uses this toy.

All that said, my 20 month old LOVES this toy and plays with it more than anything else she has

As a mother of 5, this toy has proven to be one of my favorites of all time.  My son received it for Christmas (at age 2 months) and it has been wonderful.  We place it in his bed at naps and at night, and he goes to sleep watching and listening to it.  When he wakes up, it is there for him to play with.  As he has grown (he is now 7 months), he has become increasingly more interested in the sounds and textures of the toy, and now puts the corners in his mouth which has helped with teething.  I have been impressed with the sound quality (it is not annoying like most musical children's toys) and I will be anxious to see if it causes my son to love music on a different level.  LOVE THIS TOY!

I bought this for my 6 month old granddaughter and she loves it! The music quality is great and she really enjoys the lights. It has a very sweet face and she smiles and talks to it a lot. I got it on clearance which is good because as cute as it is, I don't think it is worth the original price. I would definately recommend it if you can get it on sale

This doll is cute and fun to play with. My daughter loves it. I like these dolls better then bratz. They need to make more dolls that are dressed the way kids are. I think that Lil does. Im happy and my daughter has a toy I think will be around for a long time.

It is a very nice product. I bought if for my 1 year old grandbaby to take to nursery with him. I put in pictures of the family so he could look at them with his teachers. My daughter says it very useful, and he is adapting to his nursery quicker.

This is a super fun toy that my daughter has had now for over a year. If you can find it ANYWHERE I would highly recommend it. It plays pre-programmed songs plus your child can also be her own musician and even record her music for playback. The microphone is nice for aspiring American Idols (like my daughter!) and it really is pretty. We did lose the dancing Cinderella with Prince Charming, but while we had it is was beautiful to watch them dance while the piano played. It also does a pretty light show. I cannot give this toy enough stars as it is a really wonderful toy for 3-6 year old girls

I got this yesterday for my daughters (3 & 6 years old), and they like it very much...let's see how long that lasts.
The space is kind of cramped, but both of them fit in there with a few dolls, so I wouldn't complain about that.  Setting it up was pretty easy, and although it has almost no stability (it gets toppled every couple of minutes or so), that doesn't seem to take away the fun from it.
However, there were a couple of surprises for me:

a)  The product I got is very different from the picture in the advertisement.  It is still shaped like a castle and has the Disney Princesses and all, but it is just different.  I am not complaining, my girls like it a lot.
b)  As I said before, setting it up was fairly easy (just keep your face away as you take it out of the box, for it will spring out on you VERY FAST), but, trying to disassemble it and putting it away is a completely different story.  For that, you have to remove 4 rods (which were not so easy to insert in the first place), and then, you have to fold the thing away twisting it in a way that only experienced snake handlers would be expected of being able to do so (I don't care how easy it should be according to the instructions).  I tried it for about 20 minutes until I gave up.  And, if you don't keep the box this thing came in, just forget about storing it folded, it would be like trying to keep a "Jack in the Box" compressed without the "Box".  Think about it.

So, if you don't mind adding this to the permanent decor of your house, go for it, your girls will probably like it.

My 2 year old daughter recently recieved this as a present from her grandparents. She loves the disney princesses and was ver excited. I was happy to see how easy it was to put up and take down, she plays with it in her room almost everyday and I love the fact that we can take it down before she goes to sleep. Overall we are very pleased with this tent, although it would be nice if it was a bit bigger so that I could play in there with her

I was disappointed when I opened the box and set up the tent because it was much smaller than I expected it to be. My friend's daughter has an almost identical tent which is much bigger. Apparently there are two different kinds, one made by Playhut and one made by The Disney Store

We received Boggle Jr as a gift at Christmas. My daughter is almost four and absolutely loves this game. She is learning her words and is learning to spell. This is a wonderful game for learning picture recognition and verbalization and moving on to spelling three and four letter words. I told my sister and she requested it for her son. He's a happy camper with the game, too

The Suduko Board Game is the perfect gift for the older kids on your lists.  It is well made and can be played by one or two so they can use it alone or with friends.  Since it is wood it will last a long time whether it is being played by middle schoolers or college kids. Also, I paid $17.99 for this and have not found it anywhere near this price.  It is usually $29.99 to $39.99 for the exact same game

This doll is so beautful. Back off everybody, I am the bratz number 1 fan with over 120 of them! Seriously, and thats not all, I go on the website 4 hours a day, and am collecting bratz babyz and have many bratz furniture. Consider me the bratz expert. 
OK so hi everybody! I'm here to give you some tips 'n' tricks as well as handy hints on this particular talking bratz doll, who is my fave character YASMIN!
This doll, for starters, is a mixture of diferent bratz collections.  She has a bratz princess T-Shirt, wildwest cowboy a-go-go boots, forever diamonds fur, Bratz Fabulous coat and Passion For Fashion miniskirt. I mean Whoa! If you wanted to buy any of those dolls listed above, just get this! She is a mixture of all!
Secondly, she talks! Which is great. She is also interactive, saying over 125 phrases. If you place her with other talking bratz dolls, she will get excited and start to have a conversation! She can also talk to you if you are lonely. She has a sensor so she 'knows' what yor saying and can give a correct answer!
Also, she'll be your best friend at nightime. her lips light up while she speaks! The base at the bottom can be removed so she can be like a regular bratz doll! If you, however, press the button on the base, her lips wll still light up as she speaks.
And at only $19.99 , parents, all of you parents out there, you don't know what your missing

We bought my son a couple of starfighters, the tri-fighter, the AT-RT, and the wheel bike.  He loves the starfighters and likes the AT-RT a little.  He rarely plays with the wheel bike.  I think the starfighters are just simpler, sturdier, and easier to play with.  The wheel bike (and to a smaller extent the AT-RT) are more complicated, and thus less fun for a 5-year old.

We run around having mock dog-fights with the starfighters, but poor old General Grievous sits in the toy box.

Overall, probably good for older kids who can more expertly manipulate the legs and other stuff, but not all that fun for the younger guys

These blocks are so great! They've gone through their different stages of growth. They learned to reach for them, peek inside, grasp them, toss them around and now stacking them to make towers. My triplets are 20 mos and have had them for about a year. Love them all

All of the peek a blocks are fun. Although each set has a different 'theme' they are very similar and enjoyable to play with. 

These blocks are great fun. Each block has something interesting inside it. In our house these have been played with by boys and pretty roughly at times. The windows to see inside are still clear and not one of these blocks have broken. So I would say they are sturdy and hold up well to normal play. 

On the ends of each block is a texture. Within each block is something interesting. And many blocks have an activity associated with it- push a button to make a noise, twist a knob to make something turn around etc. 

The one thing I would warn is that these blocks do not stack well, particularly in tall towers. So if you are thinking of buying these for tower building, I'd consider a different set of blocks. Otherwise, these are excellent toys. 

They provide a basis for communication and vocubulary building with your child. They are sturdy and encourage language, eye hand coordination and so on. 

If you enjoy toys that are fairly quiet, do more than have a push button to make a noise, foster independent creative play and exploration of the world this is an excellent toy. 

Enjoy.

My daughter has trouble concentrating in school. I got this for her birthday and her grades instantly improved to the point where her teacher stated that there was a noticable improvement in all areas of her work. The best thing about it is that I don't have to tell her to use it because she loves it. I told her it's just like having a laptop because she always wanted a computer of her own. This is as close as I'm willing to get concenrning her having her own computer at her age, plus it's a minute fraction of the price of a personal laptop.

For children who don't have a hard time in school, this may not be for them but for my daughter it is a whole lot of what I needed to help me help her learn. I just wish I could find an adapter.

MY TWO YEAR OLD SON GOT THIS POOH BEAR FOR A &quot;BIRTH&quot; GIFT.  HE BRINGS HIM EVERYWHERE.  IT'S GREAT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T TAKE UP MUCH ROOM.  HE HAS TWO NOW, BUT LET ME TELL YOU HE CAN TELL THEM APART!!!  THE TAG ON HIS &quot;FIRST&quot; ONE IS SLIGHTLY MORE WORN AFTER COUNTLESS WASHINGS AND HE LIKES THAT ONE BEST.  THE &quot;OTHER ONE POOH BEAR&quot; AS HE CALLS IT, WORKS ONLY IN EMERGENCIES.  MY 9 MO. OLD DAUGHTER IS GETTING THE PIGLET SINCE SHE LOVES THE POOH TOO BUT THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF MY SON GIVING ONE UP.  BUY THIS TOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

In Boggle, players compete against one another and a 3-minute hourglass to find word combinations across randomly distibuted letter cubes on a 4x4 grid.

The game develops pattern recognition skills, and because most possible words are only three or four letters long, astute younger players can play adults without too much of s handicap.

Tactics learned playing Boggle translate well into success at Scrabble and other word games, while the clock management skills help with chess and test taking.

Boggle is lightweight and makes a good travel game, though you might want to bring a zipper-lock sandwich bag to avoid losing the letter cubes. As an added plus, the game can be played solitaire with minimal dropoff in entertainment value.

If you enjoy Boggle, you might want to seek out Big Boggle, which uses a 5-by-5 grid (56% more cubes). Words and time limit are both longer.

I received this Ty pig as a baby shower gift. My son "discovered" it when he was 18 months old and it's his dearest companion besides his "night-night." Piggy must go for car rides, eat with him, get jammies on and go to the Dr. to have his temperature checked. We love Piggy because when he's covered with milky Cheerios, we can just throw him in the washer and dryer. He's good as new in about an hour. Who wouldn't love that? It's also a great toy for allergy sufferers because it can be thoroughly cleaned regularly to remove dust mites. We love it and my son loves it. Now we ordered a spare Piggy so that there is a Piggy substitute when Piggy is bathing. Enjoy your toddler

I just bought this doll @ Toys R Us and I was also able to purchase The Hilary Duff Shopping Sisters doll which is supposed to include her sister Haylie Duff which isn't available yet. I have the two other Hilary dolls the first of which was released in 2002 or 2003 and it was a Lizzie McGuire doll which doesn't look much like Hilary at all. Then there was the Hilary dolls released by Playmates which had a more slight resemblance than the first doll. Now Mattel has made a doll of Hilary Duff and it is by far the most visibly accurate doll I've seen. And the clothes and accessories are really cute too. I think a lot of girls would love this doll and possibly older fans too. I'm just waiting for the Haylie Duff doll to debut early next year and her doll also bears a striking resemblance. The dolls are available @ Toys R Us, KB Toys, Wal-Mart all under $20.00.

I think this a great item for a child over 3 1/2.  Since there are 4 puzzles in one box, our son, who just turned 3 has a hard time keeping the pieces separate.  They are symbol coded on the back, so I think once he gets older it will get easier.  He loves the pictures and I love that the pieces are sturdy and how much he is learning.
Highly recommnde

this pony has proved (along with the Princess Promenade) to be one of the most popular of the my little pony's we have bought. It comes with a pink skirt, a pink crown and high heel shoes. The most popular item was the dressing table with revolving mirror and after several months it still hasn't broken despite harsh treatemnt. The pony is white with silver strands through the mane and tail. It was very pretty but the rough treatment really does make the mane matted very quickly. Also, think about getting white pony's very seriously for younger children, While the coloured ones can be drawn on with pen and the stains wiped off and at least partly concealed - on white ponys it is impossible to hide. For the younger ones (3 year olds) it is hard to get them not to at first. Desert Rose was very pretty but is now a bit stained and sorry looking. Never the less she is integral in my children's games still which is nice. One of the more popular ponies we have bought. Generally very hard wearing, including the accessories, the only item which has been broken is the crown which didn't last - it was too thin and got badly bent early on

I MADE SURE TO CLEAR DEBRIS BEFOREHAND AND IT SEEMS SOMETHING VERY SMALL WOUNDED THIS TOY. I'VE REFILLED IT BUT I'M A LITTLE APPREHENSIVE ON WHERE TO LET MY KIDS USE THIS. IT SEEMS THAT IT TAKES VERY LITTLE TO DISABLE THIS TOY.

My son received this toy for his first birthday!  I will be purchasing it as gifts for all my friends!!  He LOVES pushing the button and listening the the music.  I was wondering if he would be able to figure out the gears, but he has caught on very quickly and loves to take the gears off and put them back on.  He also enjoys stacking the gears up and watching them go around!  I like that it has a handle so he can carry it around with him.  It keeps him involved for up to 20 minutes at a time!  
It is very durable as he carries it around, has chewed on the gears (which are made of strong plastic and cannot be marred by chewing on them).

My three year old also likes to play with it!  Her play is a little sofisticated with it as she tries to figure out which gears have to be put where (as in, do they have to be next to the middle spinning one) placed to make them spin and how many can be stacked and they still turn.

My one wish is that Playskool would include a few extra gears.  We have them everyhwere in our house and cannot always find them all.  It would be great if they had a place where you could purchase extra ones for replacements and/or to have extras for stacking.

This is an awesome toy that the kids love, can learn from, and is very durable!  It is a must have!

We've had one in the house for a few years now. The kids (5 and 2-1/2) love it. It's soft, cuddly, and sized just right for them. It's been taken all over the place, has provided companionship for them on many a long trip (including two to South Korea), given comfort when they are sad, and been used for countless hours of make-believe. Its worth has been far more than what was paid for it

When I ironed my 14M son wanted to play with it. He helps with the house cleaning.  I bought this toy iron that really has an on and off switch, sprays water and pretend buttons.  He loves it and pushes it around the carpet like he is ironing the carpet.  We "play" iron with the water when I have time. This is one toy that I can take anywhere and he stays busy for quite some time.

This is one of the few toys, it seems, which has remained fundamentally unchanged since we were children.  The push-stick is shaped a little differently (I remember a thin blue broom stick with an orange or red handle) but otherwise, it is the same.  No electronic sounds or flashing lights have been added - although you can get it that way, too, if you want.  Personally I think these things detract from the imagination building aspects of certain toys.  I'm not saying we have no talking or musical or flashing toys, but it dismays me when these things are added to the classics (think Little People farm etc).

What I love about this toy is it can be ANYTHING.  It's a sweeper!  It's a carpet cleaner!  It's a mop!  It never fails to crack me up when my son comes running after me with his corn popper when I am cleaning.  It's a lawnmower!  So many jobs around the house or yard can be copied with the corn popper.  And if mom or dad isn't up to much, it's still great fun to run around with which means exercise for the kiddies.  It's a solo toy and a playing-with-other-kids toy.  Any time we have other children over to play, the corn popper comes out as they chase each other about the house.

We got this toy when my son was 13 months.  He is now 3y4m and still playing with this toy.  I have seen 5 and 6 year olds still playing with the corn popper.  There are few toys that are so simple and yet offer so much fun.  Sturdy, too - very important as it's bound to be crashed into a few walls.  I can't think of another toy which will give you more bang for your buck - unless you count dirt and measuring spoons and all those other free things that kids so exasperatingly pick over the toys you paid good money for.  

I am a little alarmed at the current PRICE listed for this toy, though.  You should not need to pay that much for it.  Occasionally this item becomes hard to find - especially at Christmas - but usually there are tons of them in the stores for around the cost of a President Hamilton.  Right now this is listed for twice that.

Bought this game at Books a Million in North Carolina for a mere $10+tax. A very good deal! Although I don't keep up on a lot of contemporary literature, I was able to do pretty well. Within three hours I had all but one pie. One of the teammates did as well. The third of us wasn't as lucky, but it was a fun game nonetheless. As with all board games, the fun is in the company, not knowing all the answers. The questions were good, and yes - tough - but they were tough for all of us, not slanted towards one particular audience. 

I would have given this 5 stars except that there really do need to be more question cards. But for $10, three adults had three hours of intelligent entertainment (we went through half of the cards). We got our money's worth

We live in Alaska and really wanted two of these games to pass on to our married daughters since it has been a holiday tradition to play.  We found them for purchase on Amazon but were displeased at the cost to ship to Alaska.  Although we are part of the US and USPS ships for a reasonable price, we weren't given that option and paid at least double what it could have been.  UPS and FedEx rip off those of us in Alaska while USPS treats us just like everybody in the Lower-48.  Give us a USPS option

We purchased the item hoping that it would be of reasonable size, meaning the food would be closer to "real" size rather than miniature. It was. We also hoped it would be made well and stand up to hopefully more than one generation of use. That remains to be seen, but the stuff is made well and I cannot see it breaking unless you deep-freeze the plastic pieces and hit them with a hammer. Nice texture, nice flexibility, pretty realistic looks. The child it was intended for (age 4 and a bit) plays happily with it, even the older boys (10 and 13) have had a few moments of goofy fun with it

I have two boys, 10 and 12.  The younger one bought a webkinz first and after seeing how much fun he had at the website, the older one asked for one for his birthday.  The website is very kid friendly.  You won't have to worry about what they will see on this website.  It is great fun, and even I play on it!  I highly recommend this for any age child

I purchased this expansion set, along with the Thomas and Friends Water Towr Figure 8 Set, for my 2 year old this past Christmas. The expansion set was an afterthought, prompted in no small part by the manufacturer's promotion running at the time (50% off this set with the purchase of a Figure 8 set).

With the conclusion of many initial hours of intense playtesting (an ongoing process, with no termination in sight), my son agrees that this is an essential choice for any but the most basic (read: boring) wooden railroad layout. This expansion pack comes with switch tracks, and allows little train engineers (and their dads) to reverse directions or explore different parts of the railway. In retrospect, I think that I would have been dissatisfied had I not purchased this set to complement the basic Figure 8 layout, promotional price or not.

As far as the quality, the Learning Curve wooden track is made from hardwood, and is more substantial than many other brands of compatible track (i.e. Maxim, First Learning, etc.). This is a consideration when your child insists on taking the track apart by him/herself to put away. We have already broken a couple of pieces of generic track this way, since the male end of the connectors is a bit weaker than the rest of the track.

Overall, we are quite satisfied with this set, and look forward to many more hours of enjoyment

But I like Sasha and Jade better. She's cute though. She has brown hair with blond highlights and big hazel eyes and her beauty mark looks so cute!

Her first outfit is a pink tank top with a silver necklace design. Her skirt is a strange black, pink, and gold pattern. Her shoes are pink with small gold hearts and a yellow "stone" in the middle.

Her second outfit is a black tank top with a silver chandelier design. Her jeans are light blue with flower designs and a silver and hot pink fringe over it. Her shoes are black mary janes with red designs on them.

Thanks for reading my review! Hope you enjoy her

We bought this set for my seven year old boy and we were a bit dissapointed. There are better magic kits out there for the price for older children. (Look at the Marshal Broden Kits by Cadaco). If you have a young child is is four and five though this is a great set. The tricks are easy to work and they are big for small hands. Anyone who has any magic sets or tricks though will find this too simplistic and not as exciting as many of the other kits.

My 3 year old opened this for Christmas and loved it.  Who would have guessed that this little car would have been a bigger hit than a lot of the more expensive things he was given!  It doesn't get stuck on any surface that we've tried it on and drives right over things in its path, which my son thinks is REALLY COOL!  Great toy for a relatively inexpensive price

No bells, no whistles -- Just an action figure with its' own four-wheeler.  It can capture the mind of a car-obsessed 6 year old boy for an hour at a time at least :-)  Some of the objects that the action figure is supposed to hold don't stay in his hand very well, but oh well -- it seems that all my nephew wanted to do was crach the thing anyway!  And it takes that quite well.

It does work well for teaching and using it as a toy that we can play together.

More track is the first thing you're going to want to buy after your first GeoTrax train set.  It will seem like you never have enough straights and curves to bring the track design to reality.  The "switched" pieces work out better as the child gets older (3-4+)

Easy to follow instructions for set-up and play, very intuitive.  The only thing I would suggest is to make sure the young folks have an 'elder' playing on their team, to have a shot at the questions on old people, events, etc.  If they're real sports history buffs, then it's not an issue

My son calls this a flute, and rather than argue, we let it go. But his little hands have a hard time holding it. (He's 4). Even I have trouble. I'm right-handed and the right-hand keys are on the bottom. I don't know if that's how real clarinets are, but it's awkward. Also, your whole mouth has to be covering the entire mouthpiece in order to make it play, so that's also a little frustrating. But the sound is great and it's fun to play once you get the hang of it

Nursing Nana is a great gift. It is soft and cuddly, and the puppies attach with magnets, giving a realistic nursing "tug" as you attach and detach them. This would be a great gift for a child when a second or third child is being born to take the angst out of mom nursing the new baby. It is a bit smaller than I anticipated, but it is still worth it because it is well-made

This is a beuatiful dining set.  True, it doesn't come with the pony as it clearly states in the product description, but we have too many already.  Anyway, I would recommend it for the crystal princess castle or you can even use this with other doll houses

This concept is very interesting and new fangled (at least to me) as far as plush animals.  The interactive/internet/game aspect is very clever and provides a lot of fun for kiddos.  I got this for my nephew and he likes it.  It keeps him entertained.  One thing--they just don't make stuffed animals the way they used to as far as quality.  Justin is not rough with his toys, and this hippo has already lost some of his hair.  I wish we could find good quality plush anymore.  I hate the idea of disposable toys because I grew up with tonka toys and teddybears that I still have.  I still have my Raggedy Ann and Andy dolls from about twenty-five years ago, and they have never lost hair.  So buy the hippo for fun, but don't expect him to survive

 A retooled mold brings this 60s sci-fi kit back to the hands of today's kit builders!

 Not QUITE accurate to the sets & miniatures of the original show... the passenger compartment should have 2 more seats, the control yokes are not included with the pilot's console, plus the top dome is round instead of teardrop-shaped... but these are all true to the original Aurora model.

 Wouldn't take much to fix the mistakes, as there are plenty of references & replacement decal sheets out there... or just build it "as is" for nostalgia value

I started playing this game in it's original German version. Which, went through some revision as the expansion decks were put out. As a result, the english version may end up being a little more together as you get the expansion decks. Talk about a wonderful game to play for two people! It is absolutely well put together, though certainly different in playing than the boardgame version of Catan. It uses the same notions, but has a far more dynamic involvement within the game play itself. The expansion packs are absolutely great, and overall add lots of options and twists to the play of the game. IT takes a couple of hours, and a signicant amount of table space. It travels well enough in it's box, but to actually play it you need time and lots of space. 
I highly recommend it, especially if you are only two people and looking for a game that you can play that is fun, involving, and certainly full of strategy. This is one of the many wonderful games made by Klaus Teuber, and I hope he keeps coming up with winners

This is a great game for two players (and two players only).  The first one or two times I played, it was very, very slowgoing because there is a lot to take in.  However, once you adapt to the numerous cards and they become familiar to you, games tend to take about an hour.  It's a fairly involved game, so you have to be in the mood for that.  There's a lot of strategy and many ways to win.  I greatly recommend it for those who already enjoy playing games.  It might be daunting for a really casual gamer, though.  If you like it, there are now expansion sets available that add lots of spice and variety to the original

I stumbled upon this game years ago, and my family has enjoyed it--even my adult friends, who seemed to balk at first at playing a kids' game.  This past year, I decided to purchase it for my sixth grade classroom.  I must say...WOW.  I allowed the kids to play it for a while during homeroom, and kids would be waiting early outside the room to get in and snag the Frog Juice.  They would even play it over other outdoor games at recess.  Anytime you heard a "NOOOO!" in the room, you knew someone had pulled out the Witch Wash.  The kids LOVED it.

So, I have come back to purchase a new deck for this upcoming year.  To any educators who might be reading this, it makes a great addition to the intermediate classroom for those few minutes of downtime, and because of the math and bit of strategy involved, you don't feel guilty about it at all.  Plus, it is something different and for the teacher, inexpensive as far as games go

This was my first Schleich World of Knights figure, given to me Christmas of this year. It's a highly detailed classic dragon, with no moving or detachable parts (the wings are an integral part of the figure). As such, it's safe for very young children, and you don't have to worry about someone's eye getting put out. As to its historical accuracy and educational value, I really cannot say, never having seen Dragons in the wild, but the level of detail is wonderful, and it should encourage children to obtain the more "practical" members of the balance of Scheich World of Knights collection, which are excellent, as well

I recently purchased this game using a gift certificate.  My little boy LOVES it. I think it's quite interesting as well but there were several typos on the game cards.  Frankly, there needs to be better proof reading.  Was this game assembled and printed in another country other than the USA.  That would probably account for it

It takes a few hands to learn all the tricks to this game, but once learned, it is a lot of fun. A good game for four players, and a great game for six players.  It generates lots of lively action, with the bidding for the cards.

We played this game on a cruise with four strangers. They were no longer strangers, after the game.  Everyone we have played with say they are going to buy it.  That's how we got it.  Bought the game after playing with family.

This figure is one of the best in the marvel legends series. I have over forty of the marvel legends figures and this is the tallest. The hair on his body looks real and his joints aren't to tight, but not to lose either their just right. I couldn't wait for them to release more Exiles members like Noctourne, Blink, Morph, & Mimic. I wasn't very happy to see the marvel legends series coming to an end with the seperation of marvel from Toy Biz the last series are going to be realeased later this year. I'm glad to see Psylocke & Falcon before the series end, but what about the wildly popular She Hulk. They've got the loser Sabertooth from the Exiles coming out, but not She Hulk. If you're going to bring an Exiles to the series at least bring characters we like. NOCTOURNE, MORPH, BLINK, MIMIC!!!!

We purchased this game for our son for Christmas.  He is a chess lover, and we wanted to get him something a little different.  Chaturanga was perfect, since it is the precursor to chess.  He has enjoyed the game.  All of us were impressed with the bookshelf edition.  It is an attractive box.   We are very pleased with every aspect of it

Chaturanga is the oldest known form of chess.  It dates back to India in the seventh century A.D.  Front Porch classics has carefully re-created this game and it is now available to everyone!

The game itself is beautiful.  It is played on a fabric playing board (all games were once played on fabric, it's extremely portable and cheap, and cardboard wasn't even invented until the late 1800's!).  Unlike chess, the game can be played with two to four players.  Each player gets 8 playing pieces, made of clay: A Raja, an elephant, a horse (cavalry), a ship and four infantrymen.  These pieces are kept in beautiful velvet bags.  Each piece does have a loose equivalent in modern chess.  

The Raja is the most important piece, much like the king.  The elephant acts much like the rook.  The ship is the bishop, and you cannot capture a Raja with the ship.  The Cavalry moves exactly like a knight.  The infantry, which in this game look kind of like tiny Buddhas in lotus position, are like the pawns.  The big difference between Chaturanga and chess is that Chaturanga is played with a four-sided die (it's a long rectangle, instead of a perfectly square cube).  The die tells you which piece you have to move.

The game is somewhat easier to learn than chess, but easily as much fun.  The game can and should be used by teachers and parents to introduce their children to the history and culture of India.  The rulebook includes lots of interesting information about India as well as about the history of the game.  

The game comes in a convenient Bookshelf Edition, where the game is kept in a beautiful book-shaped box that looks great on any bookshelf or coffee table

We bought this for our daughter's first birthday. She was immediately interested and so was her three-year-old brother. In addition, her five cousins (ages 5-16) and their father (36)were also captivated. There are eleven gears in five colors that spin when the button is pushed. Initially, she loved to take the gears off and teeth on them. She is fourteen months now and puts them back on. She presses the button to watch them spin. She has taken it to the sitter's and the kids there have played with it all day. When we take it to the sitter's, I put it in a bag because the gears do not stay on when the toy is vertical. So far,it appears to be a toy that will grow with her as she and her brother play with it differently. We rotate toys, but I leave this one out continuously and I often find her playing with it quietly by herself. I have given it five stars because it offers a variety of ways to play (the gears can even be stacked), is different from all other toys they have, appeals to a wide range of ages, grows with the child, does not use up batteries (we are still on the first set), and seems very durable. I recommend this toy

This game is a great way to pass twenty to thirty minutes.  It is very easy to learn and does not have any pieces to lose, or money to count.  The strategies, however, are numerous, and there is an equal amount of luck as skill involved in good gameplay.

I really liked how the game could ONLY be played with two people, as I was tired of games that COULD be played with two, but which were really meant to be enjoyed by three or more...

Game Contents: 1 deck of game cards, and one small board.  Note: If you want to make this game really portable you don't even need to bring the board.  It is just a place to put discarded cards and a way to help organize your cards.  As long as you have a pencil and paper for scoring at the end of the game, you can play it everywhere that you have a table.  (I figure you need as much space to lay down your cards as the size of a typical Monopoly board).

Playing Note: One thing that was initially a little confusing to us when we were reading the instructions, was that the instructions do not explain that you are to place your cards on the opposite side of the board as your opponent.  You can each play all 5 expeditions, in a head to head manner.  We were sitting on a couch at a coffee table, and we had turned the board horizontally to face us (instead of vertically) and the instructions were confusing until we moved the board 90 degrees.  The game designers assumed that you would play the game as one would play a game of checkers, sitting across from one another, but you don't actually have to play this way, even though you DO need to turn your board for the same effect.

This game is really fun and I would highly recommend other games from the same manufacturer (Rio Grande Games).  They really have a knack for publishing great strategy games.  They even release expansion sets to their popular games, and they credit the players who gave them the ideas for the expansion cards.  Pretty neat

This is the first game I've tried by the venerable Reiner Knizia.  I was really taken in by the combination of simple rules, but interesting strategy.  Since then, I've purchased several of his games.  For those who like Lost Cities, but also have a soft spot for Poker, try Battleline.  Samurai is a great introduction to the sometimes complicated world of "tile games", with Tigres and Euphrates being the much more complicated cousin (although again, the rules aren't that complicated...the difficulty comes via strategic decision making.)

So far, my all time favorite Knizia game...and frankly, one of my favorite games period, is Modern Art.  The game mechanics are fairly simple, easily explained in 5 minutes, with some of the more complex bidding rules explained in a trial game.  Essentially, it's a game about playing an auction...who is the best at playing the market, guessing at art values, and spending money wisely.  It's also a true crossover game... non-gamers, or those only exposed to the standard Monopoly, Trivial Pursuit, etc, will quickly learn how much fun it can be... and will probably be asking to play again

Lost Cities is a really fun game, and very addictive.  I've personally played over 200 matches already on the free online version available at http://www.flexgames.com/  Check it out and play against some really good players across the globe and get a feel for the game itself before buying.  I've had my name in the notification list for this game on amazon.com for some time now, so I'll definitely be purchasing it right away

Hello,
     My name is Cloe. Yes, because I love Bratz so much I changed my name from Matisyahu to Cloe. I love this doll. IT BEATS BARBIE AND KEN BY A MILE. Speaking of Barbie I also reccommend the singer AQUA she sings " I'm a Barbie Girl." Buy Cloe and the others while you can!!! It's worth it and it will be a decision you will NEVER in your whole entire life, however long that may be, regret

My two year old boy absolutely loves these puzzles. They're soft but sturdy and are more challenging than peg puzzles. It's a great puzzle for kids that can do more than peg puzzles but aren't ready for the regular 10 piece interlocking puzzles. There's a base template for each puzzle to help put it together or you can remove it for a bigger challenge. The only downside are some of the very small pieces...definitely need parental supervision for kids under 3

Well, this is the expansion for Settlers of Catan, and a lot of things have changed. The ability to build military forces adds depth to the game, as does the city improvements. The abundance of new cards is worth it if for the beautiful illustrations alone. The expansion makes the game a little bit longer to play, but it still should finish out well inside two and a half hours. My only complaint is that in several games, the Barbarians have not beaten us once, they are way too easy. However, this is minor and can be remedied with a house rule of your own. All in all, this makes a great game TOTALLY AWESOME

Maybe it's my computer or browser, but the picture here doesn't do this doll justice.  I bought one at my local drug store before I saw it here at Amazon.  I can tell you that this Beach Glam Barbie is gorgeous!  The picture here looks faded to me, but I have the doll right here in front of me, and the pink accessories are a lovely perfect shade of vivid pink, not pale or washed out as it appears to be in this photo.

This is a great Barney musical songbook, and can also be used as a play piano.  It's great that it has an auto turn off, after non-use.  However, if it is turned off, and something touches it, it automatically turns on by itself.  Many times, after the kids went to bed, and we happen to put something on top of the Barney Sing 'n Play Songbook, it turns on by itself.  Because the Songbook does not have a physical turn off switch, and something touches it, Barney will start talking in the silent room when the kids are asleep.  Just wish it has an on/off switch, so it will not be turned on accidentally.  Otherwise, my 3 year old loves it

My son got this toy for his birthday about a year ago, when he was two. It was one of the gifts we let him pick out on his own. He loved it and played with nothing else for a week! The songs are cute and familiar to him, plus Barney talks and sings to the music. The only draw backs were that I couldn't find an off button and that it is $20+ at local retailers. I wish the toys companies would cut us parents a little slack. LOL

I don't agree with the other review this doll is great to play with. She has such a pretty dress and vail. Her hair is very long and it get tangled pretty easy but if your good with barbie hair its not a problem. I would suggest that you buy the groom at the same time take it from me I still really want him. The barbie with blond hair is also very pretty

We have had this sandbox for five years.  It has been durable and my two kids ages 3 and 5 just love it.  Color of the plastic is still bright and has been under sun for years.  Sometimes water seeps in when it rains but this makes sand play even funner for kids.  We tend to put a rock on top of lid to keep it in place though it does cover the box perfectly.  It is also nice that the lid is attached to the box itself and is easy for kids to remove and put back on when done.  The kids usually sit outside of it though it can accomodate 1-2 small kids inside it as well.  I find most kids dont want to get sand all over and end up sitting outside of it regardless. Overall good investment and the kids love it

I noticed that this ladybug sand box only had 3&amp;1/2 stars and the others all had 5. I felt a need to speak up.  We bought this sandbox for our first son when he was three.  We lived in an apartment with a small back patio.  It was perfect, not too big but still room for a toddler or two to sit in it and play.  He played for hours!!  Now 5 years later, his little brother loves it and my first son, almost 9, still plays with the little one in it.  It still looks brand new, nestled under the tree in our big back yard.  It's really great just smaller than the others. We have since given this for every two year old birthday present we've bought! I highly recommend it

I give this toy low marks for educational value for two reasons: first, humans were not contemporary to the brontosaurus, and second, the egg is too big to have been laid by the adult dinosaur included in the set.  My mother sent this toy as a gift for my son's first birthday.  The package suggests this toy for ages 2-5, and in typical fashion, my son found the box to be just as interesting as the toy itself, but my three-year-old daughter was immediately and completely enchanted with the toy.  She began role-playing with the dinosaurs right away.  "I love you very much," said the mama dinosaur to her baby.  Supercute

She is so cute! I love the real hair, I've made loads of crazy designs. Also, I made a discovery, if you squeeze her tummy, she cries, falls asleep or says "I luv you mama"

This chart has been an excellent way for our children to track their daily progress towards completing their weekly chores and an excellent way to begin the work for allowance process. Only draw back there really isn't enough room to track chores for more than one child

This is a GREAT way to get your child(ren) to do the things that need to be done around the house.  I purchased two, one for each of my older children and they love that they have control over keeping up with the board. It is easy for them to use and easy for you to keep track of their progress.

I just bought this yesterday and surprised my girls (3 and 5)  with it today.  It does blow tons of bubbles!  They love chasing them all over the yard.  The Gazillion bubble solution that comes with it is cool because the bubbles are really colorful when they come out.  It does used 8 AA batteries as previously mentioned but there is an order from inside to send away for an adaptor.  Yes, it has a plug for an adaptor to plug it in so you don't use so many batteries.  Where I'll plug it in in the backyard I'm not sure yet.  I definitely recommend for the young children that are so excited by bubbles

This thing is great. Our 4 year old loves it.  The working drawbridge, breakaway wall for cannon fire and trap door are great.  Considering the size and number of pieces, it was remarkably easy to put together.  Allow 2 to 3 hours for assembly, but the directions are excellent.  Only complaint is that some of the small pieces that don't always want to stay together - some of the "details" will likely be missing after a few weeks.  Overall, very happy with it

My son received this toy as a present from his father on Christmas (Dec '05) and he was able to play with it straight out of the box.  I bought my son the V Smile system and he can't use that as easily as he uses the read with me system.  While a agree with some of the previous reviews that this system would not take him to seven years old, it does build his confidence level and keeps him motivated to keep playing because he was getting the answers right.  While with the V smile system he prefers I play and he watch. So I am happy with this purchase and will buy more DVDs for the system.  I have  only one complaint and that is  I wish they would use both traditional stories and use some of the newer characters.  My son loves Thomas the train and even though he has the little engine that could I think he would also like to see Thomas the Tank Engine, Dora the Explorer, and maybe even some books in foreign languages.  But all in all a great system for the younger preschool children.

This is easy to use, fun to play and I like the stories that are available. I think you get a great product for a great price

This is a must-have item if you want to add the Clock Tower to your set.  It also works well with the other "elevation" sets, particularly Mile High Mountain.

The set includes the following:

4 ramps (these are made from two shorter pieces that are screwed together)
2 curves
2 short straights
2 guard rails
2 end ramps
8 arches (2 supports and 1 crosspiece each)

The crosspieces of the arches have a picture of how the ends of the track should be aligned.  The screws are a little tough but never need to be removed.  The set is enough to run up two full levels and back down again (my son has played with this set just by itself having fun running up, around and racing back down).  You can also make two single-level bridges, a single level bridge and a ramp down from Mile High Mountain, or many other setups.

This set literally adds a new dimension to a Geotrax set.  Lots of fun.  The short pieces also allow for different configurations that may have been frustrating in the past.  Definitely fun.

There are so many great things about this that I don't know where to start.  Availability--price--shipping--the list goes on and on.  Bottom line is that my daughter is a big Care Bear fan and it's impossible to find this bear anywhere else.  It arrived quickly, was just as described (in fact it was softer) and occupies a place of honor on my daughter's bed.  I give it a 5, only because that's the highest.  Makes a wonderful gift!!

This doll looks like it will be a collectible in a few years. The Lucy in Paris Barbie is already worth more than double what it was selling for a few years ago. This doll will probably go up in value as well. In regards to the person who returned this doll twice for a slightly dented box...GET A LIFE! Who in the hell would return a doll just because the box had a dent! If the doll wasn't damaged why are you returning it????
It's life, nothing's perfect, GET OVER IT! You can't expect perfection...as long as the item itself isn't damaged there's no reason to make a big fuss over the cardboard box it comes in! This is a nice doll (even if the box is dented) and I would recommend purchasing it. I ordered this doll and the box mine came in was in good shape (to me anyway). As far as I know, buyers on ebay aren't extremely picky on the condition of the box...they are more concerned on the condition of the doll and whether or not it is still in the box.

I'm not sure why so many of these (all?) reviews are for a different product, but this one is actually for the balancing bike. We got this for our son for Christmas and he loves it. He just turned 5 and has a bike with training wheels but it's still too big for him. I don't really like the idea of training wheels anyway so I started looking for something like this balancing bike. I saw a German one for $350 so I was thrilled to find this one for under $100.

It was so easy to assemble. I love that the seat height adjusts. My son rides it around the house and after just a few tries was able to coast down the hall on it with his feet off the floor. I think it's a much better way to learn to ride a bike.

The quality is good, the seat has a bit of padding, and I expect it will hold up well for my other child when she's old enough to ride it in a couple more years.

I gave it four stars instead of five because it's put together with screws, it's not fine craftsmanship. Best buy in its category though

I loved this trike!  It was given to my son for his first birthday and he loved it.  Daycare was in walking distance (I lived in the city) and I used the trike to take him.  My son loved to hold onto the handle bars, it gave him a sence of freedom from the stroller that he hated.  My son is now three years old and I am buying a new one for my one year old. I understand some people give this product bad reviews but there is a 1-800 number that goes with the toy.  The brand  Radio Flyer is well known and the customer service line is very helpful and willing to replace parts or defects.  This is the only gift that was given to my son that I can say "I LOVE" and have had for more than just one year!  Enjoy

We recently purchased this playhouse, and discovered that it does not come with the peek-a-boo shutters (I don't see the shutters in the photo either although they are mentioned in the product description).  Our 3year old and 18 month old both enjoy it, but I would say it is more fun for the 18 month old than my 3 year old since there is little to actually "do" inside the house.  The doorbell makes fun sounds.  It is very easy to put together

I give this 4 stars, because I like it (maybe more than my toddler). When I was in kindergarten or 1st grade, my little brother, who was 1 or 2 at the time, had the original -- the one that just popped, and he loved it.  He would push it around until the popping drove my father "crazy." This one does even more.  It pops, counts from 1 to 10, plays music, and has flashing lights.  I think it's an awesome toy, especially for the price.  My daughter doesn't play with it every day, but when she grabs it, she'll push it around for maybe 10 minutes or more (we haven't found a single toy that will occupy her attention for longer than that).  Sometimes, she'll push it around several times a day.  It's great for that stage when your toddler likes to push or drag things around with them.  The popping was inconsistent when we first received it, but we took it apart, got the gears aligned correctly (through trial & error), added more Vaseline to the gears for lubrication, and now it pops, counts, plays music, and the lights flash consistently every time.  If you take this toy apart, be careful not to pull out the speaker wires -- we did that, but it was no problem.  My husband soldered the wires back together

I bought this game two weekends ago and have had both fun and frustration with it.  I'm a Freecell junkie and have gone so far as to download a better version (more games) than the one that came with my computer.  I lost track of how many total games I've played over the years since I've used several computers, but I play about 10 games a day on average.  I'm very competitive and love keeping track of my stats.  Unfortunately, that is the weakness of this version of the game.  For example, if you get into a position were you can move only one card back and forth between two columns and there are no other moves, all you can do is hit the replay button or move on to another game.  If you hit the replay button you don't get a loss recorded, which of course you should.  Consequently, it is easy to run up a high win percentage with this version of the game just by resigning a game when you think you are going to loose and replay it.  Then when you finally win, you get credit for a win.  Of course, that is not proper scoring either.  Also, there is a key combination that when you do lose a game outright and want to replay, you don't get any further losses counted against you.  That's as it should be.  The only problem is that key combination is very flaky and doesn't always work.  Other than scoring inconsistencies, it's a great game!  It's very easy to use.  Although different to use than playing with a mouse on your computer, if you've played a lot on your computer you'll pick up the operation of this version almost immediately.  The display is large and easy to see, and there is a low light level sensor on the front that will automatically light the screen when you are playing in an area with poor lighting.  That is a great feature.  I love playing this game while sitting in the airport waiting to board a plane and on the plane itself while in the air.  It's a great and challenging way to pass the time away if you like playing solitaire.  On the next version of this game, I hope they will beef up the statistics capabilities of the unit

This is the third or fourth Quixo game we have purchased to give as a gift!  We originaly recieved ours as a gift about 5 years ago and it has been a favorite ever since.  Quixo is tic tac toe with pieces that move.  You have a strategy, then oops, your opponent chages it all with one move. It is suitable for anyone from age 8 to adult.  We keep ours out at all times - a coffee table game.  It is very high quality with real wooden blocks as playing pieces.  Enjoy!

We have this product and LOVE it!  At first we had a problem with the hooves not working.  I called the number on the box.  They were wonderful and sent me new hooves at no expense or item return.  Then I find it was user error!  Santa didn't realize there were buttons in the heel of the hoof that push down when walking.  I called the company back and they told me not to worry about the exta hooves they sent.  To enjoy.  I would order from them again

 This is without a doubt the best [...] we have spent on a toy for our 7-year-old son, but it isn't a toy. It's a highly functional, albeit inexpensive, metal detector. We've had it now for 3 years and take it camping, etc.
It will easily find something as small as a rusty staple, and will detect a railroad spike as far as 4 1/4 inches down, very good if you consider how small the detection coil is. When camping the kids love to find and dig up ancient tent stakes, rusty nails, and the occasional coin.
Adjusting the sensitivity is trivial, just hold it away from any metal, and turn the sensitivity knob until the red detector LED just goes out. Other reviewer has noted that the three-piece shaft breaks easily, which happened on ours, but a little duct tape goes a long way and this shouldn't stop you from buying one.
If you get one, make sure to bury some coins and other treasures in the garden for the kids to find.
PS It also really works great for locating studs and plumbing pipes in walls

After three years of dragons who walk on all fours, we get a dragon who stands upright.  Seems kind of strange.  Thoron's debut appearance was in the "Fire & Ice" Portal Of Fire set.  He makes another appearance here in The Metal Ages, and he looks a lot meaner here.  Perhaps the rigors of battle are wearing on him.  I bought Stendhal first and was very pleased with him.  I found Thoron to be somewhat disappointing.  He's got some great detail, but he's not as articulated as Stendhal is.  Replacing the standard light-up feature is a dragon roar feature.  Thoron doesn't light up, but he has a variety of growls and roars that are activated by a button on his chest.

His articulation is pretty decent.  His hind legs (which he stands on) are stiff and can only move back and forth.  But it gets much better when we examine his arms and head.  His arms can move back and forth, and away from his body.  The shoulder joint can move in two directions.  We get two additional points of articulation at the elbows and wrists.  Thoron's wrists aren't as versatile as Stendhal's are (Stendhal's wrists can turn in addition to the claw moving back and forth).  His neck can move left and right, and his head can move in all manner of directions.  As always, his jaw opens.  His tail is flexible for super-posability, as are his towering wings.  He can also turn at the waist.  My complaints with Thoron's articulation are twofold.  It would've been nicer if his hind legs were posable, and it definitely would've been nice if his wrists were articulated like Stendhal's are.

Thoron is mostly dark green with white highlights on his wings, white claws on his feet, and silver colored armor.  As mentioned, the detail here is better than ever, and everything has a realistic look.  He comes with a removable piece of armor for his head.  I think he looks better without it, but maybe that's just me.  Thoron is one of the most charismatic dragons I've seen (it's all in the face and eyes).  He looks kind of mean and vicious.  Stendhal is supposed to be the bad guy, and he doesn't look this mean.  The original Thoron from the Fire & Ice series has a better facial expression.

This action figure comes almost completely assembled.  I just had to attach his wings.  Also included are some parts for building a small tower with decorative blades and flag, and a Draigar warrior with shield and weapon.

All things considered, Thoron isn't quite as nice as Stendhal is.  Nevertheless, he gets a thumbs up from me.  He's a good addition to any dragons collection and a fun action figure to play around with

My 9 month old son LOVES this toy!  It's easily his favorite toy.  He'll gladly do tummy time hitting the piano keys and hitting the dial and characters.  He has a great time making it go, and will now sit up and scoot the car a little.  His other toys were good for a couple weeks at best, this one he only seems to be enjoying more the longer he plays with it.  The music is not nearly as loud or as annoying as most toys and is actually a little fun. Well worth the purchase price

Pixter is a fantastic learning tool for ages 3+. As a parent, I love that many of the learning activities are based around drawing and creating so the child is not only gaining knowledge but also creating art at the same time. My son who will be 2 in a few weeks has a Pixter, and though he is far below the age recommendation, he absolutely adores drawing with his Pixter. He is very gentle with it and it can keep him entertained for hours.

Compared to the LeapFrog Leapster, Pixter has many more creativity-based activities and Leapster tends to be more of an arcade-style system. However, the Leapster cartridges are much easier to find and there is a bigger selection of titles. I plan to purchase the Leapster for my son for his 3rd birthday because the L-MAX can play games on the TV as well as on the handheld.

Also, contrary to popular belief, the Pixter is NOT being discontinued as of this writing. I spoke with a representative at Fisher Price myself and she said that they are redesigning the system with new colors but not discontinuing it or any of the software. Beware when purchasing these games on eBay for ridiculous prices from people claiming they are discontinued. Wait for the stores to restock after the holidays and it will be a different story

We have this up on the wall for our baby and use it as a diaper changing night light.  The luminosity is just right for changing baby but is not too blinding for sleepy eyes.   My 9-year daughter also loves to cycle through the phases before bedtime. 

The room has to be very bright for the night light to turn off automatically.  The remote is very handy and we liked the 3 viewing options.

We'll be getting this as gifts for our friends and their babies.

This is the first RC (radio control) aircraft I have ever flown, although I have raced RC cars for quite awhile. It comes fully assembled with a nice manual and even a quick intro DVD to get you in the air quickly. 

I started out in my living room and it has worked just great. With just a little trimming out the heli is very stable and easy for which to get a feel. I've run it for a few hours now with no incidents and I'm getting pretty good at hovering although I still have a tough time with head-in flight (controls thus reversed).

The Blade CX RTF makes a great first heli or just a great indoor heli. Probably fine for anyone over 10 years old. I am getting 10-15 minutes of flight time on a battery charge. The only disappointment is that charging a battery takes 60-90 minutes (typical with all LiPo batteries). I'd recommend getting an extra battery or two and maybe even an extra powersupply and charger. Also I have tried the Training Gear add-on for the Blade CP/CP Pro -- it fits the CX just fine and allows you to use it later if you move on -- and it helps with damage but makes the Blade CX slightly less stable in hover in my opinion but not terribly so. They're probably worth the trade off at first.

In a few more hours I think I'll be ready to move up to the Blade CP Pro. Highly recommended for anyone interested in entering RC helicopters or who just wants a heli to fly around the house.

Two good sites for further info are [...]

We have the original &quot;Super Mastermind&quot; which is the exact same layout.  It's fun and enjoyable year after year but too many games at one sitting can cause a headache.  It's fun to watch others work at it too.  The pieces are small so should be kept away from little kids but age 10 and up seem to enjoy it.  It's a great addition to our game shelf and we are getting more to give as gifts

We just got this for my daughter's 5th Birthday. This toy was what received the greatest excitement. While opening presents, my daughter exclaimed at the the top of her lungs, "I got a Brietta Pegasus!" The pegasus itself is durable, beautiful, and creatively sparks hours of imaginitave play. I didn't think it was a big deal trying to get it out of the box. Many toys are packaged that way these days... Perhaps an anti-theft plan. I just got some scissors and Brietta was out to play. So far we also haven't had any trouble with the wings. If they do fall out occasionally- they pop right back in. A small price to pay for such a well-loved toy that my 5 year old plays with for hours. As a mom who also loved unicorns and Pegasus ponies as a girl, I'm glad I can give that magic to my own girls

THIS TOY IS GREAT FOR MANY REASONS!! Tengamo are collectible gaming magnets with funny characters. You get 6 in a pack and really cool stickers! Each character has point value and rarity. If you're lucky, you might get one of the very rare Tengamos and sell it for $$$$ on Ebay! You can also play hundreds of games with the Tengamo magnet special design and little steel ball that comes in the pack. Hurry to collect all of Series 1 before it is "retired" for Series 2.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

I went online to look for other Little Tikes toys with the handle and saw that this truck - which my 17-month old son loves - only had two stars and I wondered why. I disagree with most of the other reviews. The handle on top makes it easy for him to push around and carry - he can run it up slopes, on the ground, anywhere. He has never fallen or injured himself on it. In fact his frustration occurs because he can only pull the dump truck end up about 50% of the time. Usually he just hands it to me, and points that he wants it open. I do agree that the handle does make it difficult to put large items in the back and that the opening at the end of the dump truck makes it difficult for items to fall out. This is the only reason I'm not giving this toy five stars. But my son loves this truck and has pretty much been playing with it constantly since we got it about a month ago. I'm planning to get him the train with the handle because he likes this toy so much.

We stretched it across our pool but we have a stoper in the line so you fall in the pool. we just used some special clamps and a high compression spring. The kids love it because they can fly right into the pool

It's cute, well packaged and easy (but time consuming) to put together.  For the price it can't be beat.  Too bad there's no photo.  She'll use it for a while and we'll sell it online when we are done and probably get most of our money back

This is the perfect size swimming pool for my 21 month old. She loves this pool. I love the fact that only the top ring has to be blown up then once you start filling it with water - it stands up. Less risk of tears or holes! The only thing I would recommend would be some sort of cover for it since it does not come with one

My daughter got this pool for her first birthday and she loves it.  This pool is big enough that I can just get in with her and we have a blast.  Because of her age I don't fill it up all the way and it still works just fine. (it just looks a little funny) I found it really easy to set up and easy enough to pack away.  I was a little confused at first when folding it up but within moments I had it put away and every time I use it I find it easier and easier. This pool is great for traveling to Grandma's house too!  I would recommend this to anyone young and old

When my 3-month old nephew received this for Christmas, my 15-month old and 3-year old immediately started fighting over it.  They played with it so much that we decided to buy our own, even though I thought they might be too old for it.  Two months later, it is still the hottest toy in our house.  The shapes are vibrant colors, rattle, and have rounded edges, making them easier than most shape sorters for younger children.  The top and bottom pieces screw off to remove the shapes, and my 3-year old can take them on and off herself.  My kids also like to lay the top and bottom pieces on the floor and set the shapes on them like it is a puzzle.   They also like to play "catch" by rolling the sorter back and forth to each other.  I would say this is one of the best toys you can buy for a 6-18 month old

I wanted my daughter to be able to listen to music without headphones.  This product, the FP3 Speakers, was perfect.  She loves to walk around from room to room singing her favorite songs and carrying this around.  It is easy to turn on and very kid friendly.  The only downfall is that the price dropped right after I purchased it!

This game is make-involve, make-think and fun. Side effects leave you much smarter. Its fun game for parties driving everyone to involvement and fun. 

Art of asking questions and elimination gets better and better just by playing this game !!!!!. Strongly recommended for parents who want their kids to spend time on creative and learning game, yet fun. They can be be part of game and share there thoughts. Though it recommends age 10+ might as well be good for 7+ to 100+ ..."

I wish I had this game little earlier, never stop telling how much its fun and good for personality development!!

This is a game that will help you practice, while you are having fun, to ask the right questions, to zero in on the answer and at the same time keeping tab of the progress. I believe it is the right questions that you ask that help you succeed in a game or in life.This is a game with a educational value that will enhance your creative thinking with a dose of fun.If you liked Pictionary you will love Questionary.

IF I BUY HER SHE WILL BE WEARING A NEW SHIRT RIGHT AWAY. OTHER THAN THAT SHE'S A LOVELY DOLL. AND I, LIKE THE PREVIOUS REVIEWER, ALSO REMEMBER AND LOVE THE ARCHIE COMICS FROM MY CHILDHOOD.

We purchased this set for my son Christmas 2003.  He loves it.  The age range on the listing is off, though.  It should be the same for any of the Little People toys - 12 or 18 months and up.  There are no small parts.  Highly recommended and fun during the holidays or any time

We  bought two sets of the Alphabet Foam Play Mats - so glad we did!  We have a concrete basement floor, and now the kids have a nice, colorful, and soft place to play.  Plus, the foam floor isn't as cold as the concrete - wer're in Colorado.  The colors are great - so inviting.  The pieces fit together perfectly, and the border gives it a finished look.  Great purchase!  We'll probably buy more so that we can increase the size of the play area!

I added this toy to my son's xmas list. With much luck he did get it; and we are pleased ! I would not say that it's a "fun to play with" toy but the entertainment value still exists. The planets are large enough without being overbearing up on the ceiling. They glow at night..which is the best part !! At 36 years old I can't wait for  nighttime to hang in my sons room to check out the  planets!  The stars the set comes with are perfect. They are NOT the bulky plastic ones that can be seen day or night. They are paper stickers that disappear during the day (on the celing they do anyway) The planets come with name stickers which adds educational value. My son is five and LOVES, LOVES, LOVES these planets. I say get 'em !!

My nephew who is 3 years old got My First LeapPad not to long ago and he loves it. He loves train so he got one that is Thomas the train and he playes it the morning when he get up and at night before he goes to sleep. There are many different types, and they are everywhere you just have to know where to look. For instance [...] Over all I think this is an amazing learning toy for toddler and young kids who look forward to reading and writting.

I really like My first leap pad and so does my 3 year old son.
 I bought it for him for Christmas last year (he was 2 1/2 then)and though some the activities we're alittle hard for him to start with, there were still plenty of things he could do with it.Every picture you touch the pen on says a frase/says the name of the object or make a sound,so even without playing the games he still had great fun with it.
 A year on,he can now play all the games on it and has recently noticed letters make words,so now he touches the words and the leap pad reads it for him,so he is still learning from this toy after a year!
 I will be buying more my first leap pad books for him this Christmas,this toy is worth every penny

Got this as a gift and it was one of the first things she "played" with, well more like laid and stared at.  Now she's 4 1/2 months old and she still loves it.  She loves to grab at the fish, shake the rattle and twirl the lobster.  For awhile, it was a whole new toy every week because she would notice something new on it.  Great for putting her down and keeping her entertained while mom grabs a bite to eat.  Also good to take places because of the hard plastic bottom.  Music isn't too annoying either

This is a very pretty doll. I waited until this year to buy her and got her for only fifteen dollars. In my opinion that is the only way to buy these fancy dolls--ON SALE! Otherwise they are just too darn expensive. I give this particular doll 4 stars. She has a pretty face and I like her hair. I think the dress is a bit overdone but that is just me.

I bought the African-American 2005 Holiday Barbie for my little girl.  I agree with her statement that "She's too pretty to play with!!".  Mattel did an amazing job this year.  The face on this doll is EXQUISITE. "Miss 2005" is absolutely proportionate in classic Barbie terms. The gown's colors definitely put you in a festive spirit.  In fact, the ball gown, as a whole, is supernaturally beautiful.  Picking Bob Mackie as this year's designer was nothing short of GENIUS.  When I saw that Mackie was the HOLIDAY designer, I knew that Mattel had finally gotten it right!

I don't have the tin version but an earlier version.  The cards look different but the game is played the same.  I have been playing this with my now current 10 year old for 2 years and we both love it.  A little luck, some strategy, and a whole lot of fun.  Don't let the age levels fool  you-adults will enjoy this as well.  A classic that will never go out of style

My 4 1/2 year old recieved this red engine last Christmas, and for the first couple of months was used practically every day. (And yes, I agree with the rest of the reviewers- buy rechargable batteries since this engine eats them, and prepare to be disappointed since it cannot pull many cars up the hills without getting stuck.) I will tell you that I cannot BELIEVE my son has not touched this engine since. His complaint is that all it does is go around and around. Instead, he enjoys playing out stories from Thomas, or making up his own train sagas. My husband likes to watch the engine more than my son. I don't know how other children play with their trains, but the battery operated engines just cannot hold his attention for very long. Nevertheless, for the first few months, watching it is really mesmerizing, I could watch it for hours. Perhaps instead of buying this one engine, purchase a setup with more cars and track for the same money. It will probably get more use in the end

Why people purchase a toy for tikes when it is specifically targeted at older kids is beyond me. Always look at the box for the minimum age a toy is best for. That said, all LTTO taggers, including this one, have a simple "grab and go" game called LTAG. All you have to do is pull the trigger twice and you're on your way. This is early in the manual, way before all the complicated games that frustrate 6 year olds and their parents.

I love LTTO. I even run a club that uses it here in Auburn, WA. But I *always* start new players out with LTAG, then move up to hosted games, and then to the more complicated games. Never try to start out by hosting a team Hide and Seek game, 'cus it's just too much for a young or completely new player. But that's why the LTAG game exists! Just grab it and play! No messing with the control panel.

Don't take a low rating based on an inapproprate purchase as worth much. Similarly, take my rating with a grain of salt since I'm a huge fan. But for kids 8 and up to adults, LTTO taggers are a wonderful, durable, and long lived toy that gets you moving AND thinking

It would be easier to keep score on a book that is not glossy or bound; ink smears, pencil does not show up, and writing in the crease is difficult.  They should include a score book similar to the typical baseball scoring books; spiral bound, paper.  Other than that, the product is exactly what we were looking for.

I purchased this card game as a spur of the moment christmas gift for my son who loves monopoly but can get no one to play the board game because of how long the board game version takes. My son as well as the rest of the family was wonderfully surprised to find this monopoly card game addictive and fun to play.  Each of the hands goes quickly and the goal of $10000 is very attainable to reach in a fairly short period of time. I will have to admit 3 people was a bit more challenging and fun than just 2 and we decided it would be easier to keep score of the money by using pencil, paper, and a calculator. Overall, I highly recommend this version

My 2.5 year old Border Collie just loves the tunnel and we train with it a few times per week.  Since the agility tunnels for dogs are a bit pricey, I decided to try this more affordable kid's tunnel instead. It's not as heavy and robust as the official agility tunnels, but it has been serving me great for just about a year - there's just some minor wearing around the rings and small toe nail runs in it - but it's still very usable.  

My ratings would change a bit for kids though - probably a 3 for educational and 5 for durability

I've read the other reviews...as I was skimming the website to order another of these wands.  Guess you folks had a bad batch of wands, because my son is crazy about his.  We gave it to him shortly after his 2nd birthday, and it's one of his favorite toys!  Yes, it is messy...it's a giant bubble wand...when was the last time you played bubbles that there wasn't a mess?  But if you keep it out doors, I don't see the problem.  My son was able to make bubbles right away (something he wasn't able to do with smaller wands since he can't seem to blow (he sucks air in instead of out).  His father and I played for over an hour with this wand...taking turns making the bubbles and letting him pop them (and vice versa).  I don't know why the other folks had some difficulty...but I would highly recommend this toy for a 2-3 year old.

We wanted to purchase more traditional toys for our daughter for christmas 06.  We bought a lot of M&D toys and this by far was the better of their toys.  Even though our daughter is still a little young to put pieces together properly it will be even better when she figures this out.  Like other said the sound is very appropriate.  I like this toy and definitely recommend this to others. The only reason I gave it a 4 is colors on blocks could be a bit brighter or more colorful

My mother-in-law purchased the sandbox for my son, who was not quite two at the time.  He has played with it everday for the last four months straight.  I can't even hide it from him.  He loves filling the sandbox with other trucks that he has.  This toy keeps him occupied for hours.  He has so much fun with it that we are using others for his second birthday

This is a great (and relatively cheap) way to expand your Brio starter set.  A nice selection of straights, curves, and a few switch tracks that really add to the interaction / fun.  

While Brio in general is expensive, this track pack represents a pretty good value (v. buying switches, curves, straights, etc on their own.... although you'll "need" to do that eventually too!).

The finish, fit, and quality is great.  Worth the money considering the play it'll get & it's durability

Great idea to hang clothes. The hangers are not long enough to keep the clothes on.  If your child is like mine who loves to dress and re-dress dolls, the armoire is not big enough if you purchase more then 3 outfits. The price is great now. I paid $20.  Great item just wish it was a little bigger maybe even a drawer.

My son loves this game.  When moving around the tracks, in the one game it can be difficult, the key is if you moving up or down, depending on which direction you need to go, push the joystick the direction once and let go, after that push the joystick the direction the train needs to go. I hope this helps.  My son will be 3 in less then a month and it took him a week to figure out how to move around the tracks.  Mom, dad and sis had to play before that.  The other games are a little easier, but I found the games educational and my son loves it

My child loves this little crib.  I think the canopy was the winning feature and the rollers.  She can easily move it without having to carry it to the next room.   All her dolls fit the crib.  We really think it works.  It isn't as sturdy as a wooden crib, but it hasn't come apart on us

This is an awsome ship! Well at least Anakins is. My cousin has a green Anakin jedi starfighter and I want to get the new Obi-wan Kenobi one that is coming in September. The only thing that is not good about it is that there is a little opening in the cockpit that Anakin's hand (the Green ship comes with an Anakin that has a normal hand and one holding a lightsaber) fell through

I bought a set of these Uno cards for my 9-year-old grandson, a Nintendo "freak." The first night he had them he played three games with whoever was handy, and spent an hour alone arranging the cards just so. He took them to bed with him. A few days later he dashed into his other grandparent's house showing off his fancy deck of Uno cards and insisted that they play a game. He even wrote us a Thank You note telling us that the cards were the "coolest present I ever got."

The rules of the game have not changed, just the look of the cards. Nintendo characters, in all their bright colors, are the "suits." The cards are housed in a metal box, a throwback to the front half of the 20th Century. Excellent art work on the cards and on the box.

The cards and the game are appealing to all ages. I enjoyed playing and getting acquainted with the Nintendo characters (my grandson explained them all to me). This is a great family game and this Nintendo set is a great gift. It helps close the "generation gap." I highly recommend this item. Enjoy.

One last thing: I bought a second deck for another grandson and his response was pretty much the same.

Now you can add Risk to your libary in this handsome bookshelf edition.  The game remains a perennial favorite, and in this day and age of global conquest you can play out your vicarious need to be king of the world without harming anyone, atleast not physically.  But, be prepared for a few bruised egos, especially when combatants start teaming up on weaker victims.  While the places and names don't exactly match today's geographical boundaries, kids can still get some sense of the world in which we live, even if the object of the game remains to wipe each other out

Love this game. With family and/or friends it's one of the best card games around. It is easy and doesn't require a lot of attention (you can watch movies, talk, hang out, etc.) yet keeps your interest. It's also a game people of many ages can play because it's not too difficult. A good card game for having friends over to play over dinner or while watching a ballgame.

I found that for the price. this set was great!  It comes with one Rascus figure, and one shadow knight.  The catapult is very orginal, and powered by a rubber band, I got it to go 3 and a half feet.  There were also some improvements in the pieces.  For example, the flagpole was less annoying, the weapons were improved, and the head pieces came on and off much smoother. 

Whether you are starting Lego Castle or are an expert builder, this is great set

We just got this lego system for our 3 year old son and he loves it!  He doesn't want to put it away or out of his sight at any time.  The Scoop and Lofty characters are easy for him to assemble and we are working on the little buildings, but he may not be quite old enough yet to assemble them.  Overall, this is a great toy for anyone who loves Bob the Builder.  We can't wait to purchase the other sets to add to the fun!!  Lego always makes great and challenging toys!

You need to be old enough to look at a set of several horse cards and decide which kind of horse show a particular hose would do best in and which horse you would get the most points for if you had that particular horse compete in a dressage show, jumper show, ect. points are added up and who evers horse earned the most points wins that horse show and that player gets to keep the cards. So I would say ages 8 to 12, but younger children could play with help from someone who can read and add up numbers. 

There is a limited amount of rounds in a game, since there is a limited number of cards to play for each horse show so the game last around 15 minutes or so. I like this part a lot, since games like war "Chomp" can go on forever.

It does take a table top to play the game, I originally purchased the game for my daughter thinking she could play it on the bus with a friend, but you need to have a surface to lay out some cards. I quess you could try to squeeze them onto a larger text book laid onto your lap. But it wouldn't be easy.

I bought this as a Halloween gift for my then 3 year old son in 2004.  He loved its spooky sounds and the neat turns and tricks in the house.  He doesn't really use it much anymore, but now my 18 month old loves it!  He can actually follow the whole progression, turning and pulling levers and platforms at the right time.  This toy has been great for our family.  It is pretty durable, some pieces are not quite as smooth as they once were and the pop out skeleton at the bottom is not working anymore, but considering what it has gone through, it has performed amazingly well

Well, I just think that the little beauty on the cover easily sells this product.  Can you even imagine her tooting?  She's too cute!  The slick gentleman blowing on the whistle like it's a saxophone and he plays in a be-bop quartet of fart blowers makes me wonder if he is blowing out both ends.  This thing is going to sound like a true to life fart...but without all the hassle of the smell.  One warning...do not use this whistle on your key chain as an emergency device.  Please use a real loud whistle.  You wouldn't want to be alone in an empty parking garage with some ghoulish thug chasing you and then you just start blowing your fart whistle to get someone to come to your aid.  If I heard farts in an empty parking garage I would most likely run the other way.  This whistle is for good times only.

Toby is one of the regulars on the Thomas & His Friends TV series, and this little wooden tram engine is well-made and durable for those who have the wooden railway sets.

My only complaint - and this is very minor - is that Toby is a bit taller than other wooden Thomas engines, meaning that he cannot fit under bridges very well

My 7 year old son got this set for Christmas last year, and with all the toys we have for our 5 kids, this K'nex set gets the most use.  He built with it every day for months, and still builds something new about every week with it.  He has built about every model in the book and he is getting better at building his own ideas.  We've gotten a lot of the models on video tape, and he loves to show his grandparents the new ones.  I loved the sea turtle that "walked" across the floor, and he builds amusement park rides and puts little people in them.  This thing keeps him busy for hours at a time, and he's getting another tub of them for his birthday.  His little brother wants one for his birthday this year.  The motor is very cool, and he figures out how to use it with the models that don't call for it.  Since Christmas, he has only broken 2 pieces, so I thought that was pretty good.  Highly recommended

If you know the movies inside and out, this game is fun for the dedicated fan.  I play with my son that knows so much more Star Wars trivia than I do but find the game enjoyable.  The only minor annoyance is when you land on a pie question too many times, the DVD portion of the game runs out of questions and tells you to use a question from the card deck.  Not sure why they could not load up more questions on the DVD but maybe the game is not intended for a poor old Mom that answers so many questions wrong

Star Wars Trivial Pursuit Saga Edition (2005.)

INTRODUCTION:
Despite having been around since the middle of the seventies, the Star Wars series has never declined in its popularity. George Lucas created a science fiction phenomenon that has stood the test of time, and then some. And needless to say, many games have been based on the series - video games, role-playing games, and no shortage of board games have been adapted for the Star Wars universe. In 1998, Star Wars Trivial Pursuit was released. Being a die-hard fan of the series, it was by far my favorite (non video game) Star Wars game ever. Unfortunately, it outdated fast, due to the fact that it didn't cover the prequel trilogy it was immediately followed by. But in 2005, seven years and three Star Wars episodes later, a new version of the game has hit store shelves! Read on for my review of the new version of Star Wars Trivial Pursuit.

OVERVIEW:
Quite honestly, who doesn't know what Trivial Pursuit is? Well, for those of you who have been living under a rock all your life, here's the concept behind the game. Players alternate rolling a die and moving their game token across a wheel-shaped board. There are six different-colored spaces. Each color represents a different category. The player is then asked a question of that category. If he or she gets it right, he or she goes again. If he or she misses it, it's the next player's turn. At six spots on the board are wedge spaces. The objective of the game is to gain a wedge in all six colors and return to the central hub of the wheel, and answer a game-winning question. Some changes for this edition of the game are, rather obviously, the questions and overall game design being Star Wars based, and two DVDs, which contain the wedge and game-winning questions. A new concept to the game includes a player being able to "steal" if another player is unable to answer the wedge question, in the last few seconds of time. Essentially, the game play stays play to the classic stylings of Trivial Pursuit, but gives it a Star Wars overhaul. In other words, this game is exactly what it says it is.

REVIEW:
The original Star Wars Trivial Pursuit was, without question, my favorite Star Wars game of all time that wasn't a video game. This new version is a MASSIVE improvement over the old version. For starters, the new version covers the ENTIRE Star Wars film saga. The classic Galactic Civil War trilogy (Episodes IV, V and VI) AND the prequel Clone Wars trilogy (Episodes I, II, and III) all get equal emphasis. If you hated the original version for not covering the prequel trilogy, that problem has, obviously, been corrected, and in a major way. The DVDs also add a nice new twist to the game. It's good to finally have a method of setting the wedge questions apart from regular questions. And, of course, you can do anywhere from two to four players or teams. I do have a few minor complaints, though. First of all is the selection of the tokens of characters you can play as. The original version had Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, and Darth Vader. In other words, a nice assortment of main characters. The new version has Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Yoda. In other words, ONLY JEDI CHARACTERS. This is strictly a cosmetic flaw, but still, I think they could have picked a better assortment of characters than those four. Another complaint is the inclusion of a die. For those of you who never played the original version of the game, it included an electronic R2D2 figurine which would tell you how many spaces to move when you tapped its head, via an LCD screen. I liked that better than rolling a die because it helped to give the game a unique Star Wars feel that playing with a die just doesn't have. Another problem is the price of the game - I've seen it everywhere from $45 to $60! Even at the lowest MSRP, it's still a rip off. One of the biggest problems is one of the most obvious - if you're not a die-hard Star Wars fan, you will not get very far in this game. My last and biggest complaint is with the questions themselves - like the original game, they are HORRIBLY imbalanced. Some questions are so simple, a casual fan could answer them easily. Some are so difficult, even die-hards will have trouble with them. This brings me to my complaint about the DVD questions. Not only are these questions really no more difficult than the card questions, but as time ticks down, the questions become EASIER! This makes it ridiculously easy for another player to "steal" the wedge if the question receiver is unable to answer. If I were designing the game, I'd straighten up these flaws. But I'm not, and overall, I am very satisfied with it. 

EDITION NOTES:
This game is a fairly recent release, and it remains readily available at most major stores that sell board-style games and movie merchandise. If you want the game, it shouldn't be too hard - just be ready to pay a fairly high price for it.

OVERALL:
Despite some minor issues, this new version of Star Wars Trivial Pursuit is a leaps-and-bounds improvement over the original game. If you're a huge fan of the series who thinks your knowledge of the series is supreme, don't hesitate to buy this game. There have been many Star Wars trivia games/books/etc. over the years, but Star Wars Trivial Pursuit is the ultimate Star Wars trivia experience. No fan should pass this game up

Even better than Scrabble, you build words on the board AND build words "up" by adding letters over existing words.  So "tree" becomes "free" and "braces" becomes "blades".  The scoring might be a little too easy, but if you're hard core, you can use the point values from Scrabble to raise the score difficulty.  The board is small so you have to start thinking up instead of out fairly soon into the game, and the game doesn't drag on for too long.  It is addictive and you will not look at words the same way again.

It's soo cute and cuddly! Not only is extra soft, it's small enough to fit in your palm or make a great addition to a desk. It looks realistic too, it had the little cat fur covering its eyes making it even more adorable, the only downside if you trying cuddling with it to go to sleep make sure you take out the "TY" tag otherwise you would end up with heart shape marks on your face=

I definitely can tell when a great game show can be fun as a board game. Unfortunately, that absolutely isn't always the case. One of my all time favorite quiz shows back in the 80's was Super Password with Bert Convy. The game of course showcases a celebrity and a regular contestant trying to guess their way to guess a mystery word for a puzzle. This edition doesn't reflect on that edition. This board game edition is a example of the original Password with the late Allen Ludden. The game is still fun and enjoyable for those who actually haven't seen the original Password like myself, but it is just delightful. Unfortunately, it isn't much fun reflecting on this version and relating to the Bert Convy edition. Hopefully, when Password is remade, it will be just like the themed 80's edition of the NBC game show.

Price: B-

Game: C 1/2+

Fun & Enjoyment: B-

This is a very good Webkinz as the plush and as the virtual pet. It comes with a rare TV and other supplies. it is also very soft. The only bad thing is the price. Don't buy Webkinz online, the price can go up to $50. The real Price is $11.99, which you can find them for that price in stores

sure this doesn't make the popular clanking sound going down the stairs as the metal originals, but it still works well, and has been copied by many companies.  I even have one with a business name on it.  These fun, functional, and keep a kids imagination engaged.  No noise or batteries needed.  Buy someone you know this for a stocking stuffer this year

My 9 month-old granddaughter likes her Christmas present of Octotune;  as a matter of fact, we played with this toy yesterday when I stayed with her.  It is colorful, she can grab the legs and the music is pleasing, so it stimulates more than one sense.

I bought this for my year old grandaughter and am more than pleased. It is very heavy so as the child stands up to play it does not move at all. The corners are rounded so there are no sharp points for the child to hurt themselves on. It will hold their attention for quite a while as there are five activities for them to play with. The price was very reasonable compaed to other similar products.

I bought this set for my grandsons 2nd birthday.  My son found it very easy to assemble and my daughter in law loves it because it is a lovely piece of furniture.  My grandson loves to sit at the table and look at books or build with blocks.  This is a sturdy set that will last for many years

I love Melissa and Doug toys, they're always well-made and always thoughtful. They encourage learning and their pieces, made of natural material, not only hold up well but are environmentally friendly. 

This game is a particularly nice example. It's a classic wooden puzzle with a twist. Each vehicle puzzle piece has a magnet on it and the players yank them out with a magnetic "tow truck".  Melissa and Doug have made two other puzzles similar to this, a fish puzzle and a butterfly puzzle, with the same concept.  This one, however, might appeal more to kids whose current fascinations lie more along the lines of cars and trucks.

One of our pieces (on the fishing version of this puzzle) did stick, but a quick rub around the edges with some sandpaper loosened it right up. The downside of using real materials is that wood does have a tendency to warp in humidity or dryness. That's a downside I'm willing to live with! Excellent toy!

I can't believe how well made this set is. I have been looking for good quality kitchen toys for my daughter for Christmas. I wanted something sturdy and not plastic. I just received my order today and these items are great! My son opened the box and tested them for his little sister and he can't wait to play with them with her. 
I ordered this set and the baking set and both are made out of solid wood and are extremely durable. I am very impressed and wish amazon carried the matching coffee pot and blender!

I also had a problem with the velcro on the butter.  It was an easy fix with some super glue.  I think the heat during the shipping made the velcro come off

If you are a hardcore Family Guy fan like me (I am actually one of the few people that watched Family Guy when it was originally on the air), you will not be disappointed with this Monopoly version. The box is beautifully designed with the Griffin family pictured on center, and some easter eggs to look around for. The board is not the most impressive one especially compared to The Simpson's and Muppets Monopoly versions but it is pretty nice with the Griffins at center. What you will love of the board is the properties, which include everything from Chris' Closet and Seamus' Lighthouse to James Woods High and Geronimo's Palace to The Clam and Channel 5 News to Mayor West's Mansion and finally Petoria, all from both old and new seasons plus some scenes from the Stewie's Untold Story movie. The property deeds are somewhat disappointing though. The do not have color watermarks like those found in the Simpson's version, but I guess they will do. 

Peter's Fishing Boat, Hinden-Peter, Peter-Copter and the Pope Mobile replace the Railroads. I bet you will not be laughing too much when you have to pay $200.00 (Income Tax) for Volcano Insurance or $75.00 for Workplace Sensitivity Training (Luxury Tax) but hey, you can't stay mad for long at the Salesman Guy, right? It would have been cool to have Joe Swanson on the Go To Jail space and have a picture of Quahog Prison on the jail space but well, what can you do? 

The Pewter Tokens are nice. You can chose from TV Junkie Peter, Mug in hand Brian, Nose picking Chris, Lois, Stewie in a high chair and Meg (who looks like a Peanut character). You can also order four more tokens that include The Giant Chicken, Quagmire, Joe and the Evil Monkey. 

The coolest changes are the Chance and Community Chest cards that are replaced by the What the Deuce! and Giggity! Giggity! Giggity! cards, respectively. They are beautifully done in full color and you will find things like; Made Sheriff of Bumblescum ADVANCE TO GO, Get Liposuction and Implants Pay $100, Confederate Civil War Veterans are After You Go Back 3 Spaces, Take Big Fat Paulie to The Movies as a Favor Collect $25.00, Help Death get a Girlfriend Collect $100, and many more. 

The money goes as follows $1 - Meg, $5 - Chris $10 - Lois, $20 - Brian, $50 - Stewie, $100 - Peter, $500 - The Griffins 

There are no special rules for this version, which is weird since it has been the norm for some time in these special Monopoly versions. 

To wrap it up I must say that even though they could have done a better job this is a beautiful and wonderfully done Monopoly game. Family Guy fans will love it making this a great gift. HAVE FUN

The build a figure (BAF) program of Marvel legends keeps on rocking.  This time build a giant 14" Apocalypse.  This BAF is big and cool, super articulated, with sculpt and paint fine enough to be a sculpture.  For Apocalypse 5 stars.

For Iron Fist...  Well he's super articulated and does come with the mighty booty (that's the buttocks) of Apocalypse, but really is the weakest figure in this series.  A lot of that is just charater design though.  Green tights with an open v-neck green shirt, and what is that tattoo supposed to be anyway, ballet slippers and a dew-rag?  Pretty horrible looking.  If you can, try to find the red suit variant, at least that's a little cool.  Also, the accesories (besides the booty) are two rubbery flames to fit into his hands to give a fire fist effect.  Good luck with that.  They are kind of flimsy and hard to place in the hands.  Once you get them in you better not touch the figure again or they will fall off.  Overall, not the quatlity of figure or accesories I'd expect.

But the rest of the figures in the series will make up for this one, plus you do still get that booty

we received this for my daughter's 4th birthday.  it has been a lot of fun to play--simple enough for her to play, and hard enough to grow with her for the past year.  although it has a lot of pieces, they have remained durable and have withstood tiny fingers.

My daughter received this for her 5th birthday and she absolutely loves it.  It combines the classic board and memory games together.  The pieces are made of very thick cardboard and are very durable.  The only small complaint is the spinner which tends to get stuck easily.  We have played this game multiple times each day since received and she is still excited everytime we open the box.  An excellent game!!

My 8 year old son LOVES this toy. He has spent many hours acting out the cartoon and loves that fact that the cape pops out at the push of a button and winds back in by moving a leg back and forth. He likes the food dish that shoots the disc. and also thinks the cryptonite is cool!!! It says it changes colors when warm, but we havent seen that. Maybe nn to run it under hot/cold water?! Overall a fantastic buy

This play tent is great - my son got it when he was 1 and still loves it a year later.  He brings toys in there and "hides" to play.  It is not unsafe, it will tip over at times, but it's so lightweight that it could not hurt him.  I think that it's a great buy for the money and would recommend it

My 3 1/2 year old son has older sisters with iPods and always wants to use them to listen to.  We bought this for him for Christmas and he calls it his iPod and he absolutely loves it.  We download new songs and stories from time to time as a reward.  We also bought the speakers for him to listen to stories or songs while going to sleep or just hanging out at home.

It's tough and durable and withstands being dropped and rough handling like a 3 year old dips out

I got this for my 6 year old son with moderate autism. what a god-send! he uses it every day, for several hours. i bought the speaker accessory so he doesn't have to use the head phones all the time. it is so easy to change the song list. he is able to use it independently, except for pushing the song vs. story button. the icons and ability to customize the icons have made it so he can quickly search for what he wants. i found the drawing screen for the icons challenging at first- but even me with my lack of artistic talent was able to accomplish the task so he knows them. i would give this my highest recommendation- very tough player- dropped who knows how many times- yet keeps going. the best thing i've purchased for him in a very long time. well worth the money.

It is an okay seat. My only complaint is that my son has slightly chubby legs and the area on the chair where his legs go and the whole "pummel" thing seem kind of tight and uncomfortable for him. We started him in it at about 4 months. He sits in it for only short periods of time, he gets uncomfortable pretty fast. Otherwise, a decent chair

I'll start off by saying that THIS is the company to buy Naruto headbands from. It is high quality fabric that is very comfortable on the skin and the length will fit around anyone's head (trust me, I have a pretty big head). The insignia plate is made out of real metal and is engraved superbly. A velcro padding on the back ensures that the plate doesn't touch your forehead and cause discomfort. In other words, this headband is like it was plucked out of the show itself, and for the price, it is a very nice addition to any Naruto fan's wardrobe

I got this for my 3 year old niece. She loves it and requests that it go with her all the time. The box to hold all the pieces is handy, the magnets are easy and there's lots of variations of outfits. Having 2 dolls makes it easy for friends, parents etc to play along and interact. The only cons I see is that the box with all the pieces is a bit heavy, it could use a handle. And the magnets are strong but sometimes the pieces slip a bit. All in all, a great gift and toy!

My 3 year old daughter has this dress up set and it is great for little hands that are not coordinated enough yet to dress and undress actual Barbi dolls.  She loves changing their outfits and switching their accessories - and I love that she can do this without any frustration.  Mellissa and Doug toys are made with the quality of older toys - they are well constructed and made to last - and the sturdy box allows for easy clean up and storage.

It is a little smaller than I expected...But I guess i shoulda wrote down the measurements and took a tape measure in the room before hand. Other than that, It's perfect. My son's room has an Atlanta Braves theme so the colors are perfect. The main reason I bought this was to use as a toy box. So far, it's worked out great! I don't have or plan to put books on top so the fact that the bookends are small don't bother me. The only thing I have sitting on top is a teddy bear and a piggy bank.

We recently purchased this toy storage unit for our 22 month old son and we couldn't be happier. It is sturdy and durable..a hard combination to find these days, looks great but most of all is very functional and user friendly!! It only requires 14 screws to assemble and it looks great. Our son can't wait to get up and play, yelling toy box and jumping out of bed to grab a bin.I will purchase more of these for the different "toy" areas of our home and would certainly give it as a gift

Wingo looks like the real car from the movie, drives great, it was a hit with both my boys ages 3 and 6.  The color on the car is bright and just like the one in the movie, the back of the car is exactly like the one in the movie.  My boys were very excited to see it!  They play and act out the whole cars movie with all their cars

I bought four of these for my husabnd, son in law, daughter and myself for Christmas. I wrapped a bag of marshmallows for each of them and gave them the wrapped guns and marshmallows on Christmas eve. The second they opened the marshmallows they knew what was in the box. They ripped into them and were shooting each other like crazy. They had a blast! I will tell you that the marshmallows do hurt at close range when the gun is pumped way up. My dogs loved it too. They ate all the marshmallows that fell to the floor. Well, not ALL of them..I did find some in the Christmas tree and on the bookshelves. (Yes they played with them in the house.) One trick...to get the marshmallows to shoot really well, we genlty rolled them in our hands from side to side to make the mallow just a bit skinnier. Stale marshmallows work great too

   Ms. Pac Man was always my game back in the day.  She just seemed less clunky than her male predecessor.

   I just received this game in the mail today and after a mad scramble for eight (count 'em EIGHT) AA batteries I got down to business.  I admit that I bought this game for Ms. Pac Man, exclusively.  Here's what I found, in a nutshell:

Pros:

1) Graphics & sound are faithful to the old arcade game with the minor exception of the placement of the score, lives and fruit.  No problem.

2) Old skool joystick.  Nice touch.

3) Plug 'n play set-up.  No brainer.

Cons:

1)  I honestly don't mind cords one bit.  The eight batteries can be a bit of a logistical problem as I don't usually have a dozen-or-so batteries lying around at any given time.

2)  My main gripe is that the joystick is frustratingly unresponsive and has the habit of moving Ms. Pac in directions I don't want her to go.  I understand, however, that the previous version of this game was worse in this regard and has been slightly improved in this version.  Fair 'nuff. 

   All-in-all a neat little contraption that is every bit as addictive as it was in my youth.

I bought this toy for my 3 year old son before his baby brother was to be born.  He absolutely loves this doll!  I babysit during the day and he took care of his baby right along with me while I cared for the baby I keep.  He had regressed and started wetting his pants again when I began babysitting but is now going to the bathroom on his own again after getting this doll and having his own baby to care for!  The yawn as some other reviewers have said does sound a bit weird but it IS only a doll!  If the baby is not attended to properly to make her stop fussing or to put her to sleep then she'll eventually just do it on her own so it's not frustrating for my son, great for younger kids.  My husband did not want our son having a "girl" doll and I can't find any clothes to fit the doll to turn it into a boy so my only wish is that this doll was also made as a boy or at least boy clothes were sold for her.

My 5-year-old adores this addition to his moonsand play set. The kit includes enough sand to make cars and other items to "run over" with the included Monster Truck. He had a ball and still plays with it at least once or so a week after a month of me purchasing it. The new inserted play mat for the original blow up moonsand kit makes it that more fun for him to play like he's at the Monster Trucks show! 

Great Idea! for a new and fun way to make and keep moonsand play sets interesting.

Yes, moonsand can get messy, but didn't we all learn creatively through making messes when we were younger? I'll gladly sweep this up when he's done

I purchased the 12-Prank Kit for my 83 year old aunt this past Christmas.  On Christmas Morning, as everyone opened the usual boring gifts of knit sweaters and scented candles, my elderly aunt carefully tore open her Prank Kit.  It was an instant hit!  As she laid out her Fake Dog Poop on the floor next to the Christmas tree and blew her new Fart Whistle, everyone started to roll with laughter.  Oddly enough, this inexpensive little gift became the high-point of our family Christmas gift-giving.  Maybe that sounds pathetic, but my Aunt was carried back to younger days when she used to pull pranks with whoopie cushions on her little nephews. Thanks to this great little package, we all laughed so hard it hurt.  What an awesome gift

Both of my kids got these for Christmas - great idea; not as expensive as a DVD player for the car (especially for those of us who don't want the portable one/plan to get next vehicle with built in) and the picture was really better than I thought it would be.

However, I only got my children two discs a piece to start.  Now, NO discs worthwhile can be found anywhere.  The only ones that are ever on the racks/online en masse are the Star Wars 3 pack (none of today's kids really want that), the Tony Hawk Skate Park (obviously they aren't interested there either) and Fear Factor (let's face it, if you let your kids watch FF you need to take the VideoNow player and hit yourself in the head - HARD).And even if I do find a couple on Ebay, the selection is so limited.  I wish I'd just bought a cheap portable DVD player.  Hasbro really missed the boat on this one - it could have been a great thing but they didn't make enough discs of the ones they do produce and need to put more shows out for the kids.  My advice: Don't buy it.  I am very disappointed in the disc selection - this is already at the bottom of the toy box.

This umbrella can be used with lots of other playsets, not just the Little Tikes brand. We use ours staked in the ground next to our Step 2 Naturally Playful sandbox/wading pool and we take it along and use it with his folding plastic chair that has an umbrella hole and clip. Great for hot days at the pool, beach or just hanging around in the backyard. It comes with a storage/ carry bag that has a carrying strap for over-the-shoulder hauling around, too. It has a wind vent at the top, but I would still close it at night or take it indoors if you have high winds, since it is a petite size and weighs less than similar full-size versions sold to adults. Nice forest green color and white pole and finial; the fabric is heavy-weight and overall the umbrella seems well-made. A great buy at this price

My son is 11 and loved this.  He was very proud when he built it by himself.  It is very detailed and has movable parts so that you can also play with it (gently of course).  This is the type of piece that is great all by itself without getting all the other pieces in the series.  It is also a classic piece in that it doesn't have a cartoon or charter theme

Every time I see my twin daughters riding these bikes around I make a promise to write a review of the product. Here I am fulfilling my promise. They were able to pedal the bike within 2 - 3 days of getting them. They are a great size for two year olds plus they fold up so that I can carry both in the back of my small car (89 chevy camaro) and are light enough that I can carry them by the big handle in the back when the girls want to run instead of bike. The only drawback is that they are a little unstable on tight turns.

My daughter (15 months) literally started running in place with excitement when she opened this baby doll, which was a gift from my best friend.  I've NEVER seen her react like this to any gift. My daughter has continued to bring this baby doll around with her everywhere--usually she just ditches her toys and plays with the tupperware. The doll has a soft, squishy body that makes her cuddley despite the fact that she has, as my husband is constantly saying, "a hard plastic head."

My son (5 year old) chose this toy as his reward and was so excited when he received it. He and his brother and dad enjoy countless hours of pretend play as they are all Star Wars fans.  It has a realistic appearance and the sound is not irritating as are many toy guns. Highly recommended

The X-23 figure availible on Amazon.com is dressed in purple but there also is a black one - a variant that is alot harder to find [I resorted to eBay for mine].  The build of the figure is great - There's so much articulation, it's insane; and her feet claws actually tuck under her shoes so they can be concealed which is beyond cool.  The articulation, for the most part, is great.  My only qualm with it is it makes her arms look funny but I can deal with that.  She's barely 6 inches tall, I don't expect her to be perfect.  However, the reason I'm giving her three stars is because I feel the purple outfitted one is far inferior to the black outfitted X.  I recieved my black clad X-23 first and expected the same figure but in a purple for my other one but I was wrong.  The black X-23 has very dark brown hair that lays straight and lank while the purple X-23's hair is jet black and windblown which makes her head almost impossible to move around.  Also, the thing that bothers me the most is that X's eyes are green on the black suited version but on the purple suited version, they're orange.  I am a big X-23 fan and I understand that when she's "triggered", her eyes go crazy reddish orange, but that's not something I really want to see sitting on top of my computer monitor.  It's kind of creepy!  And on a sidenote, when did X-23 wear purple?  In her comics she was either in black, dressed as a civilain or in the old Wolverine costume [which you can see in the comic that comes with X-23].  I would've prefered a variant wearing the Wolverine costume while the black X-23 was mass produced.  So, personally, I would recommend hunting down the variant of X-23 for your collection.  She looks nicer and, I think, is more true to the character

I bought this toy for my daughter almost a year ago now. She still plays with it all the time. It is by far her fav toy. The only problem is that it's a bit too load and no way to turn it down, or off. Well, besides that it is a perfect toy for small kids. My daughter is almost 4 and still is not tired of it

The is one of the fastest and easiest to learn games I have ever played.  The first time we played was on Christmas Day.  We had 10 players that ranged from 16 years to 77 years and everyone loved it.  We played for over 3 hours and decided we had to stop to eat.  It is also a great way to break the ice.  I would recommend this game to anyone whether you are a big game player or a beginner, this game can't be beat

Okay, we all know about the Disney CARS craze and trying to hunt down all the new die-cast characters Mattel puts out. These 1:24 scale models are very, very nice and the size is perfect for young boys, girls or collectors.  The only downside is that they only made Mater and McQueen. Who wouldn't love to see Chick Hicks or The King in 1:24 scale?! Come on Mattel! Get with it!!  ;

My son has really enjoyed this, however, after marks are made with the "washable" markers, it actually takes about 3 washings to get the marks out but they do come out eventually
