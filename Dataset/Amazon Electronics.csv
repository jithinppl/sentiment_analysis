We bought this for my daughter for her birthday in July.  She turned 13.  She played it 3 times with the new albums she got for her birthday.  She went to listen to some more new albums she bought and it didn't work.  The turntable would not turn!!!  I went to replace this item and I was literally 5 days from the last chance date that I had to return this item.  Not happy at all.  Now she is upset!!!,0.0

"Junk - will play MP3, but not WMA, even though the instructions it comes with says it will.  When you try to play WMA, you get &#34;FORMAT ERROR!&#34;.  My wife bought for a birthday present, by the time I opened it, I can no longer return it.  Instructions do not match player, menu, like everyone else said, is not intuitive.  To select something, you push &#34;Menu&#34;, when you would expect to push the button in the middle.  Aggravated with this player AND Amazon!",0.0
"I got these and used them a couple o times to swim. However, a few months after my purchase, I felt that one side was louder than the other. I turned them around and discovered that I'm not the one with a malfunction, but its this gadget somehow looses strength on one side. I bought these to replace my previous Sony Walkman, that suffered from the same malfunction. My conclusion is this: the Sony Walkman NWZW273S does NOT work!",0.0
did not support my xm radio it does not produce 12 v dc more like 8.5 v dc. they also have a no return policy go figure.,0.0
"Day 20 November 2014 acquired the JBL portable load Indoor / Outdoor Bluetooth Speaker | Black and hardly used it and 6.16.15 she has stopped working. Just take full charge when left more than 24 hours, yet their working time is no more than 2hs. The few times I used, was always loaded with accessories that accompanied it. I live in Brasilia-DF Brazil, not with the product warranty or aq even there in the USA. She when turned on, provides a noise as if in short circuit and after a while for the noise. only is working connected to the charger.<br /> It is expensive and that left me high and dry.<br /> Disappointed.",0.0
I was very dissapointed with the quality of the headphones they sound very low the battery dies in less then 2 hours which I find ironic because they are not even loud. The range from your phone to the actual headset is probably only like 2 feet because it disconnects everytime I got my phone in my pocket all around upset about the product especially for this price I could've bought any one of the 30 or 40 dollar headphone and it probably would've been the same or better,0.0
now they tell me you can't split optical audio,0.0
"Sorry, this cable worked for about a week then broke. I had ordered others before and same result. My fault for thinking things would change. Thought I had gotten a bad set, but that is the rule...not the exception. I'll try the more expensives ones from Bose.",0.0
"I ordered one, Loved it.  So I  gave the first one to my husband who was traveling for a month and ordered another for myself......wouldn't turn on after charging.  Returned for another one...same problem.  GRRRRRR!",0.0

"The turntable do not work correctly.  It was dragging!  Otherwise, the sound and other features worked well!!",0.0
"Bought Dec 6, 2014 and worked great until today... Now, the charger no longer charges and will not power the unit with the battery slide switch in OFF position. Checked the charger with a Volt Meter to be at 12.5 Vdc even with a 10 Ohm power resistor connected to it. Which means that the problem is in the Max A34. Not very easy to take apart as everything is glued with a soft glue gun. Now it is an expensive paper weight. Doubt 1 year warranty is worth anything, but will look into it. Cannot recommend this product based on this experience.",0.0
"I bought this 10 days ago. It was relatively easy to hook up. The auto-calibration took a few tries to get right, but I was pleased with the outcome. The sound was fantastic and really enhanced the viewing experience of my new Sony 4k 70&#34; television.<br /><br />Today it died. I was watching Band of Brothers, and halfway through episode 3 the sound just died. I did my own troubleshooting (I have an advanced degree in electrical engineering) and then called Sony support. They ran me through a few steps, and then escalated me to another department. After being on hold for 40 minutes, the line kicked off and said that the office I was trying to reach was closed for the day.<br /><br />So I am now 10 days into a three thousand dollar investment with Sony, and I am watching a football game with no sound while I type this.<br /><br />My receiver was a poor product. And the support line was awful.<br /><br />I am not happy.",0.0
Ordered to hookup a backup camera. This thing has different connectors on each end. I had one end hook up OK but had to find and RCA male to male adapter to make the other end right. I am not sure why they thought it was OK with differences from one end to the other.,0.0
"Comfortable, but terrible sound. Very tinny, with no bass at all.  I would return them and ask for my money back if I could.",0.0
"Trash, returned mine after 2 days. The pads are hard and very uncomfortable. It is completely plastic  and feels like it is  about to break. DONT BUY",0.0
"This had pretty good sound, but would not fit on my bike.  It requires you to have handlebars that are straight for at least the length of the speaker.  I didn't want to bend the cheap-looking clips too much, either.  However, the reason that I returned it was because it refused to charge out of the box.  Plugged in, it sounded rather nice, but that's kind of pointless for a bike speaker.",0.0
"I bought this as a replacement for my Verizon FIOS backup battery. The original battery lasted over three years... this one lasted 8 months. The &#34;Designed for long life: 6 - 8 years&#34; statement is a joke.<br /><br />I finally contacted the company after a week of trying (even after a year, their website listed on the battery is not working) and they offered me a replacement, however I had to ship the battery back to them first at my expense. To pay $20 to return a $23 battery for replacement is ridiculous, so their &#34;3-year replacement warranty&#34; is absolutely worthless.",0.0

"These headphones are a hit or miss. I've ordered 3 pairs - the first one lasted a while but inevitably broke after years of good service.<br /><br />So, I ordered a second pair. No bueno. It literally went bad on the 2nd listen!! I procrastinated calling the customer support number the headphones came with and eventually lost the little piece of paper, so I ended up buying a 3rd pair hoping the bad luck with the second was just a fluke.<br /><br />The 3rd pair lasted literally a week before - it too broke. Basically, only one of the headphones receives sound - regardless of what the headphones are plugged into. No matter if it's a computer, a phone or something else - only the headphone opposite of the mic works - which is quite inconvenient.<br /><br />To make matters worse - half the time the sound quality of the working headphone is horrendous. Overall, I really regret giving JLab another chance and buying from them. Their newer models just don't work.  Not sure what happened to the quality of their products, but it's crazy to have 2 different pairs of headphones stop working almost right away!<br /><br />Beware!",0.0
"died on me only after a year of use, ridiculous, and I used it very little...will be contacting sandisk and amazon to see if they will warranty but probably won't.....",0.0
"This boombox played one time, and then wouldn't work at all afterwards. We tried multiple CDs and they spin, but don't play.  Really disappointed the 4 and 6 year old kids who it was a gift for. Find another boombox if you want one that actually plays music.",0.0
Bought the Blue Ant Pump HD Sportbuds three months ago.  They won't turn on anymore.  Manufacturer's website fails to give any instructions on how to fix this problem.  Sound quality was average. Nothing spectacular.  They don't fit as snugly as others claim.  External noise interferes with the listening experience.  Wouldn't buy these again.  Don't waste your money on these.  Look for something more reliable.,0.0
The flat cord I used twice and it already quit working.  I have a cord that I paid about 10 bucks for at a gas station and it has lasted 5+ years and this thing doesn't last 2 hours...... oh and wait now I can't return it because its been 30 days.  Do yourself a favor and buy something else from someone else.,0.0

This does not work. Do not buy it. And they will not refund or accept returns. It ships from China. Total waste of money!,0.0
"1. The display is too bright, even on the lowest setting, for something you want in your bedroom at night.<br />2. The “snooze” button actually only engages the snooze mode. You have to dial in the minutes on a second knob and then hit a third button to execute. Other clock radios have a single button that you hit and forget.<br />3. The pre-select buttons are not lit, nor can you distinguish them by touch. Other clock radios have buttons and controls you can see or distinguish by touch in the dark.<br />In addition, my unit is finicky: (a) It gets lost trying to buffer the stations, all while my other mobile devices are having no problem getting wifi from the same location. (b) Either the power supply input jack or the start button fails. I fiddle with them and the device eventually turns on.<br />Finally, ten preset buttons is hardly enough.",0.0

"Not a good product. Looses network constantly. Audio out seems to have a mind of its own! With volume all the way down, will occasionly drive full volume of a screeching noise! Ruins speakers. I expected better for $1800. Also, no customer support available. No phone numbers and web based tech request has gone unanswered.",0.0
"The people who are reporting fit problems on the MCX male side aren't crazy. The product photo shows a series of tiny vertical relief cuts around the outer conductor of the MCX male connector that provides a kind of springiness that allows the male connector to flex slightly and then grab onto the internal components of the MCX female connector. Well, my pigtail was manufactured without those relief cuts. No amount of pressure will allow the male connector to be inserted in my NooElec RTL-SDR dongle, because there is no flex whatsoever. Needless to say, I am disappointed. Every photo of a MCX male plug that I've found online shows those relief cuts, so I assume they're part of the spec and this was just a massive screw-up by quality control. Maybe other people's MCX female ports have more flex to make up for it, but the plastic case of my RTL-SDR dongle won't even allow the rim of the male connector to pass. So now I'm stuck between drilling out the plastic case of the dongle and hoping for the best, or using some kind of tool to slice two vertical slits in the connector on the MCX male port.",0.0

"Terrible sound! This might satisfy a grade 3 student, as intended, but I even doubt that claim. The sound is like a child screeching, actually. Way too high in pitch, even with the &#34;tone&#34; adjustment. Classic cheap plastic Chinese workmanship to boot. Stay away. Has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with the vintage Califone's. Thank goodness I bought this locally in NYC from a reputable store that enabled me to promptly return it hassle free.",0.0

"Horrible design.  Difficult to install by yourself.  Screws that fit weren't long enough.  I've bought 4 different tv mounts, and this was by far the worst.  Difficult to attach and remove tv when necessary. Can't turn tv on an angle much because it's so close to the wall, maybe 15 degrees.  Spend the extra $10 for a better one.

"I bought a pair of these while on holiday in Las Vegas. After about three months the sound died in one earphone. When I contacted the company by e-mail, they basically, said, 'tough'. After sending model no. etc, their response was : 'I'm sorry to inform you that, we wont be able to ship back the unit to UK.We only ship the replacement units to USA or Canada.'<br />So bear it in mind if you buy these overseas and they stop working : you're on your own.<br />Sound quality wasn't that great but acceptable as long as you weren't anywhere busy. But basically, spend a little more and get better ones. With better after-sales service.",0.0
The headline for this item says it's stainless steel but but when you read the description is says it's zinc. I can confirm it is zinc casting and not nearly as nice as what is shown in the images. False advertising. I returned for refund.,0.0

"This item did not work at all. I spent a good deal of time researching personal cassette players on this site. I settled on this one for the &#34;bass boost.&#34; The packing looked original with one minor cut opening on a top corner. I installed brand new batteries only to find it did nothing. I tried different sets of new batteries just to make sure. Nothing worked. I'm highly disappointed. It was a plus that the item arrived earlier than the expected date. Too bad it doesn't work. I have requested a refund and return shipping. If they ship a working tape player, I will definitely share that too.",0.0

"I bought these from BestBuy a few weeks back, and I am incredibly disappointed with their shockingly poor quality.<br /><br />After using them regularly, I suddenly noticed that the left-channel was slightly softer than the right-channel. This situation continued until the audio in the right-channel unexpectedly decided one day to disappear entirely.<br /><br />I suspect that the wiring inside the earbud has broken, and this should tell you everything you need to know about its poor construction.<br /><br />Now, the left-channel is barely functioning and sounds muffled one minute and then fine the next. Again, I suspect the poor construction is the culprit.<br /><br />I could technically RMA them to Sony as it is within 30 days, but I don't see the point on wasting money on shipping that could go towards a better pair from a different manufacturer.<br /><br />Bottom line: Don't buy, or you'll regret it.",0.0
The amplifier made almost no difference in the reception.  I live 10-15 miles from the tower and most channels came in fine before using the amplifier.  I added the amplifier in hopes of improving the reception on the weak channels but it made almost no difference in how the weak channels performed.,0.0

"As far earbuds go, these are amazing, they sound espectacular, fit confortably in my ear, and best of all, will not fall when i am walking, jogging or running. So you may ask, why the poor rating, well, i've been using them for about two or three weeks, and last week the mic just stopped working, i tried running diagnostics on my phone  believing it could be the device, but everything turned out fine, then i try the same in my Relays and eventhoug my phone recognizes the michropone, the mic still did not work.<br /><br />so, it is a shame, the worst part is that  i was visiting the US, so, i can't just returned to get a new pair(which i would love) becuase of the shipping cost, and there are no SOL REPUBLIC stores in the country or any other kind of vendor, this just sucks",0.0

"Purchased this due to the high amazon reviews.  This is my third Onkyo receiver.

"I bought this product from Amazon last year, because I wanted to try the 24-bit A/D conversion. (I don't notice any difference between 16-bit and this.)  After very little use, the changer mechanism froze in the open position.  We found that the mechanism could be shut by depressing a pin inside the changer, but it would no longer play CDs.  I called Yamaha, and they told me I could send it to a service center in Bayshore, NY.  That is about 100 miles from my house. Tough luck, customer.  Yamaha does not pay for shipping in either direction.  So I spent close to $50 to send the product via UPS and back.  Yes, they fixed it, but I don't know for how long. The wise ass who called to say it was ready accused me of forcing the drawer shut.  Of course, I had to force the drawer shut, otherwise, there was no way to send it for repair.<br /><br />I am not happy about the difficulty obtaining warranty service.<br /><br />I find the pause feature to be unsatisfactory.  If I leave it on pause for longer than a few minutes (I am not exactly sure for how long), pressing the button again will start the CD from the beginning, instead of where it was when I pressed pause.<br /><br />Next time I will avoid Yamaha.",0.0

"I bought this clock based on the reviews for it and the product description. What I received was quite disappointing. There are several things to be cautious of about this clock that the product description doesn't make clear. Here they are:<br /><br />a.) The clock is only chargeable by micro-usb cable (and they supply a cable, but you need to supply the actual plug). It is meant to run on an internal battery, which holds a decent charge, but is still less than reliable, and certainly not as reliable as keeping a clock plugged in. Each recharge takes about 6 hours.<br /><br />b.) If you turn the clock off or run out of battery, you must reprogram everything. You lose your calendar (year and month) and your time. YOu'll need to do this every time you recharge or turn off the clock.<br /><br />c.) If there is a way to get a 12 hour (rather than a 24 hour) time, I haven't found it, and the directions don't tell. I prefer 12 hour to 24 hour, so this clock is usable, but...<br /><br />d.) The clock is VERY small. I don't have exact measurements, but my 6-inch-screen cell phone is longer than the width of this clock (not just the clock face, but the entire width of the clock.)<br /><br />So, there you have it. This a a good clock, maybe, if you need a clock for traveling with. But I wouldn't and won't be using it as my bedroom alarm clock.",0.0

Tried treble boost on my Iphone 6 plus, still terrible. Tried bass reducer and Rock, still terrible. I listened to a podcast of First Take and Lil Wayne was on it. I couldn't understand what he was saying because his voice is so deep and monotone that it was basically distorted. I listened to rock and hip hop and I still hate, hate, hate these earbuds. I don't know how they had 48 reviews at the time I bought it and all were 4 to 5 stars. You have to be kidding me. And these earbuds are not broken. They just are awful sounding. I've been buying Skullcandy with the built in mic because they are cheap and sound great especially at high volumes, but as I said, they're cheap and the mic stops working after about a month and a half because I use them so much. So I figured let me try and find a better quality earbud so I don't have to keep buying new ones. Well these are very well made, as far as feel. I have used them long enough to know if they break but I'll just keep buying my old earbuds and just keep these as a backup till a new pair comes when an old pair goes.

"I really wanted to like this receiver, and when I first got it I did. The interface using the TV is great, the setup is painless, and there's tons of options. However, I've already had two units fail, the first would go into protection mode as soon as the volume went above 15, the second one just had the HDMI output jack fail for no apparent reason after a month and a half of infrequent use. I really like Sony products in general, but the two lemons I've had on this model has tarnished my opinion.<br /><br />Now I have to try to get warranty repair work done because the unit failed outside the return policy for Amazon, which is frustrating to say the least on a unit that isn't even 2 months old yet.",0.0

At the same time, my own sounds (movement, breathing, rubbing of the t-shirt on the neckband) got amplified and made listening to music very unpleasant.

I purchased one of  these in 2014 but did not try to use it until 8/2015. First indication the LED light did not come on and there was no output.

I located the internal power supply and found it to be putting out 11.7 volts but I do not know if this is correct not having a schematic and not being able to determine what the IC's were. There were only two IC's and two transistors so even if this thing worked it would probably drift all over the place. Total piece of junk. Do not purchase.,0.0

There is a specific power cycle pattern to be followed in order to get the AV receiver set up screen on to the TV.I am able to connect a Laptop to the HDMI of the TV and it works. I think Yamaha and Sony has to work together to resolve this issue other wise they may loose their customers.I am seeing some of the forums already started discussing this issues.

"I purchased this antenna without realizing it was an &#34;amplified&#34; antenna until after the purchase. If I had noticed it at first, I wouldn't have ordered it.<br /><br />Here's why:<br /><br />Amplifiers on TV antennas don't significantly improve the capability for you to view a TV channel. Sure, you will probably see a stronger &#34;Signal Strength&#34; for all your channels. Maybe you will even see more channels listed (I didn't). But, the important thing is being able to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) - which boosts your TV signal without raising the background noise level at the same time. I haven't found an inexpensive TV antenna amplifier yet that does this. All the TV antenna amplifiers I have used (including this one) have all boosted the noise and the signal at the same time, and the amplified channels are still as unwatchable as when they are unamplified.<br /><br />Think about it this way: If this simple amplification would improve the TV reception for all channels, why don't they put this amplification in all HDTVs? (Note: There is some signal amplification and heavy signal processing done in all HDTVs to extract the TV signal, but the real work is done by the signal processing)<br /><br />Here's a good example: I live 25 miles from the transmitting towers for my metro area. Even with using the amplification, I only picked up 34 channels with the 1byone. My recommended antenna (below) gets 45 channels unamplified. Both antennas were pointed in the same direction by using my compass.<br /><br />In summary: This &#34;60 Mile Antenna&#34; amplified 1byone antenna is a cheaper antenna attached to an amplifier to compensate, and certainly isn't usable as a realistic 60 mile antenna.<br /><br />Now, to the antennas I DO recommend, sold by Amazon. These directional, unamplified antennas by Antennas Direct did a much better job for me:<br /><br />http://amzn.com/B0017O3UHI (UHF Only)<br />http://amzn.com/B007RH5GZI (VHF + UHF)<br /><br />You will want to check in your area to see if you have VHF HD channel broadcasts. While most HDTV channels are broadcast via UHF frequencies, some are broadcast over VHF frequencies. In my metro area, there are two major broadcasters that use VHF. That will determine which of the two antennas above you should consider buying.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Antennas Direct antennas are a bit more expensive, but this is a one-time purchase, so I'm OK with that.want to check in your area to see if you have VHF HD channel broadcasts.

"Let me preface this deservedly negative product review by saying that I’m generally skeptical of negative product reviews. My admittedly snooty impression when reading them is usually something along the lines of: “Well, this person’s clearly an idiot and just doesn’t know what they’re doing.” Congrats to Personus for making me the idiot in this case.<br /><br />If I had to guess, these were speakers conceived of by a marketing group and then rushed through development without giving much thought to technical design and testing. As you can glean from the numerous negative reviews on Amazon (and elsewhere), these speakers do have serious deficiencies that, to make matters worse, Presonus seems to be handling by inventing plausible deniability for themselves instead of actually attempting to address the issues (more on that below). Trust me when I say my criticisms are not just a matter of having “sour grape” syndrome. These things really do have problems.<br /><br />Presonus’ primary marketing claims for these speakers are: 1) that they offer Bluetooth connectivity; and 2) that the sound quality is good (not “audiophile” good, just run-of-the-mill good, which you would think should be relatively achievable). In my opinion, they fall short on both claims. To wit...<br /><br />1) Bluetooth connectivity – If you’re reading this review, you’ve probably noticed that the majority of other negative reviews comment on “static” and/or “hiss” coming from the speakers when attempting to play music via Bluetooth connection. Prior to giving these speakers a shot, I figured these reviews were flukes, i.e., either said reviewer had the rare defective speaker or the problem could be attributed to user error. My suspicion about these speakers was raised a little bit when I read one reviewer commenting that he discovered the static sound (identical to the sound accompanying “snow” on a TV) was caused by the powered speaker (i.e., the left one) being plugged into an ungrounded, two-wire outlet. “That seems plausible,” I thought, but I decided to give them a try anyway. Unfortunately, after having tried these speakers in both grounded and ungrounded outlets, I can now verify that this is exactly the case. Simply put: if you intend to plug these speakers into an outlet that is ungrounded (i.e., having no third hole for a ground circuit), playback of music will be overlain by severe static, so much so that you probably won’t hear any identifiable musical sounds coming from the speakers. Because I had a non-Presonus subwoofer connected to the speakers when I tested this, I can confirm that you will still be able to connect to the speakers via Bluetooth (I heard rhythmic bass coming from the subwoofer, which suggests that the music signal was streaming), but you simply won’t be able to hear much, if anything, other than static (and a little bass if using a subwoofer). As long as the place where you intend to use these speakers has grounded outlets, the Bluetooth connection should work without producing static (at least in my case it did), but if your home was built prior to about 1965 and has not had a wiring upgrade, these won’t work for you if you intend to use them with Bluetooth (which is the main selling point of these speakers).<br /><br />Presonus makes matters worse (for its own reputation, I think) when on its website it attempts to sweep this problem under the rug by attributing the “static” problem to mere user error. Specifically, if you read the “troubleshooting” section for the Ceres line, Presonus talks its way around the issue by arguing that static and hiss may be the result of poor audio source quality (e.g., crummy MP3 files, a laptop with cheap audio adapters, etc.). Now, while it’s certainly possible to get his and static from a lackluster audio source, that’s not the source of the problem being widely reported in these reviews – it’s the problem associated with plugging them into ungrounded outlets. Surely Presonus knows this, which makes their irrelevant response to the problem look like little more than an attempt to generate plausible deniability. They would have been just as well off if they had simply stated: “It’s not us; it’s you.”<br /><br />Another note on the Bluetooth connection: I was able to connect with Bluetooth-capable IOS devices (iPhone 5, iPad, etc.), but not with the Bluetooth connection on a Windows 7 laptop. The laptop was able to detect the Ceres speakers, but it wouldn’t stream music due to what was reported as a missing device driver. This could be blamed on Windows (and I’m sure that would be Presonus’ answer), but you would think that a company would go out of its way to make sure its devices worked with the peripherals it claims are supported. Reading Presonus’ technical support for Windows 7 also deserves criticism, as it was nothing more than a cut-and-paste job from what appears to be the troubleshooting steps for a different version of Windows (e.g., Vista, XP, etc.), as the steps in this case didn’t actually match up with the menu configuration for Windows 7. That’s just lazy technical writing. I have no experience calling Presonus’ technical help number (I repackaged and returned these tout suite), but based on the universal criticism it receives, I’m guessing the same people running the tech help line are also writing the tech help documentation.<br /><br />2) Sound quality – These aren’t marketed as “audiophile” speakers, so there’s not much to criticize in terms of sound quality given that Presonus has already set such a low bar for itself. That said, the performance of these speakers was shockingly laughable. I mean, I was irritated at first, but then that sense of irritation was replaced by a kind of existential, “all of life is folly” laughter. The problem? These things are underwhelmingly loud. Disappointingly quiet, you could say. That $20 pair of USB-powered Logitech speakers you saw at Walmart? Yeah, those are louder than these. Again, Presonus claims that one needs to first tweak the volume on the audio source (e.g., iPhone, laptop, etc.) to find the best volume setting on the speakers, but even at its best, the Ceres can only be turned up to about 70 percent its maximum volume range before the speakers begin to clip and the sound breaks up into distortion. Using a decibel meter at a distance of 10 feet, I could only get about 75 decibels at the maximum volume setting before clipping. For reference, that’s about how loud a dishwasher is. Given this limitation, I think these speakers would be perfect for either streaming Raffi music in the nap room of a daycare or playing wildlife sounds in a cat sanctuary. If that’s your thing, these speakers are for you (provided, of course, the problems with the Bluetooth connection described above don't already present an impediment).<br /><br />Some other annoyances... The subwoofer out connection is a 1/4” TRS jack, whereas most consumer-grade subwoofers are equipped with RCA-style connections. That means you’ll probably need an adapter to run an existing subwoofer from these speakers. Presonus includes a 1/4&#34;-to-RCA adapter as an accessory, but for some reason it’s a 1/4&#34; mono adapter, not a TRS (i.e., stereo) adapter, which sort of defeats the purpose of having a TRS-equipped subwoofer out. Again, poor planning on Presonus’ part.<br /><br />While Bluetooth-equipped speakers are clearly more than a gimmick (as evidenced by the numerous other BT-equipped audio products on the market), Presonus’ execution with the Ceres makes at least their version of it look pretty gimmicky. I guess my first clue to this should have been the fact that their product video for the Ceres line doesn’t actually give any useful information about the speakers, themselves, but instead shows a group of what I’m assuming are trust-funded, twenty-something hipsters playing horribly clich&eacute;d music and slicing up a cucumber (seriously). In short, you can, and should, do far better for the money.USB-powered Logitech speakers you saw at Walmart? Yeah, those are louder than these.

Very disappointed with this product.  I have purchased two of them because they are compact and sound GREAT when they work. Both have failed prematurely and with little use.  Both failed in the same manner.  First there was distortion using Bluetooth and then I resorted to using the aux jack in the rear.  Then one day you turn it on and there is major sound distortion at any volume level.  I have tried charging and discharging the battery and anything else I could think of.  I tried comnecting to it with multiple different devices via blue tooth and multiple different cords that were known good.  The distortion was not caused by blowing the speakers either.  Over time it seems as if the internal amp has a failure.  Neither unit was even used near the water or a damp environment.  It was used outside while working on small projects.  The battery life was great and I talked many of my friends and family into purchasing the same unit (now with regret).  You will love it and then hate it.

"Ordered this Bose System in May.  It is now almost September and it stopped working.  I had an earlier version of this system and it was much better.  The earlier system worked whether plugged in or not, this one has to be plugged in.  Also, the volume control is no longer on the system and only on a remote, unlike the earlier model.  Good thing I kept the box and paperwork, I'll have to deal with Bose since Amazon's return policy is 30 days.",0.0

"I was foolishly surprised at the size of this thing. I just assumed that it would be a reasonable size, certainly no bigger than my Teac 501 or Mytek Stereo DSD, both of which also have balanced outputs and also play DSD. I was floored when the box arrived. At 19&#34; wide and 22&#34; deep, it won't fit on any of my media shelves or equipment racks. Still, had it performed well, I probably would have kept it. I wasn't expecting sound on the same level as my Teac or Mytek, but I did think that it should be on a par with my $200 ifi-Nano which also plays DSD and is only the size of a pack of cigarettes. Boy was I wrong. Regardless of resolution, the XDA-2 obscures detail rendering music lifeless. Instruments are blurred together, and voices are hard to distinguish. In addition, it certainly doesn't meet its SNR specs in either the preamp or head phone amp mode. I couldn't believe that I heard noise through my Sennheiser 600s, even at very modest volume levels. That's a first for me with any DAC I've tried. Then I cranked up the volume driving my new Parasound A23 amp in balanced mode with quality interconnects and guess what? More noise. Believe me, when I run the Teac, Mytek, or ifi DACs through the Parasound at full volume there's total silence. The final clincher was the issue with the Windows 10 driver. My anti-virus software wouldn't let me download it, so I had to disable my virus protection in order to get the driver form Emotiva. This driver would not recognize the XDA-2 on all of my Windows 10 computers, although I was able to find a C Media driver that would. Still, there is a serious issue with either the C Media- or Emotiva-supplied driver in Windows 10 - when the XDA-2 is turned off and on or disconnected while the computer is running, you have to reboot the computer in order to use the XDA-2 at any resolution other that 16-bit 44 or 48k!!!  For me, this is a major inconvenience. After two frustrating days of trying to get the software issue resolved,  Ipacked it up and got a return authorization from Amazon. Thank you again Amazon for your amazing customer support.",0.0

At that point, if I unplug and reconnect the HDMI cable, it starts working again for a short while but then continues to go in and out sporadically.

"First, let me start off with my equipment. i have Polk RTI A7s and CSI A6 and PSW111 sub (and 2x RTI A3's on the way). The sound is fantastic; could not be happier with the performance. Been listening to radio and watching TV with it so far. Yesterday, my Blu Ray player arrived and we scheduled our first &#34;Movie Night&#34; as a family. Unfortunately, the screen and sound cut out/ went black and the screen read &#34;not supported&#34; or &#34;HDMI1 not found&#34;. It then corrected itself until it happened a couple more times. I tried a different HDMI cable, same issue occurred. Tried a different HDMI input and had same issue. I then connected it to the HDMI input that my cable TV was connected to and everything worked fine; no issues. I then connected my cable box to the BD input and then HDMI3 input and experienced the same black screen issue on both of those. So i've confirmed there is an issue with at least 2 of the HDMI inputs on this unit. As of this writing, i am awaiting a replacement device. I will post an update upon receiving the replacement unit. UPDATE 9/3/15: While awaiting my RMA, which i received within 2 days, i read some reviews about performing a firmware update. I updated my firmware from 1.4 to 1.5.  Since performing the update (which took ~30 minutes to complete via USB), the issue has not resurfaced. I am cautiously optimistic. Increasing this review to 3 stars and will update again in a few more days after i have some time to perform additional testing... UPDATE 9/5/2015: Could not make it through the first night of testing, post-firmware update. Watching Optimum worked fine. No video cutting out issue. Had the neighbors' kids over to watch a movie. Nothing i did would get a picture from the DVD player. Ran a firmware update on that as well, no dice. Bypassed the receiver and went straight to the projector- worked fine (without sound, of course). Connected the same DVD player to 2 other TVs - no problem. At this point, i've lost all patience with this device. lowering to 1 star- when it works, it sounds fantastic. Shame it doesnt work properly. i originally asked for a replacement, but now i will simply return this device and look for a different brand. UPDATE 9/9/2015: Picked up a different receiver (Pioneer Elite VSX90) this weekend. Everything works great, no issues. I will say- the Yamaha sounded better IMO, though i havent pushed the Pioneer yet. Happy with my new purchase.",0.0

Suckysucksuck<br />I had my eye on this for many months and finally pulled the trigger and purchased this to replace my Squeezebox Duet that I could not get to work with my Spotify premium account.

The people at Sonos must be sitting on their hands all day with their thumbs up their….. uh…….well…nose. It’s a shame as this otherwise well thought out product will be returned tomorrow. Sucks for them I guess. If you are thinking of using this with Spotify you should think again and save some time and aggravation.,0.0

"I took a chance and made the mistake of purchasing 3 of these because I got a better deal on shipping.  I thought that perhaps all the bad reviews were simply from people who did not install this properly, or were located in remote areas.  Having installed this on two different outdoor antennas in two different states, attempting various combinations of installation, I got to see how they operated (DID NOT OPERATE).  With one location in an urban area 15 miles from local towers and secondary station towers located 60 miles away, and another rural location 50+miles away from the nearest towers, I have come to the conclusion that these are pure junk.  In each situation, closest stations became weaker or disappeared, while absolutely no benefit to ever solidifying signals from any distant or close stations.  Since I bought and tried 3 of these, I am convinced now that the positive reviews must have been from people hooking up their TV and antennas for the first time, or in the process of hooking this device up they tightened a cable that may have been loose, or some tested this out on a day that happened to be great reception.  In each situation that I tried these over the last few years (with different installation variations in case I was missing something), these devices significantly hindered reception.  My advice is to do yourself a favor, and don't buy these like I did, and if you did buy these, take them down and return them or dispose of them, and you will enjoy better reception without them.",0.0

After initial setup.all seamed good. STB to AV Receiver to TV. Started loosing video intermittently. TV saying loosing STB connection. Check cables or turn on. Chased for a while and troubleshot to the reciever. Eventually progressed to complete loss of #1 HDMI port. Denon offered work around by using another port. They said to send in for warranty work if I wanted the port back.The port names are defaulted and cannot be changed. Therefore the reciever display would never accurately display the correct source.  I talk to the service center and find out that they test with another device such as a Bluray player. I do this and it works. He says nthat he cannot do anything with it and that Dennon has an issue.This reciever has issues maintaining passthrough with some Set Top Boxes via HDMI. This is a HDCP issue. Using it now only for audio. Unusable for an AV Switch with my Set Top Box.,0.0
"Bad design for mounting speakers. The only way to mount these is to screw the bracket to the wall with the mount disassembled, and then reassemble the mount with the speaker already screwed to the front part of the mount. I was mounting these near the ceiling, in this configuration there is no good way to tighten the ball part of the mount... so the speaker will not stay in place. The other problem is that the screw into the speaker that hold it to the mount doesn't really hold very tight.<br /><br />Note: Forced 1 star rating... would have given no stars.",0.0

After a couple of times using it though, it began to stop during play and would not reconnect thru Bluetooth. Then the last time I tried to use it, a few days ago, it made a beeping sound and quit completely.  I thought maybe it needed to be recharged, but that didn't help. It seems to have no power now at all.  There is a small blue light that displays when it is turned on and that light does not come on now either.

"I bought these to replace my dead—and recently discontinued—Sony MDRE828LP ear buds, thinking they would be a close match, and perhaps even an evolution of the old design. (The MDRE828LP had insanely good bass for the size and clear, crisp treble and midrange sound. And at the time, they were only $5.) The shape of my ears makes high-end, rubbery, noise-canceling ear buds a no-go; I much prefer these type of ear buds.<br /><br />I was sadly very mistaken. These are horrible. Mushy, muffled sound, like having cotton in your ears. No bass. Tinny. Not to mention the shape, which is uncomfortable and chunky. Unlike the old ones, these are cheap crap quality to go with the cheap price. For music, the sound is honestly unbearable. I ended up giving these away to Goodwill immediately.",0.0

"Unfortunately this seemed to torpedo a previously reliable system for me.  I have a cabinet that contains a Time Warner set top box and an Onkyo TX-NR838 receiver, and I had been operating the system with the cabinet doors open without problems.  I wanted them closed, so I ordered the repeater.  When I first installed it, everything seemed to work.  Less than one week later, the set top box would not operate when the cabinet door was closed or open.  If I turned off the repeater, it worked flawlessly with the remote.  I tried changing the transmitter module connected to the set top box (the unit included more transmitters than I needed), and it appeared to fix the problem for a short time, but within a day, again the Time Warner remote would not control the set top box using the repeater.  When I unplugged the repeater, the set top box would again work with the remote.  The Onkyo receiver seemed to work with the repeater most of the time, but there were &#34;exotic&#34; problems with it that started happening when I installed the IR Repeater.  I cannot be certain that the IR Repeater was the problem,because I am not willing to put any further effort into making it work to isolate the specific problems.  I chose to take it out, throw it away, and keep the cabinet doors open.  After I did that (took it out and again kept the doors open and used the remote to directly control the devices), everything in my system works flawlessly.  The poor rating is for my particular application, which did not work.",0.0

"These wipes are terrible. They leave behind a bunch of lint, which is most unhelpful when you're trying to clean up your phone before applying a screen/back protector. I would only recommend using them if you have some real grime build up to remove from your computer/phone/tv screen, something that calls for a little dampness to get off. You'll definitely want to follow up with a microfiber cleaning cloth after using these, to remove all that darn lint the wipes left behind on your device. I think they do dry alright, didn't have much streaking left on the back of my Edge+ phone, but the lint is a real headache and deal killer for me. Also, the dispenser is poorly designed. It's way too big of an opening, and you have to manually tear off a wipe (then push the other dozen that came up with that wipe back down into the canister). I purchased my can of these at Meijer for $4.99, surprisingly a bit cheaper than the Amazon price. For 5 bucks, 70 wipes seems like a good deal, but these in the end, are not worth the purchase. I recommend using a high alcohol, such as 91%, rubbing alcohol with microfiber towels for cleaning electronic devices. Cheaper, cleaner, and far more effective than these wipes.",0.0

The buttons stopped working as intended, as did the mic.  Most recently audio from the left ear stopped working.<br /><br />$150 Headphones, less than 1 year later, stopped working almost altogether.<br /><br />After contacting the Bose Customer Service Line, and walking to the store directly, I was given the same speech.  The product is out of warranty despite it continuing to be sold in store through last year, and that I could exchange for an upgraded set at $75 + Shipping and Handling ($85 in person at the Lahaska Store, either he mis-spoke and meant to say $75 or they really charge more at a store-front)<br /><br />Headphones at this price point should not break in less than a year, period.  Even if they were bought earlier, at that price point would reasonably expect a longer shelf life.

"I feel bad rating this a one star because the features on paper are all there. I had high hopes on the comeback of RCA Company via Audiovox's 808 branding to appeal to the young generation.<br /><br />However it turns out that it's more of a gimmick.<br /><br />WHAT I DID NOT LIKE:<br /><br />- The rotating earcups do nothing really that a well built flexible headphone band can do. In fact it's more cumbersome to rotate than to simply remove from your ear and reposition just like you normally would. It ended up a bit annoying.<br /><br />- The ear cups provide mediocre fit to my average sized ears. It's too round and not big enough. Needs to be more oblong in shape for a better fit and sound isolation.<br /><br />- The silicone padding is unique which I welcome and say kudos on this innovative application but it's too thin that I can feel the metal headband pressing down. Needs to be thicker for more padding.<br /><br />- The sound is horrible. It just was muffled from the highs to the mids that the low end becomes prominent. It's like someone took an equalizer and dialled down the highs and dialled up the bass.<br /><br />- Flimsy cord with fat ends that wouldn't fit my iPhone with a case. I like that it uses generic connectors and has a non-tangling feature, but my more expensive headphones uses fatter cables but has a thinner end connector so it fits even with a case.<br /><br />WHAT I LIKED:<br /><br />- The floating speaker concept is an interesting application that I feel deserves better. It provides better isolation from the headband. Too bad the actual speaker doesn't deliver to back up the design.<br /><br />- The metal headband I really love. It's minimalistic and authoritative at the same time that the height adjustment clicks with finesse.<br /><br />- The silicone padding is a great first I've seen and is so easy to clean and replace. But it's too thin my head hurt from the headband pressure.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br /><br />For the listed price the fit and finish is actually very good. I wanted to love this headphone and use as an everyday gear but the moment I put it on my ear and started a familiar music that I listen through studio quality monitoring headphones as well as studio monitor speakers that are of different brands but sound very similar, this 808 just played a different tune altogether. It's so bad it stood out.<br /><br />And in the end no matter the material and build quality. You buy it for the sound quality and I sadly can't recommend it even at this price.nd finish is actually very good.

"I initially purchased these AA batteries for emergency LED lanterns. Well I had some previously purchased lanterns that I loved.....stayed on for 48 continuous hours with Eneloop batteries. I wanted to buy a few more for my parents in case of a power outage, so I found the LED lanterns still available here on Amazon and bought four more.  This time around though I opted for these EBL batteries to save some dough$$$.<br /><br />The lanterns and batteries arrived and of course I proceeded to check each lantern, after all they (Lanterns) come on a LOOOOONG boat ride from CHINA in a padded envelope.  Well, test one.....fail to light.......test another..... fail to light........test last one and get a flash when shaking it( we all know that when something will not work the logical thing to do is shake it, tap it, rap it on the counter or if all else fails....hit it with a hammer)  all jokes aside, I being mechanically inclined (we are talking about installing batteries here folks...I got  this!!!) had to figure out why.<br /><br />I looked and analyzed the battery compartment of the Lanterns.....all seemed well.  upon closer examination I noticed that the metal positive contacts were not dimpled far enough out to contact the positive nub on the EBL battery,  OR SO I THOUGHT!!!! I tried an eneloop, an Energizer and a Duracell all functioned flawlessly.  So, what gives????<br /><br />I took out my digital calipers and compared EBL to the Eneloops. (SAMPLE OF 6 Each and then averaged them out.<br /><br />Overall length  of Eneloop.....1.975&#34;<br />Overall length of EBL.............1.969&#34;<br />Overall height of positive nub off the top of the cell  Eneloop.......  .064&#34;<br />Overall height of positive nub off the top of the cell  EBL.............  .038&#34;<br />Overall diameter of cell Eneloop.......  .555&#34;<br />Overall diameter of cell EBL..............  .564&#34;<br /><br />Problem solved.... the positive nub protruding from the top of the battery is so GROSSLY out of spec, that it will not make contact the with any devices' terminals I tried these in. Way too short.  Also as other reviewers mentioned they will be snug fitting or not fit at all in some devices due to the fact that  they are larger in diameter than other batteries as well, so if you have a device that requires 4 -6-8 of these grouped together in the battery compartment the problem multiplies exponentially.<br /><br />Maybe I got a bad batch? They should not have passed quality control.<br /><br />Amazon was very helpful and sent out prepaid return label, but BEWARE, it may not be a dead battery as so many others wrote in their reviews but a lack of contact with the devices terminals due to the positive nub being so short along with overall length being shorter as well.<br /><br />I have to say that the seller, AIBOCN, contacted me immediately after seeing my request for a return and offered a full refund all expenses paid return but Amazon did the refund anyway as I contacted them first.  The seller also stated that they were going to contact the manufacturer as well to make them aware of the short battery and terminal lenght.  Cant complain about their customer service a bit.

"These earbuds became one of the most disappointing purchases that I have ever made here on Amazon. When I received them I was under the impression that I would receive some level of quality that comes with a 20 dollar purchase, but when I was testing them out, they simply sounded muffled, grainy and otherwise poor. My previous earbud purchase of the SoSoon earbuds for about 10 dollars are vastly superior, with a nice carrying case, extra end bits and much more. The SoSoons sound much better than these and I would recommend them for a quick purchase. These would only be a decent pair for a price of maybe 5 dollars, but there are many other places to find better earbuds.",0.0

To make matters worse, there was a sticker applied to the package with the U.S model number covering the model number that indicated I had the Australian model. I returned the remote to Amazon. The next day I went to Best Buy, verified theirs was the U.S. model, paid $3.00 more, went home plugged it in and it immediately recognized the serial number. The setup was a breeze and the remote works great. The fact that the Australian model had a sticker with the U.S. model number on it covering up the fact it was an Australian model was quite disconcerting.",0.0

Made a big mistake getting this again here is why. I placed it in same spot in attic. No matter how hard I tried to get it to connect and amplify, it would not. I could obtain channel 4 & 7 with no power to it, but single was shaky. I could not get CBS. After frustrating myself for about 3 weeks, I noticed my 30 days had expired by one day. I selected a much cheaper antenna and put it in the attic. My signal strength went from 30 to 73, and I started getting all my missing stations. The Lava antenna must be bad.

"The receiver shuts down and has to be re-booted even under moderate volume when running five NHT VS1.4 8 ohm impedance speakers and an M&K MX-350THX powered subwoofer.  The NHT speakers ran fine when powered by three Rotel RB981 130 Watt/channel stereo amps controlled by an Acurus ACT3 5.1 surround sound preamp.  The subwoofer also ran fine when connected to the Acurus ACT3.  The Yamaha receiver was purchased to replace and update that system.<br /><br />After talking with Yamaha, they suggested that the new receiver was defective -- since testing with the receiver's automatic speaker optimization did not indicate any shorts or polarity problems in the speaker installation, and that I try a replacement.<br /><br />Unfortunately the replacement shuts down and has to be re-booted even under moderate volume, even after implementing the receiver’s automatic speaker optimization and associated testing that came with the receiver - no polarity problem with the speakers, but all speakers except the subwoofer showing volume deviations of &#62;+10dB and the subwoofer deviating at -10db (a W-3 problem).<br /><br />I suspect that the problem may be because its software for automatically optimizing the speaker settings does not work for systems that have a self-powered subwoofer attached to the pre-amp lead for powered subwoofers and all other speakers attached to the receiver's speaker leads- as the instructions for the receiver specify<br /><br />It took an hour on hold to get through to Yamaha tech support again about this; and the person I reached, after an hour testing different settings, could not solve the problem of the system shutting down under moderate volume under most settings.  He elevated it to his supervisor with my request for level 2 tech support and said that Yamaha would get back to me in two days. Two days are up and I have not heard back from Yamaha.<br /><br />Later, after installing the wireless connection on the new receiver, the receiver then gave me a message that new firmware software was available. I downloaded installed the new Yamaha firmware and still had the same problem with it shutting down at moderate volumes.<br /><br />I did a long series of automated sound setup optimization runs and found speaker polarity issues reported -- along with the previously mentioned volume issues. What was really disturbing is that the speakers with polarity problems were reported to change almost every time I reversed the polarity on the speaker or speakers for which the speaker setup software detected an apparent polarity problem. After such adjustments, I usually got a different combination of speakers with polarity problems, but sometimes it showed the same problem on the same speaker despite reversing the polarity on the leads to that same speaker with an alleged polarity problem.<br /><br />Speaker connections reported to have polarity problems on different runs of the same speaker optimization software included<br />o  Left front and right and left surround speakers<br />o  Left front and left surround speaker<br />o  Left surround speaker only<br />o  Right surround speaker only...<br />o  Right and left surround speakers only<br />o  etc<br />Every surround sound speaker (except the center speaker and rarely the front right speaker) sometimes showed  a polarity problem on one or more runs . Concerning volume, the automatic speaker optimization for volume continued to show all speakers other than the powered subwoofer showing deviations of &#62;+10dB and the powered subwoofer deviating at -10db, confirming that the software installed on the receiver can’t deal with a powered subwoofer; and the upgraded firmware now shows inconsistent and erratic results concerning speaker polarity as well as the previously reported volume issue.<br /><br />If I do not hear back from their level 2 technical support and get the problem solved (or solve the problem myself by manually adjusting the speaker settings) soon, I will return the system for a refund and consider alternative systems for properly driving my speakers.",0.0

"Update as of 10/25/2015. Changing my rating from 3 to one star because the power switch problem as outlined below has now changed to where I can no longer use the Bluetooth feature at all. I can now only use it on AUX with a cord, which totally defeats the reason that I purchased this overpriced unit in the first place. Very disappointed!   Worked great for about a year plus a few months. But now I am having a problem where every time that I try to use it through Bluetooth, it comes on and syncs, and then starts acting like the battery is low, even though it is fully charged. I found that if I flip the power switch off, then back on again, and resync, it will work until I have to turn it back off again. It does this every time now, and even proactively flipping the switch on/off before syncing, will not work. I have to do the tedious procedure above. I would have given this 4 1/2 stars if not for this flaw, and it would have been nice if the USB could have also been an input for music files on a flash drive.",0.0

This thing worked like a dream. That feeling didn't last long. About 9 months to a year later, the screen &#34;Froze&#34;. It would do nothing. None of the functions worked. There were no instructions telling me what to do to fix it. I eventually decided I needed to leave the remote OFF the charging dock. The screen eventually went blank, it took about a week & the remote needed recharging. The next day, the remote was put back into operation. It worked like a dream.....until it happened again & again & again & again. The last time it &#34;Froze&#34; was just over a week ago. It had just finished recharging yesterday & the remote was put back into use. When I got home from work today, I was informed that the screen had &#34;FROZEN&#34; AGAIN. It did not work properly for 24 hours when it &#34;Froze&#34; again. Fortunately, through all of this, I was able to put the Harmony 670 back into service, with new batteries. It works like dream. Does anyone know what is happening when the screen &#34;Freezes&#34; or &#34;Locks-Up&#34; like this? This remote cost too much for this to be happening. This is ridiculous!

"These ear phones looked authentic all the way down to the last detail but were not! I instantly could feel the difference in the materials used and by the way these earbuds would not stay in my ears as every other set of authentic Apple earphones has. DO NOT PURCHASE THESE KNOCKOFFS!!! Pay $10 for an authentic pair from Apple. You can fake the outside, but the inside you can't. The sound of these are awful out of the box also. Another sign they are fake.",0.0

"I rarely write online reviews, but since this speaker is a hefty three-hundo bucks, I felt that it was important to warn potential consumers about this product.<br /><br />The Bass response on this speaker will not be sufficient for those listening to music mixed and produced after 1970.<br /><br />I was amazed at the quality of sound that this speaker had with some genres  I had heard great things about Bose, and finally wanted to be able to own a piece of equipment made by them.  It really seemed as though this speaker is designed to turn the room itself into a giant reverberating speaker cabinet.  While listening to bands with the classic set up of bass-guitar-drums-vocals, I was really enthralled by the sound that this speaker was able to produce.<br /><br />But with Reggae, Hip-Hop, and even some Jazz, this speaker simply could not handle low bass frequencies and distorted like a beat up hoopty rolling down the street with the trunk buzzing and rattling.<br /><br />Use Reggae to test any new speaker you purchase!  Try listening to &#34;Mr. Brown&#34; by Bob Marley, or the album &#34;Return of the Super Ape&#34; by Lee Perry with this speaker and you'll end up returning it.  Even listening to &#34;Othello&#34; by the jazz outfit &#34;Chicago Underground Trio&#34; was distorted and disappointing, and that track only features a traditional acoustic bass, not the ultra low bass used in most contemporary Hippity-Hop compositions.<br /><br />I ended up returning this and purchasing the Harman Kardon Onyx Studio, which was on sale for one hundred pieces of scrilla less than this piece of ish.  The Bose speaker is way more portable, and has a much better battery life, but it is completely unacceptable if I have to pay three hundred for it, and end up avoiding listening to twenty-five percent of my music collection because of its poor low end response.<br /><br />If you're looking for a speaker you can easily pack up into a suit case and set up quickly in a hotel to listen to soothing piccolo-heavy classical music with, by all means, this is the speaker for you, but don't expect to be able to unwind with &#34;It Was a Good Day&#34; by Ice Cube with this over rated piece of equipment.  I hope my next experience with Bose will not be so expensive and disappointing.",0.0

"Bought this from another e-tailer. It was powering a C70M1 AMD C70 CPU/Motherboard combo, and 2 x 2TB HDD's in a salvaged HP SlimLine 3600T case. I have added some cooling fans to the system and the CPU never rose above 50 degrees Celsius under load. So it was quite a surprise when this unit died just 7 days after I received it. I'm not sure if the Cooling Fan is just too weak and the heat built up near the top of the case where this was located, or if I lost the PSU lottery. Either way it was great while it ran, but now I have to wait for an RMA, ship the old unit back, wait for however long it takes Evertech to get back to me, and then wait for it to ship back to me. That's a long while for my file server to be down. I'll update my review once I receive a second one and hope that it lasts far longer.",0.0
"Fell apart after 20 hours of use.  Foam pad split and the plastic housing surrounding the ear speaker dislocated from the main head support.  All I did was put them on my head and I heard a crack, and that was it.  I was really enjoying these but they obviously aren't built to last.",0.0

"I live in the woods in upstate New York.  Read a few reviews that this is good for camping trips and worked in the mountains for somebody else, but it doesn't do anything here at all.  The little (cheap) SW radio I bought also had good reviews but it is lousy also, even in the towns (Norwich, NY), but don't know about this antenna there though as I want to use it where I actually live - in the boonies.  I admit cell phone reception is lousy here also (up living across from statelands), but thought this was supposed to improve reception anyway - it does amply the static very nicely.

"Terrible product and terrible customer service. I ordered this product and was very excited when it came! I have many 33 vinyls and when I was finally able to hook it up, I played a record.

I changed out the record and played a different one. Same result - it shut off again. So I tried using a different outlet. Same result. Finally I tried using a power adapter/surge protector. Nope. Still did the exact same thing. I tried to return my item only to be told it was 2 days outside THEIR return window of 30 days. So now I have an unusable record player that I spent $90 on in the hopes of being able to play my vinyls.

"Background: I swim 3 days a week, ~1:30 each pool session.  In the pool I swim every stroke with flip-turns.  The ear buds stay in.<br />Previous to these Swimbuds I had the Waterfi's that came with the iPod Shuffle I use.<br />- In comparison to the Waterfi Shortcord headphones these headphones are superior for 1 main reason: the earpieces do not come off when removing the bud.  With the Waterfi's, after 1 month of use, the ear pieces stuck in my ear no matter how carefully I tried to remove them, requiring tweezers to remove (not fun at the gym).<br />- The one benefit of the Waterfi is the cord is of perfect length.  The Swimbuds are a little long.  You need to hook them into your goggles so they don't catch on your neck when you rotate to breathe.  So, w/o goggles they would be a problem.<br /><br />One big ouch: after purchasing the headphones in January, this week (August 28th), one of the buds died.<br />If these were $10 headphones, I wouldn't mind, but a $40 pair should last at least a year.<br /><br />Modified Review:<br />After posting this review the seller contacted me.  Even though the warranty had expired, and I completed some minor troubleshooting, the seller is mailing me a replacement set of earphones, so I'm giving them 4 stars for great customer service.  The price is still quite high ($40) which is why I don't provide the 5th star, but as I said they are the best I've used.<br /><br />3rd Review:<br />The replacement pair died after a few 4 months. For $40, they should warranty for at least 2 years.",0.0
"Maybe I just got a bad one but, on the one I purchased at least, battery life was a real issue. It started out at around 3 hours (audio only, no video)and steadily deteriorated.

After another week battery life was down to below an hour and when I returned it about 4 days later battery life was all of 10 minutes.

"If you have a 5GHz wireless network, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! I am pretty sophisticated abound technology and I spent several weeks trying to set this up with my home theater system I figured I would get it right sooner or later.

"This product sucks…it feels like a 5 dollar bud that you buy at a gas station. Although the product has sound clarity and decent range, it will break on you in less than a month (that's how long mine lasted). At first, the buttons were malfunctioning but if pressed harder or at certain areas it worked so I thought it was no problem. Then it completely stopped working after 3 weeks and then the buds stopped working the following week. All in all you get what you pay for…cheap product from a cheap distributor that will not replace items if broken (even if it has been under 30 days).<br /><br />Stay away from Japan Imports…they will not replace malfunctioning products, I should have gone with BestBuy Bose earbuds, outstanding mids but not as much range from highs to lows. Even though they are not as much range in sound…they still have outstanding clarity and mids that will blow any competitor out of the water, not including the 3yr warranty that will replace any malfunction product for only 15 dollars more.",0.0

They offer sub part  sound quality. Nothing special about the sound quality it's not going to be amazing. At this price range your better off buying over ear headphones  for $20 or less because the extra 10-20 dollars is not worth it especially if you expect better quality. I had a pair of 20 dollar skull candy on ear headphones that offered the same sound quality. In terms of comftrability it's light and flimsy. So yeah you don't stretch about it being a nuisance  but I wouldn't expect this pair to last beyond a few months because they are certainly not durable. Feel cheap as well as look cheap. They don't fold so get ready to carry this hunk of **** every where you go. Overall not worth the price would not recommend. Better off going cheaper. Total let down,0.0
"I purchased this headset in April and for several months they seemed to work well.  The fit wasn't perfect, but it was good enough that I was able to use them for my daily workout.  Unfortunately a couple of days ago the right earbud stopped working altogether, and the left got a teeny bit of static.  I sweat a goodly amount and I'm assuming that is what did these in- unfortunate given that they're supposed to be sweat resistant.  A google search for Senbowe's customer service doesn't show up anything at all, it's circular back to the products being sold on Amazon.

I am very happy with these. They fit over my ears and have excellent sound. These may only be the 40's but the bass is booming.  May 4 2016:  I downgraded to1 stars because the charging port on the headphone is very poorly constructed.  Through multiple charges the plastic that holds it in place weakened and broke.  I pulled the headphones apart and got it back together twice but eventually the little plastic tabs on the charging port broke off as well.  Then I tried to jury rig something to hold it in place but the wire broke off the circuit board. This is such a high stress area because you have to plug the charger cord every day or so.  The plastic tabs holding it in place inside the headphone case are very small and delicate.  Poor design for this purpose.  I loved them until they quit working though.   I bought them on August 23 2015 and they broke the first time on Dec 15 so less than 4 months for $100.  Not worth it.,0.0
"I'm sorry, but I just don't get it.  I'm beginning to think that digital conversion just isn't possible.  I've been wanting to convert my print photos for some time now.  I thought I had put this off for too long, but now I'm thinking I haven't waited long enough.<br /><br />I ordered this thing because of the generally great reviews, prices, and simplicity of Wolverine.  I was mostly interested in the negative scanner, but I decided to go ahead and shell the extra $30 for a photo scanner as well.<br /><br />I decided to be objective about this, so I scanned the negatives and originals of 5 photos that were about 10 years old.  The photo scan looks worse than when I snap an old pick on my phone for Facebook.  In fact, the only advantage this scanner has over a phone snap is the straighter alignment of the image.  Even that is tentative, as this device forces you to place the negative in a plastic strip with windows, and the slots on my negatives didn't quite line up.<br /><br />Of course, the negative scanner produces better results--by lightyears--but the image quality is still just crap.  My wife suggested that I shrink the image on my screen to its approximate print size, and that helped a little.  But the image looks grainy and ancient at any resolution.  The other thing that sucks about the negative scanner is that the tiniest dust particle or fiber takes up a quarter of the converted image.  A brush is included for this sort of thing, but rebrushing all 10k or so of my family photos is literally impossible.<br /><br />I remember feeling this way when flatbed scanners first became affordable.  Then, as now, I had unreasonable expectations that the digital eye could capture a close approximation of my photos.  I did some research this time and learned about DPI and megapixels.  The industry standard for digital conversion seems to be 600 DPI, which is something like 3500x2500 resolution.  This device was scanning my negatives at about twice that resolution, butit just doesn't make much difference.  It's way better than the photo scan, but these devices do a TERRIBLE job of capturing the nature of the image.<br /><br />I just don't understand why anyone would use this technology to convert their photos; and I don't understand how we're supposed to save our memories for the future, when this technology can't even come close to capturing the spirit of a printed photo.",0.0

"Wanted it to be a five star review, but instead had to honestly give it only one star. Worked with it for a few days with no great success. Using the Amazon internal flat antenna I received 34 channels and the best I could get with this antenna was 14 channels. Was looking for better reception with the roof mount some 20 feet up with not obstructions between us and the towers some 24 miles away but not only was it not better but we lost some of the best channels using this antenna Remote buttons as other have stated were not a true left and right movement of the antenna. Push the left button one time and it goes in one direction and after that when you push the button again it could go in either direction, so fine tuning is pretty much by luck only. The best way we found to get the best results was to have  one person inside with the remote and the TV and one person outside telling the inside person which way the antenna  went. You just keep going until you get the most channels and the best reception. Extremely directional with not much room for error.

"Many people have purchased these black CD-Rs because they have found, as I have, that they have a lower error rate and superior sound quality to the silver CDs.  I purchased these discs for years for this reason.  However, in the last couple of months, I have tried ordering them from a couple of suppliers, and have received discs that have the same top label as before, but the bottom readable side is actually silver, the same as any other.  I have contacted Memorex directly about this, and they confirmed that they are using the same labels as before, however, they have discontinued manufacturing CDs with a black optical side.  Therefore, if you order these, YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE BLACK CDs.  It is extremely disingenuous for Memorex to change the product without changing any of the labeling or item description.  Unless you are buying these just for the look of the top portion, which I doubt anyone was, don't waste your time and money on this product anymore.",0.0

"[[VIDEOID:3b39ba5302617ae5fa8e7aef59c0ac0b]]I was hoping to use this splitter to pass the sound from my Amazon TV Fire Stick to a sound bar and 5.1 surround sound system, rather than playing through my TV. However, the way that this functions, the sound always plays from the TV itself (in addition to the split outputs) in all 3 modes. This wouldn't be so bad if the split audio and the TV audio were ever in sync, however, there's a significant lag at almost half a second so there is an echo making listening to both music and playing video unacceptable. You could always mute the TV, but the lag is on the split audio, so it's still off from the picture on the screen, even without the echo, it's annoying that the sound doesn't match what's on the screen. The pass through mode doesn't work either, if I just wanted audio output to the TV. It continued to play the split audio when switched into this mode. This product just didn't work for me.",0.0
"Please don't waste your hard earned money on these things.  It appears the vast majority of people gave these speakers a high rating.  I can only assume those reviews were written within the first few weeks to months of using these speakers when the speakers do sound really good.  But after the first couple months, the quality issues of these speakers will start to show up.  I initially purchased one at Walmart and soon had the USB charging connection completely fall out of the thing.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt and exchanged this for another, which I then paired with another soon after.  I did really like the stereo paring capabilities of these speakers.  All was well for a few weeks until I noticed that the battery life on these things fell significantly, particularly with the volume turned up.  I soon was lucky if I got 30 minutes of battery life out of these speakers before they turned off with a happy little chime signaling the end of my party.  So, the fast forward a few months ahead with little or no use.  I decided I would like to pair them with my new cell phone.  After turning them on and pairing with my phone, I noticed that the maximum volume of the speakers is now significantly reduced.  So, now $60.00 and 6 months later, I am now looking for another set of blue tooth speakers.  These are real junk.",0.0

"After a long search for a really good set of speakers for my desktop computer, I decided to try one of these.  I wanted to minimize the clutter and cables.  This speaker has good sound but the base is way too heavy in my opinion.  Overall, you get a lot of good sound out of such a small package but...<br />The reasons I hate this thing are:<br />DISCLAIMER: I never even attempted trying to setup or use the Bluetooth functionality of this speaker so I cannot speak about that feature.  Also, I intended to use this guy as my primary/only speaker(s) for my desktop computer.  I understand that this speaker isn't really designed to be used that way, but it was small, has an AC power adapter, an AUX stereo input port, and it was supposed to have good sound--that's what I want in desktop speakers!<br />-It turns off automatically after short period of inactivity, even when it's plugged into AC power.  If I have it plugged into the wall and I press the power button to turn it on, then the POS should stay turned on until I decide to turn it off.  Period.  If you're going to build in this feature, then the least you could do is provide a way (e.g., button combination) of disabling that feature in case you want the speaker to stay on constantly when plugged into AC power--what if I pause my source while I take a 5 minute phone call?  I don't want to sit back down and find out that this thing has turned itself off.<br />-EVERY time you power the speaker back on, the volume level is reset to the default level, which is WAY TOO LOUD.<br />-If you have a source plugged into the AUX port (and are not using the Bluetooth functionality), the first time you touch the volume level on whatever source you have, the volume level of the speaker immediately jumps to get in sync.  From that point forward, the volume levels of the speaker and your source are in sync but that's just a pain.",0.0

"This is seriously one of the worst purchases I've ever made. I bought it and then it worked for a few minutes later the cable started acting finicky and would only work is held a certain way... Obviously I'm not going to watch TV with my hand in a funky position just so I can get a picture on the screen. So then after that, I went ahead and asked for a replacement. I got a replacement the next day (very good) but even THAT cable didn't work. I hooked it up to the TV and was very excited because it was working then BAM this crappy cable stopped working too. It's absolutely ridiculous and a waste of money. So i've asked for a refund, and they can have their crappy cable back. I'm ordering a new one from another company.",0.0

"Hate this clock.

It's also too easy to accidentally lower the volume when trying to set the alarm. To turn the alarm off, you have to press hard on a button on the front, which pushes the clock across whatever surface you have it on, until it bumps up against something solid so that you can actually turn it off.

None of our normal remotes ever stopped functioning.  After a couple of years of toughing it out with individual remotes, again, I decided to try a universal remote again.  After reading all the reviews, I decided to try this one again.  We bought it in April.  It is now August and it no longer functions.

"A real pieced of junk !  I bought two of these solar units to supplement my regular 110 V plug in battery re charger. Filled both new units with new Tenergy D cell batteries and put them in the sun (in Central Florida in August) for two full cloudless days. Checked them with a battery tester and they showed barley charged. Put them in my 110 V charger and it indicated they were about 1/8 charged, at which rate it would take 16 days of cloudless sky's to fully charge 4 D cell batteries on these solar chargers. Now I can be patient but 16 days to charge 4 batteries is frankly just not workable in the real world. This is nothing but fraud.

"I bought this model to replace an older model which I loved.  It worked great for maybe 2 months.  The sound is fantastic.  Great bass and treble.  But then they stopped charging, and my pc wouldn't recognize the device.  Apparently, this was a known problem with Sony because I dug out my paperwork and found a special insert describing how to clean the charging contacts on the headphones.  After about 3 cleanings with a toothbrush, they finally started working again.  Great!  But wait...another 2 months later, same thing.  Another 4 attempts at cleaning, and they worked again.  But wait...another 2 months, and nothing.  I've now been been trying to clean them for the past 3 days.  I wait at least 12 hours between cleanings to make sure everything is completely dry.  Still nothing. As far as I'm concerned, they're junk now.  Note to Sony...If this is a known problem, it's obviously a design defect.  But a year later, you're still offering this defective design.  Go back to the simple USB plugin charger.  I'm now in the market for a new pair.  If this is the only Sony model I can get, then I'm going with a different brand.",0.0

"I rarely write reviews; however, after not being able to replace this item, I thought I would help out future buyers.  BEWARE.  I purchased this SoundBot, and after two months the unit started to lose time.  I was skeptical to begin with due to the steep discount applied ($35 vs $100 advertised retail cost).  The core function of this product is to display the time, and if it can't do that it is pretty useless to me.  I have moved this into my guest room, as I cannot function with the time being off.  I just fixed the time again this evening, as it was off 11 minutes.  The only reason why I have not just thrown it away is because I can still allow my guests to use it to play their bluetooth music.<br /><br />To clarify, this unit plugs in and is not battery dependent.  Therefore, there is no justification for the loss of time other than a defective product.  Due to being out of the return/replace time period, I am out of luck.  I hope SoundBot reads this review, and replaces my item.<br /><br />Hope this does not happen to anyone else.

"Just got it.  One of the two LEDs isn't lighting up, so I don't know if that side is charging.  Also, the piece which flips down to accommodate AAA batteries won't stay in place, so they pop right out.  I see that it is flexing super-thin wires every time you flip it up and down, so it might not last long if you do that, frequently, anyhow.  But the defects aren't really the big problem.  The killer is that it's extremely inefficient, doing the voltage step-down by wasting a ton of power as heat via a couple big resistors... this thing gets ridiculously warm in operation (and I'm not talking about the batteries themselves--they stay nice and cool).  I bought this to charge batteries from a solar panel, but the ridiculous amount of wasted power will put me FAR over my power budget, so this is $2 down the drain, and a month waiting for this charger wasted.  Any idiot could design a charger many times more efficient than this, without even increasing the price.  It is just a piece of junk that I will end up throwing away. Even for $1 it isn't worth it, and I'd be furious if I paid $10 like some of the other listings are asking for. The seller (Sold by: Peking_hotels) clearly doesn't care what a piece of junk it is, and completely dismissed these problems.  You can currently get this same item [[ASIN:B00YWNB8J8 slightly cheaper from another seller]].  According to the specs (I haven't double checked them), this will take over 12 hours to fully charge a AA battery, and at least 5 hours for a AAA battery.

"Do not buy this. The ear buds are so cheaply made. I used them for running. Whenever the part with the microphone buttons touched my top, it changed the song or turned on Siri. I tried attaching it to different places on my shirt, but it still jumped the apps around. The second time I ran with it, I wrapped it around my neck to make sure the button didn't hit my shirt, but it still made my phone switch on Siri. Finally today I ran with them and got so frustrated that I broke the button off completely in the middle of my run, and it STILL made the music and running apps stop. So the problem is in the wiring, not the button. The ear fit is just fine but these ear buds will drive you crazy. Complete waste of money.",0.0

"These are horrible items.  I bought 2 -- yes they are inexpensive and you get what you pay for -- and should have returned them immediately.  One items was difficult to connect and is difficult to manipulate because the software menu is not intuitive.  The second item didn't connect to any of the PCs in the household (Windows 7 and Windows 8).<br /><br />Using just the one that did connect I found it to be difficult to set up play lists.  The only way to transfer music is to drag and drop it like using an ordinary flash drive.  Playlists have to be set up in individual folders -- there was no way using software that I could create one and transfer it.  The device has a transfer program from Roxio that automatically pops up but it didn't recognize any of the music directories on the PC including the default &#34;my documents / my music&#34;<br /><br />Once music was loaded it was difficult to use the menu system because the buttons were not always responsive. I'd end up in one folder (the recommended way to sort your music titles) and unable to get out of it.  The sound is acceptable and the battery life is pretty good, but functionality is severely limited.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend buying this -- you're better off to put the money toward a better product.",0.0

"FRUSTRATING!!  CONNECTION: I purchased these headphones to use when I'm working in the yard, cutting the grass and other yard work. I like to keep my phone in my back pocket when doing this. I would set up itunes or spotify and get my playlist going, put it in my back pocket and within 2 minutes it starts dropping out and losing its connection to my phone. This is extremely frustrating since I either have to finish the task for which I bought this headphones to accompany, or stop, take off my gloves and get a connection again, but this would be every few minutes. I emailed Amazon and they immediately offered to replace them at no charge. I made the exchange and had a brand new pair. I tried them and it's the same thing. Also, when I play the music with the phone laying on the table in front of me or in my hand closer to the headphones, its perfectly fine, its just when it's in my back pocket, and I dont have a metal hip or anything. That was with the iphone 5S, I thought maybe it was old phone technology, so I upgraded to the latest at the time, iphone 6S with my fingers crossed. No luck, the same thing. it drops out and disconnects when in my back pocket. It is some better but not much when in my front pocket. I know some may say &#34;well then just put it in your front pocket. That's not the point. Its more comfortable to keep it in my back pocket doing that kind of work and it's only 36&#34; max from the headphones. it should work.  SOUND QUALITY: I had been using the Bose wired ear buds before purchasing the Beats wireless ear buds. The Bose wired have some amazing sound for ear buds with the Bose the lows are really deep and full. Not so with the BEATS though. The lows are tinny at best and when I contacted Beats they suggested I try different ear pieces. I tried all they supplied plus purchased aftermarket ones to try. I don't have abnormally shaped ears and any other ear buds always fit fine, even the hard plastic non conforming apple ear buds. The only way to get good full sound from my Beats was to press them into my ears where it almost hurt.  These now have been sitting on my shelf in the case for the last 6 months not used while I wait for another option to come out. It's a shame that a $200 set of headphones has this many issues that a company like Beats and Apple can't figure out!  Note to Beats: Yes,  I would take another pair or upgraded pair to try for free. Just contact me with the offer.",0.0

"UPDATE 9/10/2015: The headphones stopped working today. Not a battery issue...just quit. They aren't eligible to be returned. I guess I'm on my own and not happy about wasting my money. [end Update]  I bought the QuietPoint ATH-ANC7b active noise-canceling headphones for an international flight. These are my first noise-canceling headphones and they do what they advertise. I like the audio quality when I play music through them, too. However, I often receive audible radio frequency interference in the form of patterned static-like noise. This tends to happen when I use them with my iPhone 6 Plus. It also happens at certain points during my daily commute to work. Shielding or canceling those unwanted signals would seem to be a priority for Audio-Technica. While the headphones do knock back ambient sound well and have reasonable audio playback quality, they introduce annoying, interfering sounds which strikes me as a significant failure. To attempt to mitigate this issue I try switching the active mode off and then back on repeatedly, but that doesn't consistently resolve the problem. I'd give less stars if they didn't perform well when they aren't &#34;acting up.&#34;",0.0

"I received the earphones (Zipbuds SLIDE Earbuds with Mic and Tangle Free Zipperless Zipper )  and immediately proceeded to unpack the box.

All of this great experience came down burning when everyone I attempted to talk to on my iPhone while using them said: I can barely hear you, you sound far away, muffled like in a can :(  So I found myself very disappointed and had to return them.  I can't understand how can the manufacturer succeed so well at getting the &#34;earphone&#34; part of the audio right (which is the hardest part), while failing at the easier part (microphone).

"This 7AH solution is stated as a replacement for 9AH batteries. If used with a UPS designed for 9AH batteries, like the APC XS 1500 series, your emergency run time will be shorter, and the load could demand more than the batteries can supply - shortening the life of the batteries and causing high temperatures (issues reported by other reviewers here but not knowing why).

"Update – I have had to stop using this clock after several months of operation.  The clock just stops momentarily, resetting to 12:00 midnight on Jan 1.  I initially thought that the AC power was being stopped because the input from the transformer might have come loose, so I arranged to it to be attached more securely, but the same thing still happened, even though there was no one near the connection when the interruption occurred.  I then went to battery power, but the projection system does not work on battery power, so I used both the battery and AC in hopes that if there was an interruption in the AC then the battery backup would prevent the clock from resetting, but it does not.  Even a broken clock is right twice a day, but when this clock resets it is never right, and gives an erroneous time.  I have therefore had to downgrade from two to only one star.<br /><br />Original review<br />I do not recommend this clock for the reasons described below.  The clock worked and I purchased it on a half price closeout, so as a clock it was OK, but overpriced if you just operate it as a simple digital clock, hence two stars instead of the minimum one.<br /><br />Why do I call this a “brain dead” - described below in order of the most annoying features first:<br />· The projector feature is poorly designed.  When you face the clock, it projects the time on the wall behind or above the clock upside down and backwards.  The time is projected correctly on the wall facing the clock and can therefore be read when you are facing this wall and have your back towards the clock.  However, this most likely requires projecting the time more than the six foot focusing distance, as it did in my case.  The result is a large somewhat blurry image.  The correct orientation is also displayed when you turn the clock with its back facing you, so you can only read the projected time on the wall facing the clock.  BETTER PROJECTOR CLOCKS HAVE THE ABILITY TO FLIP THE IMAGE IN ORDER TO CORRECT FOR THIS, and give you the ability to view the correct image with the clock in a different orientation relative to the way that you are facing.  Also, while the projector can be rotated about one axis, that is all.  Therefore, I found it impossible to orient both the clock and the projected image to optimum orientations.<br /><br />· The clock face is tilted backwards at a fixed angle, which cannot be adjusted.  This made it difficult to read the clock while lying in bed, and required me to make a jury-rigged system to keep the face at an orientation where I could read the clock.  Unfortunately, the clock was less stable in this position, requiring still further modifications.  Even a moderately thoughtful deign would have eliminated this problem without adding to the coat of the clock.<br /><br />· The temperature readings were three degrees high (compared to two other digital thermometers in the room).  This may seem petty, but if you are interested on knowing the temperature and its changes over a period of days you should at least see the correct value.  This incorrect value may be due to the heat given off by the projecting LED and there is no way to turn off the projector, except to run completely on batteries.  (The clock can be run completely on battery power, or with the batteries as a backup for a power failure but unused when the clock is running on AC.)<br /><br />· The clock is very bright, perhaps too bright when you are trying to sleep and there is no way to reduce the brightness.  The numbers are 1/2 an inch high as opposed to ¾ of an inch on other clocks.  Instead of a larger image this clock has color bands that go up and down and cycle, illustrating the temperature changes over the last five days.  The bands take up most of the lower half of the clock face and I found them to be distracting, so I had to cover over this feature, as there is no way to turn it off.<br /><br />· Setting the clock up was a pain – not at all intuitive and probably almost impossible without the instructions, so if you lose them the clock might become useless.<br /><br />All in all this is a prime example of a poor (brain dead) design.  The clock would have been more useful as more than a simple clock if the clock face could be tilted and more useful as a projector clock if the projected image could be rotated about more than one axis and flipped so that it could be read when one was facing the clock, instead of only when the clock face is not also visible.  Rather than having these features, the clock has multiple alarm choices, which were difficult to set up, and the ability to set up a “special day” setting, which is very confusing to set up as it is easily confused with the actual date setup.e them the clock might become useless.

"I am sending this product back.  The reason for the return is that on Amazon, the product is described as &#34;waterproof&#34; and &#34;water resistant&#34; but when I received your product the box and the literature say &#34;splash proof&#34;.  The difference in these three descriptions is considerable, specifically that waterproof means it can be submerged, water resistant means it can withstand being exposed to water for a specified amount of time and/or depth and splash proof means it will not be adversely affected by a splash of water, which is virtually meaningless.  We, the customers, are provide no information to the amount of water it can withstand.  I am disappointed that Amazon and Alphatronix would not provide identical information about the product as it is clearly written on the information provided by Alphatronix.  In addition, I should not be required to register your product to receive a warranty coverage because you do not outline that detail on the Amazon site, which is illegal.  The federal law requires you to outline a warranty with all the specifics, please review this at consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0252-warranties.

I can't even begin to organize this review, I was so disappointed. I usually order Prime and this was not, but because I thought JVC would provide me a certain minimum quality sound I went for it. Huge regret. It sounded distorted, even without my other headset to compare it to. There was pleanty of static noise and the sound was weak. I seriously thought the item was defective (still do since another reviewer rated this a 5) and the seller requested that I work it out with JVC. No. Not gonna waste my time and even though return shipping is not free I'd rather pay it than go through all that hassle.

"Can't get any simpler that this.  And it works just about anywhere you can find a flat lip or side panel.

It is really a nifty place to stow the headphones--within easy reach, but not a cumbersome location either.<br /><br />It is well-constructed with  good layer of powder coating on the metal.  Hardware looks to be top quality, too.<br /><br />*I received a sample product from Brainwavz.",1.0

I own a pair of Audio Technica M50x and these for me are much better. They are much more open and a pleasure to listen to any music. I listen to music mostly on my iPad and have a subscription to Tidal premium musi service right now. The clarity of the music is amazing. These headphones also are a great bargain at $108.99 on Amazon. I'm very happy with my purchase.,1.0

"[[VIDEOID:3bdd17778455ef097fcffb1d018022b6]] There is a good variance in Bluetooth speakers, from physical design, extras in the box and sound quality. Not all speakers are worth your time and money. This little Cube speaker by iGadgitz is a very interesting speaker; it may be little but it has big sound and it works very well. I did find one potential issue when it comes to the range of operation that I will describe below.<br /><br />This is one of the smallest speakers I have seen and used. In spite of its size, it is a solid and hefty little speaker, weighing more than you'd expect. In my mind this is a good sign: it means that there is more to this little speaker than a cheap little speaker and a sub-par receiver. To be honest I was a little skeptical that it would put out good sound when I first saw this speaker. It has pleasantly surprised me (more on that shortly).<br /><br />This speaker pairs and connects very easily. When it is in discoverable mode it identifies itself as \\""Xquare 2\\"". I had no issue with it pairing to my phone and once connected it remained connected without issue.<br /><br />The range on this speaker is good and I have been able to carry it from the source to a distance between 20' - 30' before it began to stutter or cut out. I have seen speakers that have more range but the majority of them fall into this threshold. Now, that said I need to mention an issue that came up in testing that should be kept in mind. If the speaker is sitting such that the switch and controls are facing down (that is, the control side is on the flat surface where it is sitting) the range is cut very dramatically. With the speaker sitting that way the range dropped to about 6' before it started cutting out. It did not seem to matter if it was the speaker that was moving away from the source or the other way around.<br /><br />I loaded up some music and played it through this speaker and was pleased with the outcome. The speaker has no problem with playing at higher volume, without distortion or \\""washing out\\"". The profile is very good too - the bass is strong and slightly elevated but not overkill, the midrange is very good and the music has depth as a result, and the highs are bright and crisp. For such a small speaker, this one produces better-than-expected sound.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite Bluetooth speakers. It is very small but it has excellent sound and is made very well. The size makes it placeable in areas where other speakers are too bulky to fit. This speaker proves that smaller speakers can have great sound and it's worth its asking price.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.er volume, without distortion or \\""washing out\\"".

"So, I wouldn't have purchased this if it were not for my wife, who is infinitely frustrated with my audio setup.<br /><br />I needed something that would sit next to our TV, and be simple to use.  The fact that this has a remote is a nice bonus.  The fact that this can grab my local radio stations is a HUGE bonus - one which I didn't know it could do (does it via streaming).<br /><br />My problem is that I have this setup:<br /><br />Computer requests audio to be played from a Linux computer which uses a M2Tech Hiface to stream digital to my DAC (streamed lossless FLAC).  This then feeds into my preamp, and then amp and speakers.  To access the linux computer that runs the whole show, I have to have her use shell login to my linux host (not easy for most people, and if something goes wrong, she can't fix it).  You can then  from command line play pandora or music.<br /><br />So, those issues being stated, after plenty of research, I chose this.  I can connect this up right into my preamp, and she can use it pretty easily.  The setup was a snap, follow a few instructions, and I'm now linked up with my pandora account (I've got probably 40 stations I've been grooming for years).  Great.<br /><br />I had mistook the &#34;antenna&#34; in the product pictures for a coax hookup for an AM/FM antenna.  In fact this hookup is for the antenna to your wireless router.  Very fortunately, this nice box has the great feature of being able to pickup any radio station that streams their broadcasts (which as it turns out, is almost all of the local stations).  Not only that, but I can get stations that I would otherwise not be able to get at all (since I don't rely on an antenna, just whatever I choose to stream).  how do I get my local stations?  Simple !  you just set your location (enter your city I believe).  And it'll select the right stations for where you are.  It will also allow you to then progress outwards and grab more stations that you wouldn't otherwise be able to get with an antenna of probably any size.  I live in Baltimore, and it allows me to get stations hundreds of miles away!  Very slick!!<br /><br />The one downside to this product is that the built-in amplifier is really pretty poor quality.  However, I didn't buy this for that functionality anyway.  I only ended up using it, as my preamp crapped out, and I'm stuck using the built in amp for the time being.  It's nice that it's available, but don't think that if you have decent speakers, that you'll get very good sound quality.  You're much better off using the 'line out' and putting this into your favorite receiver or preamp, as the built in one just isn't so great, but it's functional.ith an antenna of probably any size.

"[[VIDEOID:46129030a61a028dbd8e69c13b30606]] Please watch the video for more specifics.<br />I enjoyed using this Bluetooth speaker from TaoTronics.<br />You should wet the suction cup or else it will not stick very, once you do that you should be fine.<br />The audio is very clear the sound is very good overall but the bass may lack a little bit due to the size which is to be expected.<br />I found it interesting the typical double tapping of the phone button is not how you call the last caller, instead you must hold the button down which is different than what I'm used to but something worth noting.<br />It takes approximately two hours to charge after which you can expect 5-6 hours of playback from the 500mAh battery. When the battery is low it will beep to indicate that it's time for it to be recharged<br />The included user manual is very clear and very easy to read.<br />The charging ports is well covered so no issue there with water.<br />As you remember to wet the suction cup it will actually stick but if you do not it will probably only stick for a matter of minutes I found.<br />You can't submerged in water completely obviously but splashes here and there shouldn't be an issue.<br />Review sample provided free or at a discounted price for a fair, unbiased, and honest review.",1.0
"[[VIDEOID:ca7421903fd1ad5c64ae1dc42a160649]] Earbuds have always been an issue for me. Mine is one of those stereotypical stories -- I can't find a pair that fits my ears well. I've tried so many types of earbuds and most of them give my ear canals some sort of fatigue. It's not that they sound bad, just that keeping them in my ears for more than 10 minutes is painful. The only ones I could tolerate were the Apple EarPods, and I have a love/hate relationship with them. Sure, they sit nicely in my ears, but them being fully open means I lose my music to the crickets of night and pelicans of day. Well, no more! I found the Flare R2A in-ear monitors, and seems my fear of earbuds is over.<br /><br />Disclaimer: This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />The R2s began their life on Kickstarter with a campaign that raised over $170,000. That's quite a lot for IEMs, which are a rather niche market. Flare is a British company that strives for excellence in sound, and hopes that the world can join them in this pursuit. Before the R2s, the company made loudspeakers, so in-ears is a bit of a different industry. I think they did a fine job of things.<br /><br />I listen to a lot of different genres of music, but mostly folk and dream pop lately. To test out the R2s, I listened to hip-hop, jazz, EDM, instrumental guitar and piano, rock, classical, and of course the aforementioned folk. They performed consistently well in every genre. They also look great.<br /><br />First, of course, the sound. These IEMs aren't active noise canceling or anything fancy, which is good because noise canceling often diminishes the sound quality. The R2s are still great for keeping outside noises to a minimum. They use the same plushy foam tips as earplugs, which makes for a comfortable and quiet listening environment. I tried them at work, in the bus, walking down a busy road, and even in a studio while recording. There's absolutely no sound leakage at all, which is great for quiet environments, and none of the quality seems to be lost when the environment is noisy.<br /><br />People sometimes rant about flat response and how it's better than everything else. Those people might be troubled by the R2s. They're warmer than most earbuds, but don't have muddy bass. The main issue with earbuds is always treble: there's way too much of it everywhere. Then Skullcandy wanted to have fun so they started adding a bunch of bass to the mix. Everything above 80Hz seemed to have been lost. The R2s have none of those problems -- highs are crisp, mids cut through well, and the lows of course deliver the much-needed punch, rather than a drone. The responsiveness of everything is very tight.<br /><br />As I said before, everything I listened to with these IEMs sounded wonderful. They revealed details in songs that I didn't know were there, while also being comfortable, affordable, and easy to use. The highs were not overbearing, but pronounced; the high-mids don't clutter the highs at all; the low-mids keep all the bass lines in check; and the lows make sure you remember that the bass drum exists without making you forget about the guitars in the mid-range. That's a great achievement. I really love the way these sound. Everything is balanced. Overall, it's a bit warm, but I would much rather it be warm than sound like tinny old Apple earbuds from the early 2000s, with their mesh and bass-less muddle.<br /><br />On to the design. These things are beautifully minimal, but aren't trying to be artistic, which is nice for a change. The earbuds themselves are black (or whatever color you chose), and the tips and cable match that. There's also a rectangular machined aluminum box that splits the stereo signal for the left and right channels. It doesn't need to be as big as it is, but it does add some pizzazz to things. Lastly, there's the 3.5mm connector, which on mine is black with two gold stripes running through it.<br /><br />I love the design, but there's one ergonomic inconsistency: The aluminum box. It looks cool, and I can see why the designer would have put it there. However, if you want to use these as a versatile pair of IEMs, you may walk with them once in a while, or just move around a bit. The latter is inevitable, and when you do choose to move around you'll hear some strange thudding sounds. That's the box attempting to defy gravity. Every time I hear this I tell myself it's cool to look at, but doesn't need to be so heavy and certainly doesn't add any special functionality. The heaviness, I suppose, adds value to the IEMs. I would just prefer it wasn't here, especially when I'm using these to perform.<br /><br />While these are \\""reference\\"" series -- at least according to the marketing by Flare -- I don't recommend using them for referencing. The R2s don't produce a completely flat sound like Sonys do. They're amazing for listening to, but not necessarily for studio work. I tried mixing a few song using them just for fun, and I noticed that most of my mixes tended to lose the low-mid range on other speakers and headphones simply because the R2s are warm. This characteristic is great when listening to music, but not for mixing/producing it.<br /><br />If you're a musician, you'll find that these are great for monitoring (and thus they are named in-ear monitors). I used them to monitor my vocals and piano while recording an entire song and they worked great. The warmth helps make things less straining on the ears, and there's not so much bass that I get a headache using them after a while. I also used these to monitor my synth and the rest of the band while playing live, and the foam tips isolated the sound very well.<br /><br />It's worth noting that since these are in-ear monitors, there is no microphone. The aluminum block in the middle of the cable just acts as a splitter -- there's no hidden microphone. At first this bugged me, because I would receive a call and forget I couldn't use these headphones to talk. After a while, I just accepted it. There's no reason for IEMs to have a microphone since there's no way for you to use it as a talkback to your band or anything. It also goes against the way that Flare built these, which is to solely focus on recreating sound accurately, not adding more sound. Bottom line: A microphone would have been useful, but there isn't one, and that shouldn't be a deal breaker.<br /><br />Here's the verdict: The R2s made me like earbuds again. I was considering the Shure SE215s, but these reign superior. Once they're in my ears, I don't feel like I need to take them out. They feel at home. Even Apple's EarPods, which \\""sit\\"" in my ears nicely, don't make me forget that I'm listening to music through small pieces of plastic in my ears. The R2s do, and they don't look ridiculous like some earbuds. My friend even told me he didn't notice I was wearing them because they're so small.

Just bought my second and third one of these.  The first one backs up a desktop computer and monitor and easily runs it for 15 minutes after a power outage.  The new ones are to power my cable box (Comcast) because even the briefest flicker of power and the box goes through the whole five minutes restart procedure.  The other one is just for the modem/router/VOIP/NAT devices.  We don't lose power very often or for very long periods of time but keeping all those devices from resetting and rebooting is worth the price of these inexpensive UPS devices (paid $45 each).  Batteries are easily replaceable and about $17 each for the generic brand.,1.0

"Great product, sturdy, works like a breeze and came very handy for my rack (attached picture). The two front receptacles are great when you work with a laptop in front of the rack and need to charge it, including your cell phone. I chose this version with and Amp meter, even though it still shows zero dot zero, but that's because I ended up plugging in very light applications like cable modem, IR repeater, USB fan, etc. Otherwise, if you plug in a hair dryer for testing purposes, you will start seeing the amps come up. So it does work, and very well. It is only a few inches deep. Few tips: always leave some space above or below the unit, so that if you plug in AC/DC adapters (those that come with small routers and modems), you will have enough clearance to plug the adapters in the back. Otherwise you can always buy those very short NEMA extensions to clear the path (http://www.amazon.com/C2G-Cables-03114-Outlet-Extension/dp/B0002J1KRQ/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1440983975&sr=8-4&keywords=nema+extension).

This product works great despite severe hearing problems.  I can't imagine it not being able to wake someone between the very loud alarm and the vibrations of the pod.  Easy to use and there are adjustments for the loudness and tome of the alarm as well as a dimmer for the LCD brightness.<br /><br />It is a bit larger than we thought it would be (perhaps I didn't check dimensions before ordering) so be aware this is pretty big for your nightstand.,1.0

"The main reason I picked this clock was because of the time projection. I was leery about it because I didn't think I would be happy. But, I'm glad I went with this one. My deciding factor was the advertised aux input to use it as a speaker (others did not say that was an option). It arrived quickly and was pretty easy to set up as well. The actual clock screen is able to be seen by me (a wearer of glasses) from where I lay about 8 feet away, and I aimed the projector across the room near the ceiling which is about 20 feet and I can see it perfectly. Neither light is overly bright but is still able to be seen without strain.",1.0
"This was exactly what I was looking for. I am terrified of storms and thought this would be perfect to keep with my emergency supplies, which is was. I haven't had to test it in an emergency situation yet but the radio works great. It also has a flashlight on it and a port to charge your phone or usb devices. You are able to hand crank it for power so if you was to run out of batteries this would be the perfect back up for you. I am very pleased with this radio and very happy I had the pleasure to test it. I received this product at a promotional price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review",1.0

"What can I say. The Status Classic headphones are a miracle. The quality of the sound is up there with the very best on ear headphones but these are a fraction of the price.

Well done!",1.0
"It works with third party no name brand PS2 turbo controller, very good little adapter.",1.0

"Used with: iPhone 4<br /><br />The round housing, often called &#34;gamer's earbuds&#34; is the key element in giving big BEWM BEWM bass (thus the appellation &#34;gamers earbuds, 'cuz we like da pew pew BEWM).  The wood housing, like any wood body instrument, creates additional resonance - though prolonged use will get the best and warmest response as the wood goes through a break-down process, just like a wood body acoustic guitar.<br /><br />Highs are very crisp, as well.  I do prefer a mellow overall spectrum, yet I did finally find a decent Virtual EQ on the Apple Store that toned that treble right down, and boosted the bass even further.  BEWM BEWM... big bada BEWM.<br /><br />Oh ya, big sound from an economical set.<br /><br />- Complimentary product provided for evaluation, yet my thinking here reflects all my personal purchasing decision processes, and hopefully may help clarify if this best meets your own needs and expectations.",1.0

"I have purchased two of these charger.  One was purchased for my wife to avoid confusion over charging requirement of various devices.  The charger turned out to provide a great deal of convenience.  She uses it for an iPad 4, iPhone 5s, iPod Touch, Nook Glow Reader, Samsung Nook 7 inch tablet, Motarola Bluetooth headset and an Auxiliary Chargng Battery.  Each of these charge without any issues.  After approximately three months I purchased an additional one for my use.  My use is about the same as above with a Sumsung Rugby phone instead of an iPhone.  There has been no problem with any one or combination of devices.  I believe the iPad 4 has the highest current draw of all of the devices.  I have noted a 200mV drop in output voltage at approximately 2A load.  That of course is undesirable but within spec.  I spent to many years in power supply development to completely ignore that but also except it.  I think this product should meet the requirements of most users both for home and travel.  I recommend both the product and the brand.",1.0

"This was very easy to mount to my TV. It comes with 3 different ways to mount (on the wall, on the TV with adhesive, and on the TV with clips). I mounted it on my TV with the clips and it works much better than it did sitting on/in my TV stand. The remote signal is much better. I no longer have to aim the remote right at the Roku. I also did not want to use adhesive or screw into a wall, so the clip option was the selling point for me. I recommend this product.",1.0

"Does exactly what I needed it to! I have an older Infocus projector which is not HDMI capable. I initially connected the projector to my DirecTV receiver, and received the error regarding HDCP issues and was stumped on how to bypass it. I searched around online and was led to this powered HDMI splitter. After reading some mixed reviews about whether or not it would work for bypassing HDCP with DirecTV boxes, I gambled and ordered it. As soon as it arrived today, I went and connected it to the DirecTV receiver, then to my projector via a HDMI to VGA adapter and I now have a working projector again! I also was able to run it through my receiver which is HDMI capable, and then out to the projector using the same HDMI to VGA connection and it works like that also! I am so excited and relieved that all I need was this splitter!",1.0

This was a great buy, once again, from Amazon and I will be buying again in the future.",1.0
"Really pleased with the ear cups. Has totally change all aspects of the headphones. For me, there has been an improvement in the upper frequencies, but most dramatically has really opened up the soundstage. Sounds totally different to what I had before.

And at a price much less than genuine replacement cups, these items are probably one of the cheapest ways to improve the performance of your headphones. Love em.",1.0

"These are amazing. I have always loved the portability and bass of my skull candy earbuds when you get a good seal but I have trouble getting the right fit. with the rubber tips it seems like the only way to get them to not fall out, while also getting good bass is too jam them into your ear pretty good and at that point, you have pushed out all the air and can feel almost like a suction that is putting tension of your eardrum. Not with these! I read about these while looking at the reviews for the Jaybirds Blue Buds X, I ended up ordering them along with a set of these, I can't tell you how happy I am with the setup. I don't even use the little wing tips or whatever you want to call them. roll these just like a normal foam earplug, and quickly place in a comfortable spot in your ear, hold for around 5-10 seconds and listen to your music. The highs are good and mids are good, and with the perfect seal you get with these foam ear tips, you get great heavy bass. but it is CLEAN. its not muddy, exaggerated, it is very present but in the cleanest way possible. Get the right fit and then head bang for an hour and I would be surprised if you managed to get them to fall out.",1.0
"Best choice out of the varying options we were given by so-called experts. We chose this and my in-house geek is the happiest.

"We have been able to receive 19 channels with this antenna.  The installation was easy and we have it mounted on an interior wall. We live in a wooded area at the bottom of a hill but near the city so I was unsure the type of reception we'd receive. However, the reception is great...unless the weather is poor...  Only downside is the adhesive strips provided with the product aren't strong enough to hold it to the wall. You'll either need to nail it or add more strips. overall, perfectly pleased though!",1.0

"Excellent little Bluetooth speaker. Bought at Costco and am amazed at this bargain. No nonsense loud voices telling if you're connected or not (finally!!) and the sound is outstanding considering the size of this item. I use it mainly in my car to listen to lectures and occasionally some music too. One thing that could be improved is the loudness although as is it fits the bill quite well. Where this thing impressed me the most though, is with its outstanding speakerphone capability. Not one complain yet from anyone I've spoken to through this little gizmo and that for me was a real deciding factor as tons of little BT speakers have as loud or louder a sound, long lasting battery, yadi yada...but their speakerphone in general mostly stink at best...this guy however pulls it off nearly as well as my way more expensive Sony SRS X3!!<br />Cool design and colors BTW. Battery lasts quite many hours. Have not timed it but 6-7 hours minimum I'd say.<br />Charges pretty fast too.<br />READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!!! Most reviewers are complaining about loosing the BT connection settings after turning it off. Some even mention the ridiculously long time it takes to shut it down lol.<br />Once paired if you click the on/off button just once for a short second OR LESS the speaker will alternate between the on and off mode and go in standby mode. If you hold the button for a few seconds then a complete shutdown happens and therefore the connection settings may be lost. This in fact is a very welcome and refreshing function (like my Sony SRS X3) as holding the button down for a stupid amount of time is what's required on most low to mid end BT speakers and I personally can't stand it. It's unnecessary and annoying. This one, one quick click it's off, one quick click and it's on... And remember, NO annoying voices either....I love that! Essentially a very well engineered piece of electronics. Btw it does mentioned being engineers in the USA and made in China. I'm not surprised by the results especially the speakerphone function (can't stress its usefulness enough).<br />Anyways, read the instructions and enjoy this remarkable and recommendable BT speaker.<br />I'm probably gonna purchase a couple more for the price they sell.<br />I absolutely and easily recommend this item.",1.0

One older Kindle was having charging problems which were not helped using two of the chargers I already had, so I thought for sure that that the Kindle battery was at fault, and that would be the end of that. But no! The first of these RAPID power chargers that I bought charged what I believed was a dying Kindle very, very quickly!  Yahoo!! So within a week or so I purchased another charger as a spare. I also like the 6.5 foot cord, which makes it easier to just plug it in, while continuing to use your device. Highly recommend!",1.0

It is not clear whether the battery can be replaced - perhaps by unscrewing the cover on the speaker. There is no indicator on the speaker of how much battery life is left. But an interesting feature is that next to the bluetooth icon on my iPhone/iPad there is a battery charge level indicator for the speaker. Advertised play time is pretty long but I did not verify.<br /><br />The speaker uses the newer Bluetooth 4 standard. Volume changes on device and speaker are in sync, which is a lot more convenient. However, the volume buttons do not have a second function to skip forward/backward like they have on<br />Taotronics other models.<br /><br />You can pair more than one Bluetooth device with the speakers. However, the manual does not list how many devices can be paired with speaker.<br /><br />The bluetooth range is great and covers at least 30ft plus. Keep in mind that this is a Mono speaker. I would not call this speaker bidirectional since most of the sound is coming out the front. I believe the Bass is supposed to come out of the back Sound is a bit thin but quite acceptable for a speaker of this size and prize, and definitely loud enough across the room.<br /><br />The speaker has a microphone and can therefore be used as a speaker phone. The speaker plays the ring tone of your phone. A conversation on the phone was loud and clear and the microphone worked fine.<br /><br />The speaker can be put on a flat surface, has a large rubber handle and a tripod screw underneath. The rubberized covering looks strong and sturdy. I did not test how waterproof the speaker is.<br /><br />Overall a great outdoor speaker, great packaging, easy to read manual with clear contact information. A suggestion would be to include a travel pouch since you may want to throw this speaker in a beach bag or hiking backpack.",1.0

"It works!  We recently bought a Samsung Blu-Ray player as a gift for my son-in-law and his sweetie.  Their flat screen had so-so built-in speakers and their old skool receiver had no HDMI inputs, just stereo RCA analog audio inputs.  I purchased this unit and ALSO purchased this cable [[ASIN:B0002J2B8I C2G / Cables To Go 29115 Velocity S/PDIF Digital Audio Coax Cable (6 Feet)]] .  When we hooked it up it immediately worked.  Audio content from movies sounds good, clear.  Sound is in sync with the picture.  Now their setup has some real bass and oomph.  This will be a solution for them until they can afford a modern 7.1 surround receiver/speaker setup.  Note:  We went into the Blu-Ray player's audio settings and confirmed that PCM was set as the default.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - CAVEATS, TECHNICAL ADVICE:  Caveat 1:  This only produces stereo output (Left and Right analog audio jacks).  In the setting of your Blu-Ray player:  You ** have ** to use PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) output setting if you want this to work right  -- it specifies that right on the box.  Now, some people may have an older receiver that would have a feature to synthesize surround for a 5.1 system but usually, if you have that feature available to you, then one would &#34;tend to&#34; also have HDMI inputs on their receiver.  If you have HDMI inputs on your audio receiver... why bother?  This is a work around for those who don't.  IF your receiver has HDMI inputs, the high likelihood is that you don't need this.  IF your receiver has HDMI inputs and you aren't getting audio output 1. Check your settings and the sequence in which you turn components on  (I find that turning on my plasma TV before turning on my receiver works better).  2.  You might need to find an HDMI cable that specifies it has &#34;audio return&#34;.  All that being said, if you need this kind of workaround solution to deliver an analog feed an older sound system, then  ---&#62; running your Blu-Ray player's sound output through a decent stereo's analog inputs using this interface conversion box beats the pants off using the the wimpy speakers in most TVs.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Caveat 2:  OREI DOES ** NOT ** GIVE YOU A NON-OPTICAL (i.e. copper wire) CABLE ...which I believe will be the solution most people actually want.  YOU HAVE TO PURCHASE ONE SEPARATELY.  I strongly recommend buying a specifically &#34;Digital&#34; cable, labeled as being meant for SPDIF (Sony/Panasonic Digital Interface) like in the link I mentioned above - they run 5 - 10 dollars.  If you try using a conventional RCA analog audio cable the digital signal may corrupt or the sound could stutter, especially over longer cable lengths.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  Caveat 3:  I suppose there may be some Blu-Ray players out there that, for cost cutting purposes, have omitted the SPDIF connector that looks like a single RCA jack.  In which case this product would not be a solution you could use.  Final note:  This unit also comes with an optical connector interface and a probably 3 ft optical cable.  I did not use that feature or test it so cannot speak to how well it works.  You * could * run the blu-ray player's HDMI cable to your flat screen and then, IF it had an optical out, use the supplied optical cable to this OREI box and then run RCA analog cables to your stereo.  The big unknown is:  Will the audio output &#34;lag&#34; or stay in sync with your TV?  Sometimes you can set video / sound delay in your TV.  You'd just have to test.  Again, if your receiver has HDMI built in, there is usually no need to use this kind of product.",1.0

"I used this mount to install an older, and heavier, Toshiba 37&#34; LCD TV in my home tiki bar.  The mount was inexpensive, easy to install and it's well made especially at this price point.  I liked the fact that it would adjust upwards from a 20&#34; ceiling to mount measurement.  I needed the 20&#34; mount measurement.  Yes, the allen screw that holds the swivel mount would eventually keep loosening if the television is swiveled frequently but there's a long enough bolt that it won't happen overnight.  We won't be swiveling the tv much so I have no concerns.  Overall it's a great value.",1.0

"I received this cable on August 25, 2015.  I had purchased it for use in a hifi system along with a Wharfedale 8&#34; subwoofer.  I had read good things, but I was still surprised by the quality of this cable when it arrived.  I also use BlueRigger HDMI cables, and I am very happy with those, so I bought this as well.  It is a very thick, dual shielded cable, and the ends are gold plated and fit snugly with no play.  It was exactly what I needed.  Bass was crisp and clear, no hum or interference.  I ended up replacing this with a MediaBridge cable because I discovered that if I used a cable with a split mono lead, I could get a bit more input level and a noticeable gain in output.  I wish that BlueRigger made a split mono version.  I briefly considered buying a small splitter adapter and a second one of these because of how nice it is, but the cost would have been too high.  If your subwoofer uses a crossover that only requires a single RCA connection, then this is the cable to get.  If you can get a bit more level using a splitter, or a split mono cable, then go that route because there is a noticeable difference.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Thick, high quality cable<br />-Gold plated ends<br />-Snug fitting<br />-No hum or interference (dual shielded)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Not offered in a split mono version<br /><br />All in all, I will be using more BlueRigger products in the future and I look forward to seeing their line expand. I rate this cable at 5/5 stars and highly recommend BlueRigger products.  For the cost vs. quality this is easily one of the best brands on Amazon.",1.0

"I originally wanted a music player that was cheap and had a vast expandable memory slot for just listening to music on-the-go. Though, it seemed like I would have to sacrifice one or the other, I was going to get an unlocked smart phone until I came across this guy. It's not perfect, however, I rate it 5 stars for what you get for $100. Don't be fooled either, It is an amazing player that I believe is more favorable over an iPod Classic and other expensive Hi-Res Players.<br />At first glance, It looks like a knock-off of a smaller version of an iPod Classic which greets you with an expeditious boot-up and on to the main screen that will throw you off a bit. It's easy to navigate using the mechanical jog wheel which feels sturdy and has minimal leeway. The settings are simple to understand and has tech manual included if you decide you need to use it after you've thrown it out. The chassis feels solid even with the plastic back panel and comes with a silicone case too if you're feeling skeptical. The battery is long lasting (approximately 11 hours) and has a micro USB jack to charge it.<br />There are two types of ways to view your music: File Mode and Category Mode. In File Mode, It will appear exactly how you arrange your files or music on your removable drive window on your computer which allows users to customize and organize their music listings, for example, I sorted my music by Artist &#62; Album &#62; Songs. This will require some time and can be fixed by updating your files in settings which will automatically designate your music based on the files' detailed information under Category Mode. The only drawback to Category Mode, which I believe is the only major drawback, is that you can only store 5800 songs in Category Mode yet you can have as many songs as your MicroSD card can fit under File Mode.<br />Some of the user interface abilities could have been improved but unfortunately, Fiio has stopped making updates for the X1 and will soon be replaced by the X3 Next Generation. All in all, this player has exceeded my expectation and I will try out some lose-less music to see the true potential of the X1.",1.0

"[[ASIN:B003EM800S Panasonic RPHJE120S In-Ear Headphone, Silver]]<br /><br />I have been using these Panasonics for over a year now.  For me, they are still the biggest bang for the buck.  I thought I lost my last pair so I decided to &#34;splurge&#34; and pay twice the price for these SoundMAGICs as I heard great things.  There are reviews that specifically compares my Panasonics to the ES18s where great majority states that ES18s are the clear winner.<br /><br />For me, however, it isn't all that clear.  Perhaps from sound quality alone that may be the case but the nominal gains you get in sound quality can be negated by some of the other factors that I considered.<br /><br />I found my set of Panasonics after I received the ES18 which allowed me to conduct a side by side comparison. Some notes about the comparison:<br />- I am not an audiophile but I do appreciate a good set of headphones.  Let's just say that I'm willing to pay up to $20 for a good set.<br />- Used the ES18 for a few days before comparing to allow burn in period (~60 hrs).<br />- Same music and videos were used on iPad Mini and iPhone 5.  I switched the two earphones back and forth between the two devices to make sure that there wasn't a sound difference from device source.  There wasn't.  I had one set in one ear and the other set in other ear at the same time (but this actually made it harder to tell the difference between the two).<br /><br />What I found in order of personal importance:<br /><br />Sound quality winner: SoundMAGIC ES18<br />Both delivers good bass for such affordable sets.  Online sources say the ES18's bass is superior.  I couldn't tell and must call that a draw.  The lowest lows from both sets seemed near equal.  Both had that headbobbing thump that makes listening to them enjoyable.  Where the ES18 wins is the mid's.  My slight criticism of the Panasonics is that the mid's do seem a bit flat making the ES18 seem more balanced.  I can also hear more detail in the ES18.  And because the more balanced approach, voice clarity is better on the ES18 also.  At first I thought that the Panasonics had better bass but it's because it seems to &#34;push&#34; the lows (making the lower range louder) but in reality the absolute lows of both sets were fairly, and near equally, deep.  Some may prefer the Panasonic's over-emphasis on the low end.  So the ES18 has better sound because of the balance, more mid, overall detail and voice clarity.  How much more did I enjoy the ES18 in terms of sound quality?  In a completely subjective term: a little.  Yes, there is a clear difference on HOW they sound but it took me a couple hours of going back and forth to ultimately say I ENJOY the sound of ES18 more.<br /><br />Comfort and design winner:  Panasonic RPHJE120<br />This one was absolutely clear to me as soon as I put on the ES18.  The Panasonic's &#34;Ergo-fit&#34; design has the offset ear insert and a flat surface to lay in the flat spot next to the ear hole.  Not only does the Ergo-fit design make it more comfy, it allows a more secure fit.  The ear insert itself on the Panasonics is smaller probably due to the smaller driver size (9mm vs. 10mm).  While neither are heavy, you can tell the weight of the ES18 is higher (again, probably due to the larger driver size).  Also, the Panasonic's shape doesn't protrude out of the ear as much as the ES18.  You could almost side sleep with the Panasonics on.<br /><br />Other design consideration is the discerning between the left and and the right insert.  The Panasonic's design is distinct to which ear insert belongs to which side of the ear (due to the flat surface as part of the Ergo-fit design).  You'll be able to understand and see from a distance which insert belongs to which ear within seconds of ownership.  The ES18, on the other hand, is symmetric in design.  There is a tiny little &#34;R&#34; at the cord stem for the right side but it's impossible to see in low lighting.  I now go by the &#34;ES18&#34; written on the right insert.  The left side does not have a &#34;L&#34; but I know now that the left insert has SoundMAGIC's insignia on that side.  The point is, you can tell the left and right on the Panny's easily but you'll have see up close to discern on the ES18.<br /><br />Cord material winner:  SoundMAGIC ES18<br />Another no brainer.  The Panny's thin cord allows it to get tangled easily.  I like the heft that the ES18's cord has that resist tangling.  I'm spending anywhere between 10 seconds to a minute untangling or unknotting the Panny's cord everytime I take it out of my gym bag.  Haven't done once with ES18.  While this may not seem like a big deal, I've had more &#34;Not again!&#34; moments when I took the Panasonics out of my bag than I'd care for.<br /><br />Cost winner:  Panasonic RPHJE120<br />At around six bucks, less than half price of the ES18.<br /><br />To say which I like more is tough to answer when you factor in cost and comfort.  I give both 5 stars.  Yes I do think the ES18 sounds better but I still quite enjoy the Panasonic's sound.  What you get for the money on either is extraordinary.  Those that appreciate a balanced approach and have a more critical ear should look into the ES18.  Those that just want something better than the cruddy stock earbuds that came with your mobile device can't go wrong with the $6 Panasonics.<br /><br />UPDATE 10/1/15:<br />There is an L indicating the left ear piece.  I missed that initially.  Just proves how hard it is to see the L and R indicators.  I placed a little strip of red tape on the right ear piece so I can easily tell the difference.<br /><br />I find myself reaching for the ES18 over the Panasonics when side-by-side as I do enjoy the sound of these more when I want to rock out. The bass has a better impact as you can hear both the sub-bass and mid-bass while the Panny's bass seem blended together.  The sound stage is another significant difference where the ES18 sound much more open.  The Panny's sound like listening to loud speakers in a small enclosed room compared to these.  There's so much debate in the online universe about which value IEMs have the best sound stage presentation (i.e. Brainwavz Delta and now Jive, Xiaomi Pistons, Phillips SHE3590, SoundSoul products, MEE products) but I think these ES18's do a very good job and, generally in the online community, are well regarded.  Man, I'm still dizzy from trying to decipher online what is the best value IEM.  There's so many out there in the $5-$25 range that's rated well.  I guess that's a win for us value consumers.  The biggest concensus knock against the ES18 I found online is that the treble is rolled off and lacks the sizzle that some prefer.  I'm ok with it as I don't want anything piercing.<br /><br />My biggest personal gripe is that the bass is nonexistent at moderate to low volume so I do prefer the Panny's when I'm in a mellow mood.  The Panny's still have a good thump at lower volumes.  The ES18's bass presence is hugely dependent on volume and without that presence, it completely lacks depth.  I didn't see many complaints about this online so I'm wondering if it's an issue with my set or am I the only one who cares?  I'm going to assume the latter as the set works just fine otherwise.  And because of the bass-volume dependency, the ES18's lose versatility.  I'm one of those that listen to all kinds of music so the lack of versatility is somewhat disappointing.  I'm glad to have both in the end.  I'll probably use these 4 of 5 times and use the Panny's for the remainder for sit down listening.  It's Panny's all the way for working out due to the more comfortable and secure fit.<br /><br />Added note:  I'm now a proud owner of the Panasonic TCM125's (down to $9 here on Amazon!), the RPHJE120 equivalent with mic and remote.  Gave the 120's to the GF who lost her stock buds.  Now I can answer calls during workout without having to pull phone out of pocket.  Some say the 125's soundbetter and some say the 120's sound better (CNET says latter).  I went back and forth after burning in the 125's.  I cannot tell a difference.  To me it's the same darn thing; it's just a matter of paying extra $3 to get the mic/remote.<br /><br />One thing I will say is that both Panny's can get much louder than the ES18.  It may be a matter of impedence and/or sensitivity.  I think the highest volume for the ES18 will be more than enough for the average listener but not for those that want it super loud.s have the best sound stage presentation (i.e. Brainwavz Delta and now Jive, Xiaomi Pistons, Phillips SHE3590, SoundSoul products, MEE products) but I think these ES18's do a very good job and, generally in the online community, are well regarded.  Man, I'm still dizzy from trying to decipher online what is the best value IEM.  There's so many out there in the $5-$25 range that's rated well.  I guess that's a win for us value consumers.  The biggest concensus knock against the ES18 I found online is that the treble is rolled off and lacks the sizzle that some prefer.  I'm ok with it as I don't want anything piercing.    My biggest personal gripe is that the bass is nonexistent at moderate to low volume so I do prefer the Panny's when I'm in a mellow mood.  The Panny's still have a good thump at lower volumes.  The ES18's bass presence is hugely dependent on volume and without that presence, it completely lacks depth.  I didn't see many complaints about this online so I'm wondering if it's an issue with my set or am I the only one who cares?  I'm going to assume the latter as the set works just fine otherwise.  And because of the bass-volume dependency, the ES18's lose versatility.  I'm one of those that listen to all kinds of music so the lack of versatility is somewhat disappointing.  I'm glad to have both in the end.  I'll probably use these 4 of 5 times and use the Panny's for the remainder for sit down listening.  It's Panny's all the way for working out due to the more comfortable and secure fit.    Added note:  I'm now a proud owner of the Panasonic TCM125's (down to $9 here on Amazon!), the RPHJE120 equivalent with mic and remote.  Gave the 120's to the GF who lost her stock buds.  Now I can answer calls during workout without having to pull phone out of pocket.  Some say the 125's sound better and some say the 120's sound better (CNET says latter).  I went back and forth after burning in the 125's.  I cannot tell a difference.  To me it's the same darn thing; it's just a matter of paying extra $3 to get the mic/remote.  One thing I will say is that both Panny's can get much louder than the ES18.  It may be a matter of impedence and/or sensitivity.  I think the highest volume for the ES18 will be more than enough for the average listener but not for those that want it super loud.",1.0

"I'm upgrading from a Yamaha Aventage 2000 receiver which still works great.  I decided to upgrade because I wanted a receiver that does Dolby Atmos and DTS:X and also has HDMI 2.0a: and HDCP 2.2 support.  There have been many improvements over the last five years which have been incorporated into the receiver.  (Too many to mention.)  It plays louder, has a smoother, more balanced sound, and seems to run cooler than my old unit.  It took about thirty minutes to get everything set up including a basic calibration.  ( I'm coming from a previous Yamaha receiver so I knew what to expect, but the quick set-up guide makes it pretty simple to get started for people not used to the Yamaha brand.)  Forgot to add :  The standard antennae-connected radio works great.  (Something my previous Yamaha 2000 did poorly.)  The Internet radio is also performing superbly.",1.0

"These are great headphones, I did a lot of searching and even sent back some Seinheisers that didn't have what I was looking for. Let me make one thing clear, the quality of this headphone can be replicated by cheaper headphones, BUT... not if you amp them. I went 2 months without an amp and they were great, dug real low on movies with bass and, well there are other reviews about the awesome sound but frankly it's a flat EQ (which was done on purpose and is a good thing) but I bought them for their bass capabilities not for their ability to replicate audio without 'tarnishing' it. I used a Fiio E17k and these things WOKE UP. You can adjust the bass, treble, and whatnot to remain flat and even then these things sound better. Add +4 or +6 to the bass EQ though and these are FUN.<br />  Some people mention that when you get high end headphones like these and an amp it just makes bad music stick out more, it is unfortunately very true. I can immediately tell which tracks on my ipod or on Youtube were downloaded at low quality, it's painful to listen to... but it's completely worth it when you find good HQ tracks because these babies put you in the studio. Bass guitars have concert like depth, highs are not shrill, the amp completely brings back the mids that some people have complained about not being up to par, and if you throw on techno/trap/rap ... if you're into that sort of thing... the D600s are thrilling. ss...<br />  Long story short, these are great by themselves, but if you want to actually experience them the way they are meant to be experienced, and have some hard hitting (not distorted or overbearing) bass- GET THEM with an AMP!!!!<br />Sidenote, I almost didn't buy these because of a negative review about the headband being uncomfortable, but I have a buzzcut, a normal sized/shaped head ( I think ) and I have these on for hours at a time with no trouble. They are in fact extremely comfortable and I've never had to take them off out of annoyance.",1.0

"Last year, I finally transitioned to a flat screen TV.  It wasn't new, but it was new to me.  Until then, I wasn't really sure what all of the whole HDMI thing was about.  It just looks like a fatter USB plug if you don't have HDMI.  Imagine my surprise when my older electronics also needed to be replaced with newer ones and they all required or suggested an HDMI connection.  That's great, if your TV has more than one HDMI port!<br /><br />My older TV works beautifully, so I couldn't justify buying another TV just to get more HDMI ports.  After looking around, I found several brands of multi-port HDMI plug and play units.  I decided on the HausBell 3-Port High Speed HDMI Switch 3-In-1-Out (Hdmi V1.3) Intelligent 1080P AC Power adapter.<br /><br />I was nervous about setting this up, but it was easy and fast.  It literally took about 2 minutes from the time I took it out of the package until I was watching TV using the HausBell 3-Port High Speed HDMI Switch 3-In-1-Out Intelligent 1080P AC Power adapter.  I plugged my Apple TV into the adapter and the adapter into the back of my TV.  I switched the TV and Apple TV back on but the Apple TV didn't switch on.  I moved the Apple TV to the second port on the adapter and it was fully functional.<br /><br />The picture quality is as good as it was when I had the Apple TV connected directly to the TV.  I may now brave up and hook up the DVD player next.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided with a free or discounted product in order to review this item. However, this did not influence my review. All opinions are true and my own.",1.0

The Onh HDTV Indoor Antenna works great. I purchased this in conjunction with the Onh Low Noise HDTV Antenna Amplifier Signal High Gain Booster. The combination is bringing me 49 channels with excellent picture and sound quality.  We are located 35 to 40 miles from the broadcast towers. The antenna is mounted in a window at about six feet above the floor. We use a splitter to connect two TVs to the one antenna with no loss of picture integrity.

"The Sangean ANT-60 antenna is good for what it is and performs as it should. One came packed with my excellent Sangean ATS-909X multiband radio. What is it? ANT-60 is a 23' random wire antenna that reels into a spool like a measuring tape. That makes it easy to pack and carry around. It has a 3.5mm plug that fits into the external antenna socket on many portable shortwave radios. This plug is the same as a 1/8&#34; mono audio plug available as an electronics part from electronics stores like Radio Shack. The ANT-60 includes an alligator clip adaptor that allows the user to connect the ANT-60 center plug pin to the whip antenna of radios that do not feature an external 3.5mm-1/8&#34;antenna jack. ANT-60 also includes a strap and clip for hanging the far end of the antenna. ANT-60 is nice as a portable antenna for temporary setups. I pack mine when traveling or when using the radio on the boat.  A random wire antenna will provide useful signal gain over a built-in telescopic whip SW antenna if the wire is long enough for the frequency to be received. The ANT-60 is long enough to provide excellent gain for SW frequencies over 12.0 MHz. For frequencies lower than that don't expect quite as much gain. For an example from my location nnear the US west coast, Radio Australia at 17.840 MHz late afternoons and evenings comes in two or three times stronger with ANT-60 compared to using the built-in whip antenna on the Sangean ATS-909X. But, listening to Radio Havana Cuba during the evening at the lower frequency of 6.100 MHz may only be 50% to two times stronger with ANT-60 compared to the whip antenna. The ANT-60 doesn't do quite as well at lower frequencies due to it's relatively short length. The built-in ferrite bar antennas found on most multi-band portables will do a better job for AM band (MW) radio which is much lower in frequency than SW. ANT-60 works best with SW.   The ANT-60 antenna should be hung horizontally and as high off the ground as convenient. Six to eightfeet off the ground will do fine. The direction isn't that critical at this low height off the ground. No need to string it up tightly, a little sag in the wire won't hurt. Random wire antennas work best if you use them outdoors. They can work well inside wooden framed houses. You can also use a random wire antenna indoors by running most of the wire outdoors through a window or doorway.  ANT-60 may be purchased for under $15 and sometimes for under $10. Keep in mind that for $25 you can buy 75' or more of 18 gauge insulated copper wire, a 1/8&#34; mono audio plug and some mounting hardware and have a permanent random wire antenna that will run circles around the ANT-60 at all SW frequencies down to 3.0 MHz and maybe below that. I use a 120' random wire at home mounted eight feet off the ground. That antenna rocks.  Keep in mind that quite a few user/reviewers and blog reviewers of short wave gear do not understand shortwave radio very well. SW reception is always better with outdoor antennas. Areas located in &#34;the boonies&#34; often offer the best reception of all because they are located away from electronic devices that cause RFI (radio frequency interference) with shortwave receivers. Those new to shortwave may also not understand that certain times of day offer better shortwave reception than others and that most shortwave bands work better at certain times of day than others. Inexpensive portable shortwave radios priced under $150 are likely to offer performance that is limited, at best. Cheap radios often rely too much on amplified antenna gain from a whip antenna and may overload if a longer external antenna like ANT-60 is attached.  For well-designed shortwave radios (portable or tabletop) the ANT-60 will work better than a built-in whip antenna. The reel-up feature is a nice convenience.",1.0

"Works better than I could've hoped for. If you didn't know the signal was split, this box won't tip you off.",1.0
Great cable. Fits my HD598s perfectly and the red cable with black sleeving matches the brown on the headset much better than the black cable that came with the headphones. The included 1/4&#34; screw-on adapter is very high quality and the spring-style is a unique touch that matches the connectors very well. Definitely a great upgrade if you want something that looks or feels different from the stock cable or need a replacement cable.<br /><br />This cable is the perfect length to listen to music with my phone in my pocket and not have a ton of extra cable spilling out of my pockets like spaghetti.,1.0
"I've owned 3 different types of Bose in-ear headphones, ranging in price from 100.00 to $150.00, I love everything Bose, but I'm hear to tell you, these Zipbuds are all you'll ever need. And they're 35 bucks. My challenge to the brand shoppers like me, the next time your 100.00 plus headphones go down, do yourself a favor and try these. They fit well, they really are &#34;no tangle&#34;, the zip concept is great, and of course the most important part, the sound... the dynamics are very good. The base thumps, and honestly, the mid range to highs are better than the Bose. Heck I can get 3 pairs of these and get change back or 1 pair of the Bose. Now that I know how good they are, I'll probably get another color too. FOLKS, TRY THESE HEADPHONES. You can pay more, but you'll be hard pressed to get a better headphone.",1.0
"We purchased this speaker because of it's small size, relatively small price, and positive reviews. We wanted to listen to music in the backyard while cleaning up or gardening and wanted something that was durable, portable, and water resistant. This met our needs and then some. We have used it outdoors while barbecuing and indoors while cooking and cleaning and it is great not worrying about cords. It just syncs with the phone and music plays. Simple.",1.0

"This system works great! It sounds awesome outside for a cookout, or inside for a party or enjoying some music in the kitchen. It plays really loud, but the sound is great quality. The remote is very convenient and I have had no problems at all with this system. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a system that isn't too high-tech, it doesn't have any extra speakers or wires. You can plug any phone into the back with an audio wire so that it can play from anything with a headphone jack.",1.0
Awesome deal...USB port permits flash drive operation for audio files.,1.0
Works great!! It really exceeded my expectations.,1.0
"I have a large house (7000sqft) , and I can hook these headphones to my iPhone, and walk anywhere on the same floor and not lose connection. I just bought these for running/skating/biking but they have turned into an everyday thing. The sound is so great, I don't even want to listen to my iPhone anymore through just the iPhone speakers. I was also a staunch supporter of &#34;in the ear&#34; headphones, as I thought these would slip off, or not fit my skinny face. Also not the case! I wear glasses (size 49 if you wear glasses you know it's skinny:)),  and they go together fine, no issues there either. Great buy, so happy!",1.0

"I am a professional installer of audio video equipment and I am thoroughly impressed with this mount. It is my first time purchasing from Echo Gear, and it will certainly not be my last. This mount is built to survive world war 3. On an installation scale, I would not recommend anyone without solid mechanical knowledge to get this thing mounted to the wall however, because it does have some weight to it. This is meant for someone who wants it done right. Cheers EchoGear, thank you for an excellent product.<br /><br />Daniel Zuzevich<br />President<br />Intelligent Electrical Systems<br />www.iesystemscorp.com",1.0
"Cable looks, works, and functions great.  It's a little stiff though.  I knew going in that it would be more stiff being braided cables, but it is quite a bit more stiff than I anticipated, which is mainly an issue behind the TV where I want to make a couple bends to keep the wire hidden.  I will eventually put HDMI through my walls and just use this as a spare long cable as needed for connecting a laptop, setting a TV outside, and other temporary uses.<br /><br />UPDATE - I increased my review from 4 to 5 stars because really the cables are great and very rugged, which is why they may not be as flexible as other cables.  Also after leaving a nice professional review I was contacted by the company to thank me for the review and I really like to see a company go that extra mile and listen to the feedback they are getting.  That in itself would be worth a 6/5 star rating if I could.",1.0
Seems to work well. Only used it once on my cruise but it performed well.,1.0

"Not much to be said about this extension cord other than it uses sturdy, quality connectors. Only problem for me: I was looking for an extension cord with a very thin plug that would fit through the tight opening of a phone battery case, and I was hoping this one would -- it doesn't, even after removing the screwed-in plug cover. Since it's not advertised as such, I see no reason to lower the rating of an otherwise good cable, but in case you're looking for a headphone cord that can replace the pigtail that came with a phone battery case, this is not it.",1.0
Everything on this order was fine. I got a great product at a great price. Well packaged and fast shipment. My Mother Loves it,1.0
These work great for storing photo CDs at the back of my scrapbooks. The backing is easy to peel off and the adhesive sticks well to the surface but doesn't grab on so quickly that you have to be quick to position it. I had hoped to find a bundle of 50 but it was worth getting the 100 pcs because they work exactly how I had hoped.,1.0
"Just as the title states, this is an awesome wireless speaker! This product is tinier than expected and measures 2.5&#34; wide by 2&#34; tall. Here are the features this speaker can do below. This product also contains a charging/Line-in cord and a handy little velvet bag for safe traveling.<br /><br />* Bluetooth pairing to listen to music (Both Pandora and Spotify worked flawless for me, as well as music downloaded onto my phone)<br />* Hands Free calling via Bluetooth<br />* Play music via the microSD card (Supports up to 64GB)<br />* FM Tuner (Another feature that worked perfect for me)<br />* Music via Line-in mode<br />* NFC pairing (Didn't work for me, see below)<br /><br />These are a ton of features that are available for this speaker. Everything worked well beyond my expectation minus the NFC pairing. For some reason, I couldn't pair my phone to the speaker using NFC. It could have been the phone case I'm using, but I didn't make too much effort to try and get it working. I prefer bluetooth over NFC anyways, so this wasn't a big deal. I'm confident if I contacted the support people, they could have fixed my problem.<br /><br />Some other cool features I like are the semi-sticky surface on the bottom of the speaker. This will definitely help against slipping away. Also, I like the way the volume/tuner work.  A quick press to the left/right will change the FM station, Pandora song, (or other streaming song), while a long press will lower the volume.<br /><br />Overall, this wireless speaker is one of the best speakers I've bought. Don't let it's small size deter you. The sound quality is way much better than I expected. What are you waiting for? If you're looking for a small and amazing wireless speaker, I highly recommend this one!<br /><br />Although I didn't use it, NUVUO seems to have a great return policy: We pride ourselves with our Guaranteed 100% Customer Satisfaction.

"I was skeptical of the quality when initially purchasing the unit based on the many features and the low price point, but was surprisingly very impressed! All functions work great as intended. The main reason I bought this unit for was the turntable feature so i could once again dust off my old vinyl that's been taking up space in my attic. I feel like the majority of time with &#34;swiss army&#34; type _-in-1 units, the individual product feature quality is sacrificed for a larger quantity of features. This was not the case with the IT Nostalgic Classic 6-In-1. The turntable works great as well as the five other featured functions. I am very impressed with the bluetooth feature. Originally when purchasing, I figured this would be overkill and would never get used. Boy was i wrong! I am able to connect my iPhone via bluetooth without a hitch and now use the function almost as much as the turntable! The sound quality is good, not great, but quite better than what i was expecting. You wont need an ear trumpet to listen to the device from your couch but you wont have the police knocking on your door with a noise complaint either. The classic style of the device also ties in well with my home decor. It does not look out of place like other modern technological devices would. Overall, I am very impressed and would recommend!",1.0

"These plugs work very well for the price. I am no audiophile but I do like to get the most of my entertainment system. Up until buying these, I was simply screwing the wires directly to the back of my receiver.

I was able to notice a slight but real difference in my speaker output once these were installed.",1.0

"This is a nice mount.  The instructions could be a little clearer for mounting the extension arms to the main plate, but for the price I wasn't expecting too much.  For the price, the included level and HDMI cables were a nice touch.  I'm using this mount for a Sony KDL46EX500, and it is holding very solidly.",1.0
"I'm very happy with this purchase. I read a lot of reviews on these before making my decision, and I decided to go with this option for future expandability. Set up was great, and really easy, and it works well with all of my devices. I've only been using it for about 2 weeks now, but I haven't had any issues. The only thing that I would point out is that when I was going through the setup process, the onscreen guide would go completely blank after a certain amount of time. I'm not sure if it was because of the receiver or my TV, but hitting the input button on the remote would make it pop back up.",1.0

"Apparently our daughter is going through some sort of deaf-wish phase. Listening to music or the TV or really anything that she's interested in must be cranked to 11 for her to be happy or she complains &#34;I can't HEAR!&#34; (we've had her hearing tested- it's fine, for real!). So when we were going on a road-trip I was hesitant to buy headphones so she could listen to What Does the Fox Say on repeat for 10 hours at a time without my sanity going out the window because I was sure she would end up damaging her hearing for good.<br /><br />Enter these headphones... with awesome volume limiting abilities! To add to their allure for her, they were PINK! So we were both happy. She got to listen to her favorite songs of all time, and I got to know that she wasn't going to end up with hearing aides at the ripe old age of 10 (plus, no Ylvis for me!)",1.0

"I've only just installed it. So far, compared to the Clear Stream 2 we were using, we get a lot better signal reception. Several channels that used to pixelate and break up badly with the Clear Stream antenna now come in very strong. We are about 54 miles from the signal sources. We'll have to keep an eye on it and see how it works during different weather conditions. So far I am very happy with this product",1.0

I don't watch much TV but I do like to watch football on Sunday. I got the new 60 mile-15 db version of this one and it picked up 68 channels! I only need 5 to watch Sunday football. Granted I'll miss the games on ESPN but those few games are not worth the hundreds of dollars a year for cable. Super clear picture-looks almost HD. Easy hookup took 5 min. Combine this with Roku and Netflix and you have more than enough to watch.,1.0
"These are fantastic for motorcycle riding. Yeah, yeah, I know. Dangerous! Just like cranking a stereo in a car to me, but the point is they block most of the wind and you can hear the music at any speed without blaring it. My last pair that were good I had to have the volume almost maxed. With these I have it less than halfway. The only thing I don't like is the part the connects into the bud is a little harder than the rest. This is so you can wrap it over your ear and it stays in place. It works I just don't care for that aspect.",1.0

"This product is AWESOME, especially if you don't have a lot of outlets. The useful thing about this is that you can turn the outlets on and off. I plug in my string lights in my dorm to one side so that i can just click it on and off from my bed instead of having to plug and unplug it. The cord is long enough to reach my bed and the usb chargers are useful for when i charge my phone. I also like the spacing of the outlets so I can connect my mac charger without worrying about it being in the way of the other outlets; a common problem with strip outlets. I'd recommend this, especially for those in dorms or rooms / offices with limited outlets.",1.0

With a battery replacement every five to seven years, expect this unit to last longer than I do.  The previous model operated perfectly.  We have a stand-by emergency power generator that takes about 20 seconds to pick up the house load and kick-in.  The previous model always carried the load in the interim with no interruption.  My husband still has the previous model on his computer, and its now in its eight year of service.",1.0

I bought 2, one for my 32&#34; and one for the 42&#34; both tv's went up with ease and are holding up great. we dont much them much other than to maybe clean the tv but the mount does everything it is supposed to and saved me over $70 each mount... I am about to place an order for the remaining tv's in my house",1.0
"This is a wireless speaker suitable for amplifying from a phone, ipod, computer, or other device. The speaker measures 9.5x4x2.75” and weighs just over 2 lbs. In the package, in addition to the speaker, you get an aux cable, a power transformer and cable (110-220V input), and a set of international power plugs including North American, European, and Middle Eastern, and several more, and an instruction booklet in many languages, including English, major European languages, Chinese, and Japanese (6 pages for each language). On one end of the speaker are sockets for power in (for charging the internal battery), USB power out (for charging devices), and aux (for connecting devices that do not have Bluetooth). Also on this end are a set of LED battery indicator lights and a battery check (status) button. On the top of the speaker are push button controls for volume up/down, play/pause, answer phone, and power. The top of the speaker also has a built in microphone for using the speaker as a speaker phone. The speaker is designed to be water resistant; that is, it can withstand splashes or gentle rain, but it cannot be submersed in water. Once the internal battery is charged (4-6 hours for a complete charge), it can run up to 18 hours. It can also be used to charge an external device such as a phone. The speaker can connect to a sound source (phone, iPod, computer) either wirelessly through Bluetooth or with a wired connection using the included aux cable. The speaker can also be paired with a second Braven speaker for stereo output.<br /><br />This is the external speaker that I have been looking for – it has a powerful, high quality sound, in a small portable package. The capabilities of the speaker are amazing, though. Not only can it run without being plugged in to an electric outlet, but you can even use it to charge your phone while you are listening to music. Or using the speaker as a speaker phone for a telephone conversation. The controls on the top of the speaker are easy to reach and manipulate—no trying to find a tiny dial to turn with your fingernail to control volume or power, for instance. I also found pairing the speaker to my phone to be quite straightforward. Overall, I have found this speaker to be provide excellent sound as well as phenomenal versatility. It would be a great choice for a dorm room, kitchen, cafe, home office, even living room, and it will also travel well (especially with all those international plugs).aker are easy to reach and manipulate—no trying to find a tiny dial to turn with your fingernail to control volume or power, for instance.

"I received this KabelDirekt RCA cable free of charge through a very cool program that this company is running. This cable came in two days and I didn't hesitate to use it in my TV room. The ends of the cable are made with a solid metal construction that gives it a high-quality feeling. Hands down, this cable is well worth purchasing over any other similar cable on the market if you want a sleek looking product that is functional as well.",1.0

"We needed to bridge our internet piped in sound via a PC to the sound system running our large entertainment center. We tried various PC's with different sound cards and a couple different USB based DACs and weren't impressed. All added coloration to some extent and sounded artificial. Given the sound processors on the front end of our building wide amplifiers have onboard DACs (good ones)  it eventually dawned on us to simply link the PC to the processors via SPDIF and let the rack do the conversion native with it's higher quality DACs. Problem is coax SPDIF out is increasingly hard to find on PCs, but the Muse solved the problem nicely. Unit detected in both Windows 7 and XP automatically and works flawlessly. It's also solidly built with a metal case. I'm not one to believe in all the jitter nonsense and that SPDIF conversions have different subjective sound characteristics. All that matters is having a solid, commercial/professional DAC and getting the data stream there. The Muse did this without fault.",1.0
as described - very thin and easy to install and use - highly recommend!  good range - one of my local stations is quite a distance away.,1.0

"I realized I needed to buy a second pair of these because I was always wanted to still use them when they were charging on my computer. So I just got a second pair so one is always charged. My first pair were the black and red, and then I got these so I didn't get them mixed up in case I needed to send one back. But there were no problems. I actually think it's worth having two, considering that I use them so frequently, and taking into account how expensive the competitors' are.<br /><br />Update: March now, and they're still going strong, and so is my first pair.",1.0

"Perfect little item, purchased for a 22&#34; TV in the bedroom. Laying flat against the wall it is 9 inches from center point wall hanging flange to center point TV. It extends 11 1/2 inches out from the wall. Easy to install, and perfect for smaller sets and monitors.",1.0
"Holds up my 47in Vizio wonderfully! love that I can swing it out to almost 180 degrees and watch from my kitchen. I did have to screw this into a stud, which made it off center over my fireplace. But the extra security makes me more comfortable with weight of the TV. And the price is unbeatable! Definitely leaving this behind to the renters when I move (I own the house, and would rather them use this than put new holes in the wall trying to mount something else).",1.0
"This thing paid for itself in one month!  I got better reception in Ft Worth, TX than I do in Dallas...but I live in an apartment and can't control my access as well as I'd like. It all depends on where you live in relationship to the towers.  Now I get the few channels I like plus some great old movie channels which I like better than cable!  PBS and Univision were the only ones I really cared about and they come in pretty well.....it's hard to review this product though, because reception will be different for everybody.  Lots of religious channels and Spanish and Vietnamese...even some Bollywood channels, wow!",1.0

"Wish I could give this no stars. The only thing great about this pair of ear buds is the look. I bought these for my son to wear while working out. The very FIRST time he used them, one side stopped working. Would not recommend and would not buy again. Just wish I could get my money back.   Updat: I received a call from the company and the gladly sent a replacement pair. There is a 1 year warranty on the ear buds. I teceived the replacement pair and my husband has been using them at the gym ever since. He advises that he has had no problems with the sound and is very happy with them. Overall, the customer service is impeccable and it turns out that the first pair received was a dud.",1.0

My installer said he never saw one this well made and sturdy. He couldn't believe the price we paid for it. We used it to mount our 55 inch over the fireplace.

"I didn't get all the channels I was hoping to receive, but the ones I did get were very sharp.  I did receive a couple of channels I wasn't expecting.  So all in all I would recommend this antenna.",1.0
"We go to the beach a lot during the summer.  My Galaxy Note 4 phone works pretty well and the speaker is pretty loud, but the battery gives up after about 6 hours of constant music.  I decided to try this speaker.  It came partially charged and I tried to fully charge it before we left for the beach... but only got about an hour in (needs 3).  It paired up easily.  My Galaxy Note 4 preserved a lot more battery since it wasn't running its speaker.<br /><br />Well the speaker sound is really good.  I hung it from the umbrella by the attached carbiner which worked well, then tried it standing on the cooler.  Both worked nicely.  There's very little distortion.  And I could hear it over quite a distance.  It did cut out now and then, but it didn't much bother me.  What was EXCELLENT was that we ran the battery to empty..... 7 hours of continuous play without a recharge.  We were already packing up to leave, so that was fine.<br /><br />If I needed it longer, I would have plugged it into my small Anker portable charger, but it wasn't necessary.  And my phone still had a 50% charge left!  Very cool.  Everyone around us said thanks for the music when they were leaving.  Awesome time, great product.",1.0
I cannot say enough good things about this speaker. I used my daughters while at her house and came home and bought mine imediately. It connects easily via blue tooth but it also has an aux jack in the back to connect with a wire. It is easy to charge and will then last for hours. The sound is really good whether you are listening to an audio book or music. If you want to dress this up you can buy an outfit for it to wear also.,1.0
Works perfect. If you need 220 Volt single phase electricity.,1.0
Good product.  Easy to install.,1.0
It was just what I needed to keep my computer running until I shut it down.  It has a 22 min run time.  The beeping every 30 seconds is annoying.  This is an alert to notify you it is on battery backup.  But the beeping can be shut off in setting.  Worth the money,1.0
Total game changer!  With this antenna and Apple TV you will never need a cable TV subscription. I highly recommend it!,1.0
As advertised,1.0
Fit my ATH-M50x's perfectly. I prefer the feel of the velour pads over the leatherette of the stock pads. These have very high quality foam and super-plush velour covers. They don't cause the headset to leak any more sound than the stock pads at medium to medium-high volume. At high volumes these will leak a little more sound than the stock pads but the volume has to be uncomfortably high to reach that point. They have a slightly smaller inner diameter than the stock leatherette pads and tend to lay &#34;on&#34; my ears a little more than the stock pads that went &#34;around&#34; my ears but they're much more comfortable so I'm not taking any stars away.,1.0
Saves my computer in every storm.,1.0

"Pretty Awesome for its size, doesn't have massive bass but come on what do you expect? this little thing does however, get pretty loud, use power amp app on your phone and you get pretty good sound! haven't tested the battery life to see if advertised is accurate but I am happy to carry this along when I go out for the day and know I have a nice option to play music at a louder and better sound than my phone, without draining the battery life of my phone so quickly,",1.0

I can easily take it anywhere and use it for music and talks that I have recorded to use in workshops and retreats.  Amazing, as I am NOT an electronically gifted person.  I usually let my grandson or my IT savvy son help me with new technology - but this little system and its instruction sheet allowed this grandma of 13 to figure it out all by herself!  And the sound is simply fantastic.  I LOVE this pink case...helps me find it when I have left it on a shelf somewhere.",1.0

"After about a month of use, this tiny, yet powerful, bluetooth transmitter is the perfect device to transform non-bluetooth devices unto one. At first look and upon unboxing, I was somewhat disappointed and thought this tiny little device would not meet my need to transform my Samsung 40&#34; Smart TV unto a blutooth unit so I can pair it with my bluetooth headphones. The first week was phenomenal so I thought I would give it a couple more weeks of heavy use to really test this transmitter's capabilities and endurance. Not only did it pass with flying colors, it also surpassed my initial discrimination (the popular notion that one should not judge a book by its cover definitely implies to this).<br /><br />To power the device, I attached the included USB to MicroUSB chord unto one of my TV's USB slots for constant power (device powers on when the TV is turned on). I would definitely purchase another one for my other TV and would highly recommend this to friends and family.",1.0

The M4U 1's are my return back into full-size cans after years of using in-ear monitors of various quality up to Etymotic ER-4's.<br /><br />I had 3 uses in mind – open office, train commute and digital piano playing. For me, they are great for two: open office and piano.<br /><br />Pro:<br />- balanced, tight sound<br />- excellent for digital piano playing (the Kawai CS-10 hybrid sounds incredible on these)<br />- no obvious coloration, works great on all kinds of genres from classical and opera to EDM<br />- clean and understated classy looking<br />- comfortable fit<br /><br />Con:<br />- just too big for me to travel with, went back to in-ears for commute<br />- on a hot day things get a bit sweaty",1.0

I bought this amazing product because you need to pay more than $20 for the same cable. This cable does the same job as the one at bestbuy. I use this cable so I can hook it up to my xbox directly to my computer monitor and it has a much better picture quality.,1.0
The speaker turned out to be sturdier than I thought it was going to be. I work as a landscaper and needed something durable that had also loud and clear sound. The Evizian delivers with a deep bass that carries a rich resonate sound combined with clear highs. The music carries well up to 100 ft. The speaker seems indestructible which is good since I use it everyday for 4-6 hrs moving around alot through the day. I am not good with all the fancy terminology used on speakers but I would totally recommend it for someone that wants good clean sound without the worry of breaking.,1.0

"So far these have worked great! I purchased this for our small business because the electrical lines were be worked on in our area and would go out without warning for several minutes.

"This saves me a lot of time in the morning. Either I absentmindedly leave my keys wherever I first wandered into the house or they are in the bottom of my purse. Now I can just click the button and know whether to keep searching my purse or track it through the house. Unfortunately, my husband won't use a keychain because he hates when they clank against the key fob and add extra bulk. This is unfortunate because it's expensive when he loses them. It would be nice if the stick-on finders were 1/4 the size or less and much thinner because then I might convince him to use these on his key fobs and remote controls. Also it would be nice if they could all be either a sticker or a keychain in case the purchaser favors one over the other. My daughter had a good idea and attached one of the click n dig key chains to a collar on her security stuffed animal. Now it is much easier to find it when she goes to bed at night.",1.0

"I ordered this product because my new 55&#34; TV came with legs on the side instead on a stand attached to the middle of the unit.<br />Before the Swivel TV Stand's arrival I was worried about how stable this stand was going to be holding my tv and placed top of the shelf I have reserved for it. After putting the thing together I realized it was far superior to any standard TV stand. Not only was it sturdy, but it looks and works fantastically. I saw some reviews on here where people complained about the 30 degree swivel seeming a little too short for their liking, but I have no idea why they would want it to turn anymore - its perfect the way it is.<br /><br />Sometimes people fail to realize that Amazon does not make or own everything they sell. I had a question about installation and I was answered back almost instantly and in a person matter. It's nice not to talk to a computer and be treated like a human being in 2015.<br /><br />When I upgrade to a wall mount or need speakers, I will be buying from this company again. Not even a question.",1.0

However, what I CAN say is that the sound output is plenty loud!  Also, there are like 7 HDMI inputs on the back, so you can get all your components hooked up with HDMI.  I only have a Kodi box and Xbox One on mine, but it's really nice.  The remote is very sturdy.  Setup was also a breeze (be sure and turn your tv on since that's where the setup menu will show...took me a bit to figure that out.  hehe).<br />I like this receiver so much that I recommended it to my father in law, whose receiver was so old it didn't even HAVE HDMI.  So, we updated his system and hooked everything up with HDMI, which sounds (and looks) a lot better than his old RGB connections.  It also has an optical audio port, which is nice.",1.0

"This is the best running headset available.  Obviously it does not fall out of the ear, but it might slip out but its not going to fall out.  The sound is great for the price.  The wire is just right for my phone or mp3 player to be at ateacher to my waist belt.  The only negative  thing is that the clip is loose for the wire so it will move around.",1.0
"These Monster Turbine High Performance Earbuds are hands-down the best I've ever heard (still) and better than most over-ear headphones - and after I'd tried about 10 different Top-Rated brands at the Minneapolis Airport (other Monsters, Klipsh Image S-4s, Bose, etc) I ordered the Turbines. Fantastic! Full-thumping clear bass and kick drums, and clear mids and highs without distortion even at high levels. Presence! Instrument placement as the music producers and engineers designed. Truly amazing. I also got them with Control Talk and I got them for an amazing price drop on Amazon one day - price jumped back up the very next day. Got some decent use out of my buds - then the cat ate through the cord! So with this model cancelled, I ordered their Diesel models - fantastic, too. I preferred these Turbines slightly better overall (only slightly) but the Diesels have a sturdier build. LOVE MONSTER BUDS!",1.0

Phenomenal sound quality! iPod Nano gen 3 finally died. Needed a replacement. Wanted the shuffle because I didn't need the xtras. Went with underwater audio because the idea of swimming without the bulky waterproof box I previously owned seemed great. Blown away by the customer service. Fast delivery is an understatement. First swim was amazing. Turned more than a few heads. Will definately shop with this company again.,1.0
Absolutley amazing! Only probablem I had to go purchase a seperate cable for Apple products but other then that absolutely what I expected,1.0
"My second pair because they are that good. The first pair still works, these are just for another bag. The buds don't go inside and hurt like most small ear phones. But they are rubbery enough to stay put and not fall out EVER even when I am moving from upside-down to upright positions rapidly. The cord is long, I braid mine because my iPod sits high. The sound quality is high enough and the little &#34;funnel&#34; sends music directly into the ears.",1.0

"This charger worked well for four months, though it always easily fell out of both the wall and out of my Fire tablet, and had to be handled with that in mind while charging.  Unfortunately, over the past week or so it has become much more glitchy, delivering an inconsistent charge, sometimes not charging at all.  The wire connects without bends or fraying on either end, but as of today, it has completely stopped working.  I like the extra length this charger provides, and it worked decently until now.  Is 4-5 months the routine lifetime for this type of item?  My longer iPhone charger, also purchased here, is still going strong after a year or so, with no quality issues whatsoever.  Anyway, time to buy another charger for this tablet.  I wish I'd gotten more service out of this purchase.<br /><br />Update:  Because this item has a 24 month replacement guarantee, I contacted Amazon regarding the failure of my charger after 4-5 months.  I was immediately offered a free replacement which arrived with 1-day expedited shipping!  The new cord, as well as working flawlessly, has a design improvement:  both the plug end and the little usb end fit snugly and hold securely, unlike their predecessor.  Big improvement.  All in all, I couldn't be happier with my replacement, nor could I be a more satisfied customer.  Thank you, Amazon!",1.0

I deleted it from the list on my ipod, then when I plugged it back in and my ipod rediscovered it, it works great.  The customer service for Brightech was amazing in proactively helping me get to the bottom of the problem.  Even if it turned out that I had bought a 'lemon', I have no doubt Brightech would have made it right!",1.0

I got a great deal on these from Amazon. I am loving them so much I even invested in a new turntable and have begun listening to albums for the first time since 1985.

"From 38 to 77 channels ...  When my brother first recommended the Mohu to me, I was extremely skeptical.  I have tried many other powered and non-powered antennas.  I was in shocked - aghast disbelief - when the scan completed!  Channels I had never heard of 40-60 miles away.  And I sit just one mile away from Sutro Tower on Twin Peaks in San Francisco.  I can't wait until I take some serious time to re-scan and adjust the Mohu's height and location in my home.  I replaced a $19 RCA antenna from Target that I have used for years.  I am eager to see how the Mohu tolerates changes in wind, direction, and the fog all of which contributed to pixelated and non-existent/lost signals day-in, day-out.   T H A N K  Y O U!  6 STARS!

"Love these headphones for watching moves on my computer! Talk about big sound! They completely block out everything else around you and allow you to focus on the presentation. I think that I should put out there that I don't have great natural hearing. These really help bring out the nuances that I am sure I miss with other earbuds and such. Due to my hearing issues, I have never been a huge audiophile. These may turn me around. SoundTrue is the absolute definition of truth in advertising!  I love the way that the cords completely detach from the headphones allowing for other options in cords (maybe other headphones have that feature, but this is my first such pair). These also lay nice and flat in their high quality case. I feel like they would be super secure when traveling, no problem. The earbud revolution seemed to make over-the-head headphones a thing of the past…but I'm glad that revolution is over and a new one is at hand! Bose knocks it out of the park.

It lights up and has an indicator that displays how folat along you are in the charging process. I really liked this and indicated when the charging is completed.

For many many years I have depend on my iPhone to wake me up with the alarm. I have purchased quite a few generic alarm clocks never quite happy with them so I figured my phone is on the table next to my bed so I will just use that. I purchased this iHome iBT29BC Bluetooth Color Changing Alarm Clock and really do like it. The light looks really neat fading in and out but it can be turned off. I knew I could not sleep with the light so I set mine to stay off. However when the alarm is programed the light can be programed to come on with the alarm. I really like this as it helps me wake up. By the way there are two alarm settings (and yes a snooze). Over all I can not think what would make this a better alarm clock as it does everything it is deigned to do and it had Bluetooth so you can wake up to whatever music you like!,1.0
After the initial disaster on the arrival date of my screen was finally fixed we were able to continue on with our first outdoor movie. The screen and stand are absolutely perfect.

"Very Good Clock radio. I have had mine for about a month.<br />I bought this to replace my old gen1 iHome radio alarm clock.<br />Positives: dual alarms for week days and week ends or any other day you like, blue tooth and aux jack for Iphone/ipod and other mp3 players, and several dimming levels for the clock face including off. I personally like my room very dark when i sleep so i have the display at its lowest setting before its off. I wake up to the radio and its set to slowing increase volume up to my own specified value. You can adjust whether you want it to slowly increase volume and how lowed it can get. The sound quality is also very good.<br />So far the time keeping has been very good. my old iHome would loose time about a minute or 2 every month.<br />Negatives: first hunting for your favorite radio station and making it stick is not the easiest thing in the world. I with it have a dial type control. But once its set up you should never need to change it. Second the 2 alarm off buttons are right next to each other so i almost always hit the wrong one first. My final negative is the height of the alarm clock itself. Its relatively tall next to my bed making it harder to hit to turn off or hit snooze. Not a huge issue but I would prefer a shorter version. It is a little expensive but worth the price.<br />All that said this is the best radio alarm clock i could find on the market that had sound rise technology, a very dim-able display, a FM radio, and dual alarms.",1.0

"Just know that it might not include the hardware you need! I assumed it would and mounting my TV required me to take my TV to Lowes to find the right hardware for my application (Pretty typical 42 inch Samsung TV, I thought).  Besides that it seems fine!  Decent quality, includes most of the things you need.  Nice HDMI Cable that'd probably cost at least 15 bucks from Best Buy (lol ripoff) anyways.  Have to torque down every bolt and didnt include an allen key though, so if you dont own alot of tools know you might be picking some up while you're at your local hardware store getting the right hardware!    Update:  So after I posted this review the company CONTACTED ME and immediately, without questions or hassle refunded me fully for the product without the need for a return.  Customer service from Cheetah Mounts will stand behind their product 100%.

"Bought these bad boys a little over a year ago and I used the crap out of them. I keep them in my gym bag with my running shoes, drop them constantly, I sat on them numerous times on planes. They finally gave up. The sound stopped working on one side of the headphones. I almost bought another pair but V-Moda offers free repair for any technical issue even after the warranty expires. I packed them up and shipped them to the factory in L.A. Less than 2 weeks later, I get a package with my headphones fully functional and ready for another beating. I HIGHLY recommend these headphones. If they work for DJ friends, they work for me. It would be unfair to even compare them to Beats or any of those toy headphone$.",1.0

"In my house we go through batteries like crazy so we decided to switch over to using rechargeable ones.

I was surprised at how much more power these had than the discount batteries. My devices seemed to work a lot better and the pedicure file was so much stronger.<br /><br />I love how eco friendly rechargeable batteries are. I recycle anything and everything possible so I know I am doing my part by using these.<br /><br />These batteries can be recharged 1000 times which is very impressive.

I'm not some sort of crazy audiophile, but you probably aren't either if you're looking at these. They're not Beats or Bose, but they do the job.",1.0

UPDATE!!!!! 5-17-2017 I have bought quite a few of these mounts. I loved them until now... I just recently bought three and they were the same as always.. Last week I recommended them to a friend... His came and it is different. They have made them cheaper and they are not as sturdy. I won't be buying these anymore... Sad.. It was a great Mount. Amazon needs to give it a separate listing since it changed. All the reviews are for the old model....<br /><br />Fantastic Mount for the price. Went together easily and mounted easily. Have bought quite a few of these!,1.0
"I love that I can transfer my VHS tapes to my computer. I was worried that those memories would be lost someday but now I can save them to be watched with modern technology.

"I have thoroughly enjoyed my Bose In-Ear Headphones. They do not get uncomfortable on long listens and the quality is top notch. I listen to a lot of audiobooks.

"I routinely recommend & purchase for friends!!!!  Sound quality far superior to any BEATS, and for a fraction of their ignorantly bloated price.  Only negatives to be mentioned is the remote only works with iOS devices, & no 3.5mm low-profile angled plug.  Needed a replacement cable after 2 years due to this, of which are easily found here on Amazon! Sennheiser's Amazon shop also sells a cable for these with Android remote functionality, & a 3.5mm low-profile angled plug; but it's a crop shoot whether it will work on your Android device(though they are guaranteed compatible with all Samsung devices such as the ever popular Galaxy & Note).  Great set of cans that truly do get better with age!!!  PEACE",1.0

"Mounted a 32&#34; Samsung in our home gym.  It came with everything needed to hang on the wall and mount the TV.  Compared to prices of those you can buy at the local brick and mortar stores, it was much less inexpensive but the quality of he materials were on par with those I saw at the local stores.  And to top it off, it came with an HDMI cord!  If you are thinking about it, do not hesitate and pull the trigger.",1.0
"After purchasing the SHARKK BOOMBOX speaker I was offered this product complimentary in exchange for providing an honest review. I find this WATERPROOF speaker similar to the BOOMBOX with a few improvements in design.  The WATERPROOF speaker comes in the same minimal packaging as its predecessor. Included are the wall charger/USB link cable; AUX cable; and carrying bag. This speaker has a rubber casing with a nice feel. 3 LED lights on the side show battery level and two lights on top show Bluetooth status. Setup and pairing are easy, and the same as the BOOMBOX.  As with the SHARKK BOOMBOX, this speaker doles out very nice sound with ample bass and clear mids and highs. Bluetooth connectivity is nice, but can be glitchy at times. Twice, the power button has not worked and the unit has been &#34;stuck&#34;. Bluetooth did not function when speaker was &#34;stuck&#34;. Eventually, speaker regained normal operation.  I guess what most people are interested in is whether this puppy is WATERPROOF. I subjected this speaker to a sprinkle test, or about 1 minute under the shower head to simulate leaving the speaker in the rain. I then submerged the speaker in 1 foot of water to simulate dropping the speaker in a pool or leaving the speaker on the beach. In both cases the speaker was powered on and playing music. Music play was uninterrupted for both tests and physically the speaker was unharmed. I feel comfortable claiming that this speaker lives up to its name WATERPROOF! Also, it floats.  CONCLUSION: Expect some made-in-china-electronic glitches, but the problems are minimal and ultimately the build quality and sound are excellent for the price.",1.0

"We love Bluetooth speakers in our house, my family uses them daily!<br /><br />This speaker was a tad smaller than I thought it would be from the pictures but that’s okay with me, being compact means I can set it up just about anywhere. A great feature that I found out after I got it in is that you can prop the speaker vertical or horizontal, looks fantastic either way.<br /><br />You can listen to the radio or connect the Bluetooth up with your tablet or phone. The LED color light show has 3 settings: Blinks by in a pattern, bumps along to the music or completely off. The volume gets pretty load and the sound is crisp and clear.<br /><br />I am overall happy with this LED light show speaker!<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an unbiased and fair review which I have provided.",1.0
"I'm not very verbose in my reviews, but I can say these headphones are every bit as good as others I have had in the past. They remind me of the kind I used with my Sony Walkman way back when. They fit comfortably enough given they way I wear them (kind of like a stethoscope) the Bass response is plenty fine, and the volume is also more than enough for me. I tried the earbuds style that cam with my S4 phone and, (smh) i do not care for something in my ear canal. I still want to be somewhat aware of what's going on around me while the music plays. These are also designed very well. I will more than likely pick up another set or two. Just in case I can't find these one's again.",1.0

"Love this, I use it with my Samsung Tablet to watch Netflix and other shows. The sound is fabulous and I had no problem syncing with my tablet.",1.0
"I've owned a number of headphones over the years, and I know what I like : good quality earbuds for portable use, clear and accurate sound reproduction, no perceivable distortion, over ear headphones for desk use, and avoid anything that says &#34;enhanced bass&#34; like the plague. I like DJ type headphones because they're closed (so no one else complains about noise), blocks external noise, have a neutral sound quality (if I want to tweak the sound, I want to do it with an equalizer) and I have a strong distaste for boosted bass, as it tends to drown out the details of a musical piece.<br /><br />The closest thing I have to this is the Sennheiser HD280 Pro, which I purchased in 2003. Even taking inflation into account, this one is still about 3 times what I paid for the Sennheiser. So what's the difference?<br /><br />The most obvious difference is the build quality, The HD280 has come plastic clips on the headband. They broke within the first week of me owning it, and I was only using it at home. I fixed them in place with clear packing tape, and they've held up well over the last 12 years, but it was still very disappointing to have it break so soon after buying. The A5Pro is built like a tank. Lots of aluminum all over. It is heavier than the HD280, of course, but surprisingly not that much heavier.<br /><br />The headphones come with cushions that fit over the ear, but in my case, just barely. I'd like larger ear cushions. The cushions are easily removed and replaced with a slight twist. The included cushions are 93mm in diameter. 80mm (on-ear) and 110mm cushions are also available. The cable is detachable, locks in place when pointing down, and - this is the part I really appreciate - can be attached on either the left or the right. I thought I read that there is a shorter, non-coiled cable with mic input available that can be used on a phone, but I have not seen it for sale.<br /><br />Speaking of travel, it can fold into a really compact size, and comes with a simple cloth bag for transport. When folding the cups up, there is a pretty loud click as a plastic clip releases for it to swivel up. This is the only part I'm worried about it breaking, as it is not easily replaced.<br /><br />Sound isolation is good, but not as good as a well fitted pair of earbuds. It also works both ways - it keeps external noise out, and it keeps what you're listening to from leaking out. The cushions are nice and soft, and fairly comfortable, but if you're not used to DJ style phones, you may find them tight. And you will definitely feel the weight. My HD280 feels more comfortable, but it is like an old pair of shoes, broken in, and the comparison is not fair. I recall the HD280 felt tighter when it was new as well.<br /><br />OK, enough about the construction and the great design. How does it sound?<br /><br />It sounds great to me. I hear all the details very clearly, and it does appear to be quite neutral (I have no way of measuring this except by comparing it to other headphones, like the V-Moda M-80, which sounds a fair bit brighter. Bass is not artificially boosted (yes!) but if you're listening to a bass heavy track, you definitely can hear the bass. I tried it with a range of music, from classical, to vocals, instrumentals, rock, and it performs superbly. Compared to my HD280, it sounds more substantial. Don't get me wrong, the HD280 sounds great, but when comparing it side by side, it sounded a bit hollow. I'm sure I'm not using the correct audiophile terms for this. The difference is not great, but it is definitely there, and easily heard.<br /><br />The headphones claim to be able to handle 3500 mW. I'm not sure what 3500 mW will sound like, but I'm pretty sure it's a recipe for hearing loss. When I first plugged it into my computer, I had the volume at 40%. It was loud! On the bright side, I didn't detect any distortion even at that ridiculous level that was not there at a lower volume.<br /><br />Used with my phone, the soundlevel seemed slightly lower compared to my earbuds, but surprisingly not by much.<br /><br />The only thing that gave me pause is the price. It fluctuates a bit, but no one is ever going to describe it as &#34;inexpensive&#34;. It has a great design, solid build quality, and sounds great. Is it worth 3 times the price of the Sennheiser HD280 Pro? That's a hard question to answer if you're not a professional DJ. If you like DJ style headphones, however, it is definitely worth considering.<br /><br />Now I just need to figure out where to buy the 110mm cushions from.",1.0

"When I see the Bose name and the price associated with their products, my expectations are heightened.  Auditioning these over the ear headphones was a pleasure because they were comfortable, musical and effectively isolated me from surrounding distractions.  Putting these headphones through their paces I saw no need to break them in.  Whether I was listening to orchestral, solo instrument, choral and solo vocal, classical, pop, ragtime, jazz or pipe organ the sound was rich, free of audible distortion and most-importantly well-balanced.<br /><br />The same sweetness that I hear from string instruments in live concerts came through and throughout the audio spectrum from violin to bass.  The intimacy, transparency and clarity of these headphones brings through not just the music.  During a Handel oboe sonata, I could hear the instrument's keys clicking.  Every breath that the flutist was taking in my recording of Poulenc's Flute Sonata was clearly audible as was the breathing of violinist Itzhak Pearlman from his Encores album.  The high-end sizzle that comes from live cymbals was reproduced clearly through these headphones as was the bone-rattling 32-foot pipe organ notes from Virgil Fox's performance of &#34;Widor's Toccata.&#34;  The reproduction of &#34;Chaiyya Chaiyya Bollywood Joint&#34; from the soundtrack of the movie &#34;Inside Man&#34; was spot-on.  These headphones produce clear, full bass notes without being overly bass-heavy or rumbly.<br /><br />For anyone who expects to hear reproduction of their music to be as close to a live performance as possible, I believe that these Bose SoundTrue headphone should satisfy.",1.0

"Great rechargeable batteries!! I have been using rechargeable batteries for a while now and recently switched to the Amazon Basics brand of them..  One thing I have noticed, these are normally just repackaged (And wrapped) name brand batteries costing much less than the big brands (Sanyo, Ect)  These batteries work just as well.. They last just as long.. They charge just as quick!!  I have also noticed they are always accurate on their mAH ratings..<br /><br />Amazon basics is now my new brand of rechargeable batteries and they are now all I order!<br /><br />Tips:<br />1.) These batteries cost more but end up saving hundreds of dollars a year!!<br />2.) Make sure you have a good quality charger to go with these batteries.. It makes them last longer..<br />3.) Mark your batteries and keep them together.. If you have a remote that takes 4 batteries ALWAYS keep those 4 batteries together.. When it comes to rechargeable batteries one battery can be your weakest link!  Keep them together and on the same charge cycle and they will last MUCH MUCH longer",1.0

"This set of black carry bags are indeed premium. All five are soft, yet large enough for larger headphones. Some &#34;premium&#34; headphones don't come with carrying bags, so these are great to keep handy. I have a set of Panasonic Bluetooth headphones that didn't have a carrying case and they fit perfectly. There is enough room to fully close the bag with the ties. The inside is soft and won't damage delicate parts. A great value, very pleased with this purchase.",1.0

If you buy longer quality screws works perfect. You also have to take your time to do a quality job when installing. 2 men required for installation.<br /><br />I have the heaviest TV you can imagine and it works great.<br /><br />If you have a very heavy TV such as mine... Make sure you buy longer screws and use a STUD FINDER. Do not just hang it on the wall. The product is great but It is all about the installation.,1.0

"Does the job and is more than half the price of what you would find at a place like say Fry's electronics. The thing I love about this product is that it's not just a stubby adapter but is a short cable. Why is this important one my ask? Well if you're like me and have a laptop like the original Yoga Pro, you will notice that the mini-HDMI port is right next to one of two USB 3.0 ports. If you already have a mini-HDMI to HDMI (or whatever else output type) cable then you will notice that the USB port is still accessible. However, if you're trying to use an adapter for a HDMI to HDMI output, a stubby adapter will block this USB port access. Hence, this cable adapter, in my opinion, is the perfect fit for any of those out there with the same predicament I previously mentioned.",1.0
I bought these at the beginning of this month and so far I love this product. The sound is great (I can't hear anything but the music) and I'm able to easily take calls while I'm working out. My objective of finding wireless ear buds that stay in my ears while I'm working out has been met. So convenient and a must at the gym! The one complaint I have is that I often find I have no life left on them half way through working out but I believe it is because I forget to power off after each use.,1.0

"To start this review, I was everyone to understand that I use these headphones every single day, and I've waiting long since my purchase to truly see how these things would hold up!<br /><br />That being said, I LOVE THESE. I saw them as a lightning deal and I haven't looked back since I bought them. They are extremely comfortable. I have been working out since I was in high school (I'm a 23 yr. old male, lifting consistently minimum 5 times per week), and I've used Jabra Bluetooth headphones, wired iPhone headphones, and Skullcandy wired headphones. I wanted to change things up after WASTING money on Jabra's products (I don't ever recommend them).<br /><br />I bought these, got a GREAT deal on them, and love them. The band in the back does not get in the way when working out or running (I've used them during both). The sound quality is great out of them, and does cancel ALL of the noise around you. If you want to listen to anyone/hear anything, you need to take them out of your ears. The button functionality is great: you can skip songs, hold down those buttons to increase/decrease the volume, stop/start music, and obviously turn on and off. The charging port is convenient and doesn't come loose, even after handling them roughly and opening/closing it often.<br /><br />The battery life is what should be expected from a set of Bluetooth headphones. It lasts me probably 4-5 workouts, about 1.5 hours each. Do the math. Charging doesn't take a ton of time at all, and I haven't seen a decrease in the battery lifespan as I've continued to use them.<br /><br />But not all reviews can be perfect. The few and far between qualms I have with this product are: 1) the wired portion of the headphones does seem to come out of the casing a little more than desired, but never to a point that is annoying. If it's ever bothersome (and I have OCD), I just twist and push it back in. 2) they don't really work for taking/making phone calls. If you hold you phone, you can use the headphones to clearly hear the other person talking, but it's really not made for making phone calls, so don't buy them for that reason.<br /><br />Lastly, these STAY ON YOUR HEAD. They don't move, they don't come loose and eventually jar off; I can be bouncing like an idiot around my neighborhood (I imagine that's what I look like running) and they stay in perfectly. Love these things. I hope they never die! And when they do, I'm coming back for more!",1.0

"Reviewed many speaker choices and got a lot of advice before deciding on these. Nice size, look and sound great. Just the right amount of range. Handles bass great. Built very solid.

Handle the bass, high, and in between great.  I'm in no hurry to replace these.  Solid, great sound.  Fills the room, pleasant to listen to all types of music.",1.0

"These do exactly what I want for going to the Gym and commuting on the train. They don't fall out. They provide a lot of passive noise isolation. They sound reasonably good. Finally, when I get them all gross after a year of abuse, they are inexpensive enough to replace without concern.<br /><br />They are not audiophile quality, but that is not a realistic goal for my use. They don't provide thumping bass, but that is not a requirement for anyone who likes decent music. Like I said, they do what matters at the gym. They don't fall out and they block the sound of the dreck the trainers play.",1.0

"We purchased a set of these for use in our wireless mics at church. They were fantastic! We got very predictable performance from them every week. The slimline size fit our Shure and Line 6 devices very well. We recently noticed some premature low battery warnings, so we decided to replace the batteries. After checking our records, I confirmed we had purchased these batteries in December of 2013. We got about 20 months of great service out of them. The Ansmann products (both these AA and several 9V batteries as well) have been a solid investment for our church that has helped us save money compared to buying alkaline batteries in bulk every few months.",1.0

"[[VIDEOID:ef77de1944821e6355956b8f8a98fe2]] I have worked with a lot of Bluetooth speakers and have learned quite a bit about the different variations between them. Specifically I have paid close attention to the sound profile, and the current trend is to overdrive the bass and neglect the midrange. This little speaker by iGadgitz does a good job with the sound profile. It has a unique appearance too which makes this a most interesting little speaker.<br /><br />The most obvious feature of this speaker is of course the physical design. It looks a lot like the top of a professional microphone complete with screen and dampener. I have always thought this look is old-fashioned and so I really like the appearance. The screen is more than just a decorative, though - it is strong and provides good protection for the speaker underneath.<br /><br />When set to discoverable mode for pairing the speaker identifies itself as \\""Idol 2\\"". I paired it to my phone and it paired and connected very quickly, less than 10 seconds. It was ready to go and I started streaming music to it.<br /><br />This speaker has very god sound profile. The highs are bright and clear, no complaints there. The midrange is also very good and as a result the music has the right depth, neither sounding lifeless and hollow nor sounding like it is coming through a tunnel. The bass is a touch soft but not weak. The most important aspect of the sound profile is the midrange and I am encouraged that this speaker gets it right.<br /><br />I picked up the speaker and walked away from the source. I found that the range is between 30' and 35' before it starts cutting out or stuttering, but if the base of the speaker is obstructed it starts cutting out a lot sooner. I reversed the process and carried the phone away from the speaker, and the range was the same - approximately 30'.<br /><br />Overall this is a nice speaker and I am pleased with it. Aside from the fact that it looks cool, it sounds very good and have better-than-average range. It's a good choice if you are looking for a small speaker that looks and sounds good.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.tter-than-average range.

"100% worth it, every time. I've been using these for the past three and a half years, and I just ordered my third pair. The sound is amazing, to the point where music from my MP3 player using different headphones sounds weird now. A little steep for earbuds, but it's worth it. On both of the pairs I've had before, one of the ear buds has stopped working after a while, but I mostly attribute that to all the abuse I put them through (wires getting caught on stuff and pulling them out, cramming them into tight pockets, dropping my MP3 player and catching it by the headphones, etc.). Plus, two pairs have lasted me 3.5 years! I do wish they were a little more durable, but other than that a great product!",1.0

"Amazing sounds. I returned these after feeling a bit guilty about it being too expensive, however, recently bought it again as I really miss the fantastic sound it offers. The sound just really pops and I especially enjoy the balance between the clarity and punchy bass.

Although I hope Sennheiser would make the ear pieces more secure as the ear buds accidentally fell out once or twice when I took them out from my jeans pockets.",1.0

"My son was getting ready and packed up for college last week and was stressed because his cord that he had gotten with his Dr. Dre Beats Headphones at Christmas had been chewed up by our puppy about 1 and 1/2 months ago.  I had gotten him a replacement but it stopped working just about 2 weeks ago.  His school is over 5 hours away so after ordering this replacement cord from Grapevine Cables  last week he was really worried that he wasn't going to get them in time before leaving for school.  However, these arrived lightning quick and that made his day (and mine).  He wouldn't have known what to do without using his phone on the long ride to school.  We chose the red ones and since I know nothing about them, I asked him what he thought. Construction wise he felt that they were quality made and he could tell the difference right away in the way these felt versus the ones we got a few weeks back.  The wires and other pieces didn't feel flimsy at all.  It pretty much does the exact same thing that his original cord did and he said he really couldn't tell the difference as far as functionality and sound between these and the original. Thumbs up from us!  We received this product at a reduced price during a promotion in exchange for our honest and unbiased review.",1.0

The best part is that it has a rechargeable battery and can be plugged in, which allows you to use it anywhere. Not to heavy and sturdy handles. It also has wheels with an expandable handle so you can roll it if you need to take it very far.  The microphone that came with it is not bad, but would recommend purchasing a better quality one.

"Works exactly as advertised at a reasonable price.  I use it to run my RoKu to the TV but occasionally display my laptop with an HDMI cable.

This isn't necessarily a problem since the unit is automatic and can sit behind the rest of your A/V equipment.

"So after some testing, I think my brother's phone is the issue (Samsung Galaxy S4?). Using my LG G3, I have no issues with moving the phone around quickly relative to the position of the speaker. I even went crazy shaking them in my hands up and down opposite of each other. No problem with my phone. Unfortunately I am no longer near my brother so maybe there was some other environmental factor at play. Very strange though.  Original Review: The bluetooth module they use is pretty lousy. Went running with it the other day (brother had a phone, and I had speaker), and it stuttered continually. This was probably due to something similar to the doppler effect where the module was coming closer and further away all the time. Had the same issue when I held phone in one hand and speaker in the other. Then if I had phone and speaker in the same hand (very bulky), it had no suttering problems. If you wear other companies' bluetooth speakers/headphones, you would expect that there would be no stuttering as you hold your phone in your hand, but the Omaker speaker did have problems.  Besides this, the speaker seems pretty good when used in a stationary phone/speaker setting. The bass seems pretty good for the size, and it has worked fine so far sitting on a shelf in my shower.",1.0

"Works perfectly. I used this with a Bose A20 and GoPro Hero 4 Black plugged into and [[ASIN:B00M30B4IW Anker Astro E7 battery]].<br />With a 64GB microSD card (and a full tank of gas), this will give you hours of 4K recording with clear audio. My setup: Hero4 Black hanging upside down using a [[ASIN:B0087FFJZG Joby GorillaPod]] from the grab handle above the pilot's seat in a Diamond DA-40. I've seen a few reviews comment on the length of the cord, but I didn't find there to be any issues with this at all (potentially due to the aircraft I fly in).",1.0

"The sound is great, especially for the price.  A key feature not shown is that it comes with an international adapter so it works everywhere in Europe.

"I got this speaker for my children to use while watching videos on my Kindle. The setup was very easy, and now with the speaker both kids can hear the videos perfectly. It is about 9 inches long (see my photos), and it does have a flat strip on one side so that it won't roll away. The LCD display shows that the speaker has 15 volume levels. We have also tried the speaker with my phone (Samsung Galaxy s4), and it works fine as well. The price on this is reasonable/fair. It doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles, but all I needed was a simple speaker with good volume options. This is a good basic speaker for those on a budget.<br /><br />- I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review -",1.0

"Onkyo works good.  One quirk, as soon as I first turn it on to my Direct TV (the cable/sat) selection, the receiver within 30-40 seconds decides it wants to turn itself to the &#34;TV&#34; selection, thus cutting off my sound.  I have to use the remote to switch back the Cable/sat selection, then it is fine.  I am not sure what is causing this.  Have not called techs about this yet.  When the receiver gets turned on no matter where to Blue Ray player, satellite, Apple TV, or Roku it switches itself to the TV selection, then I have to use the Onkyo remote to turn it back to the proper selection, then it works fine.  Anybody know what I am doing wrong, or what is causing this?",1.0

I have a motoryacht and needed a radio with speaker and bluetooth.. The electronics person said it would be about $1500.00 to install a radio and speakers. I found this speaker on amazon and I truly love this speaker. We have been way off shore and pick up radio stations and the quality of the speakers is very good. It gets loud enough and the blue tooth works very well. The battery stays charged at least 12 hours. I am leaving one speaker on the boat and ordering another one for my home soon. You cannot go wrong with this purchase.,1.0

"I've owned upwards of twenty different mid priced earphones, these are still my favorite for the price. They aren't the most durable things in the world, I've broke about 5 of them if you include the version previous to this model (same thing basically, just a little different looks). I usually get a year or so out of each though so its not that bad a deal, especially because they fit well, sound great, don't plug your ears but have the sound of ones that do. Besides the Bose IE2's (which I'm on pair two of), these are the only headphones i could find like them.",1.0

"I've had this speaker for a week or so now and I really like it so far. I work 12 hour days and the battery really does last all day on the single charge as advertised. However, this is only the case if you don't turn the volume up all the way like you would need to if you were working 12 hours on a factory floor like I do. It only lasted about 5 or 6 hours then. Also it would be nice if they included a wall charger adaptor...but those are easy to come by nowadays.",1.0

"A good pair of 18650 rechargeable batteries. The 18650 is becoming the standard battery choice for higher-Lumen flashlight makers, and they are still expensive compared with more common rechargeable AA and AAA sizes. These are 3.7V and Li-Ion.<br /><br />These are fine. They charged up quickly and I've run them through several different lights with no issues. They haven't gotten 'hot' while charging or while being used.<br />I haven't had these long enough to know about their durability. They've certainly been fine so far.<br /><br />Sample sent for testing and impartial consumer review. There are a lot of 18650 battery Sellers now, and the mAh capacity is steadily improving every year (as AA's and AAA's have also been improving). It definitely pays to comparison shop based on both price and overall mAh capacity.<br /><br />I hope this is helpful as you comparison shop online. Happy trails, everybody.",1.0

"I received a free sample for review.<br /><br />I wanted these cable drops to use in two places: my bedroom, and in my office. In both places I have cables which tend to slide off the surfaces easily.<br /><br />On my nightstand in the bedroom, I have a long cable which I attach my phone or iPod to, when I'm in bed. It tends to slide off when the device isn't attached and I'm always looking to see where it fell. This solves that problem -- it keeps the cord exactly where it should be.<br /><br />In the office I also have USB cables which seem to have minds of their own. They fall down behind my desk on a regular basis. I redecorated my office a few months ago in bright colors and the pink and orange fit in perfectly. They keep those cables orderly and on the desk where they belong.<br /><br />I should note that these cable drops are of good size and can handle either a very narrow cable (like a Lightning cable or USB) or a heavier cord (like a lamp cord, ethernet or power cable). Or, you could even get several narrow cables in each if you wanted to.<br /><br />Such a simple thing, but they have saved me so much time hunting down fallen cables already. I wish I'd had these long ago! Life is too short to put up with wayward USB cables and cords.<br /><br />I should also mention that they openings are wide enough to accommodate those flat, tape-style charging cables. (See photo below.)<br /><br />As mentioned above, I received a complimentary package of these for my review after use. But they are so useful I would have happily paid for them.<br /><br />Update, April 2016: I just used a few of these on the back of our TV to corral a few wayward cords. It looks much neater now. Now I'm out of these and have them in my shopping cart to buy more.",1.0

"I love this speaker. I already own the Sharkk Boombox and have really enjoyed that product. The Sharkk 2o has taken an already great speaker and made it better. I typically use my portable speaker outdoors when I am in the pool or hot tub (or various random locations usually with a bottle of beer nearby). While I have never knocked my speaker in a body of water, I am always worried about it getting splashed or spilled on or dripped on. The 2o takes care of that concern by making this speaker waterproof. I love being able to listen to music near the water without being vigilant about my young daughter being too splashy or accidentally tipping a drink onto my speaker.<br />The unit sounds great and has a long lasting battery. I have been using it all weekend, probably about 6 hours total and haven't needed to charge it up (in fact it still has 2 of the 3 display lights lit up which indicate the amount of charge remaining). I love both the long battery life and the remaining charge display features. Few things are worse than thinking you have a party's worth of charge and then having the battery on your speaker die.<br />The speaker comes with an audio aux. cable so that you can connect it to your music source if you want to conserve charge or do not have bluetooth capability. It also features a micro SD card slot so you can play music even without a smart phone or mp3 player. I tried this feature out and thought it was great. You can even skip songs with the buttons on top of the unit. All of the jacks and the card slot are protected by a removable rubber flap to keep moisture and dirt out. It closes easily by pushing in but I ran my finger around the edge of the flap firmly to make sure it was properly sealed.<br />I found it easy to connect to my phone, you simply turn on the speaker, turn your music player's the bluetooth on and hold down the play/pause button and it tells you when it is connected (it actually says &#34;connected&#34; so there is no doubt).<br />I love the look and design of this speaker, it is fairly small but packs a great sound. I find myself using more than my in home stereo system because it sounds so great and I can take it with me where I go (it even comes with a velcro carrying strap).<br />I have tried many wireless speakers and this is my favorite by far. I have lost more than one due to dropping (in water and on hard surfaces) so knowing that this is waterproof and shockproof is very reassuring.<br />I highly recommend this speaker for anyone who wants big sound in a small, waterproof package.<br />Note: I was provided with a free copy of this item for testing and my fair and honest evaluation.love the look and design of this speaker, it is fairly small but packs a great sound.

"I live in a very remote area in western Minnesota on a farm and I pick up 65 channels from up to 250 miles! Yes! 250! I verified the call letters I was getting and looked them up. I live on a farm in a open area, and put this antenna on a tripod with a 20 foot pole on my roof. The trick is pointing it to the direction you want the different channels.",1.0

"Seller offered a free diver mp3 player for a review. I purchased one for myself over a month ago and used several times in the pool. I swim regularly in local YMCA and sometimes got a bit bored of swim drills. Need a good mp3 player that I can listen radio or music.  The diver meets my needs and fits the bill.  Pros: 1) Reasonable priced. 2) Sounds loud and clean in the water. But you need to make sure you push the earbud all the way in. Cons: 1) After several laps, the earbud could still come loose. But you can simply adjust it a little bit and continue the lap. Not a big deal for me. 2) Player freezed one time reading a song. There is no way to reset other than just waiting for the battery to drain out. Overall, give it a try. Hopefully it works for you.  If not, simply return it.",1.0
"The Levin® Waterproof Bluetooth Bluetooth 4.0 IP65 Portable Speaker is exactly as depicted in photos and described in the sales promo; repetition is unnecessary.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Elegant sleek stylish design.<br />Feels substantial and well built.<br />Non-slip rubber casing.<br />Dual 3W speakers with enhanced Bass.<br />Accessible and well marked controls, covered by rubber flap.<br />Easy Bluetooth pairing with mobile phone.<br />Rapid charging - average 4 hours.<br />Relatively loud for its size.<br />Portable and comes with a lanyard to hang anywhere.<br />Dust/dirt proof, water resistant and waterproof to a depth of 6 ft.<br />Accessible and well marked controls.<br />USB and Audio Auxiliary cables provided.<br /><br />CONS:<br />Sub-optimal sound; good high and mid-range but average quality bass (to be expected in portable mini speakers).<br />Poor function as a speakerphone - voice pickup not very clear.<br /><br />In conclusion, I like the design but expected better sound from this &#34;super Bass&#34; dual speakers box. But it is superior to many similar mini speakers on the market today. In my experience, the phone function is unreliable and should have been omitted.<br /><br />I received a free coupon for a complimentary sample provided for testing & evaluation.

"TL;DR<br /> - I ordered both the Sennheiser Urbanite XLs and the Sennheiser Momentums and compared them for 30 days.<br /> - These are two quality, well-priced pairs of headphones.<br /> - I chose to keep the Urbanites, and return the momentums, for two key reasons:<br /> --- The Urbanites are the most comfortable pair of headphones I've ever worn, while the momentums put enough pressure on my ears that I need a break after over an hour of listening.<br />  --- The Urbanites are more portable, and can be safely tossed in a backpack without a case<br /> - The differences between the two pairs aren't in quality. Rather, there are some specific characteristics for each pair that will make some people happier with one pair or the other. A full comparison is below.<br /> - I ordered both pairs USED off of Amazon, each for around $40 off the new price. The packaging was opened but the two pairs were otherwise impeccable.<br />---------------------------------------------------------<br />SOUND<br />Urbanites:  8.5<br />Momentums:  9<br />The overall sound quality was excellent in both pairs. As a former Bose employee, I can say that each of this options will give you the kind of sound you would expect out of a $300 to $400 pair of headphones. The biggest difference between them (and, generally, between any similar-quality headphones or speakers) was the equalization. As other review will tell you, the Urbanites really emphasize the mid bass a somewhat emphasize the deep bass, while the Momentums emphasize the mid range. After adjusting the equalization to account for this, the sound quality was quite similar. I still found the Urbanites to be somewhat tinny at the very top of its high range, but overall, they were both clear, crisp, and gave a very solid performance on a wide variety of tracks.<br /><br />For speech, (in this case, many hours of CS lectures), they were both excellent, and easier to listen to than my external speakers. The Momentums gave a more engrossing experience (which sounded like more like someone was right in front of you), but the Urbanites were actually a touch more comprehensible. I know this because I consistently crank up the lecture speed to 2.0x - 3.0x. With the Urbanites, I could consistently increase the speed an additional notch or two without syllables becoming unclear.<br /><br />SOUND ISOLATION<br />Urbanites:  6<br />Momentums:  9.5<br />In this category, I should emphasize that higher is not necessarily better. The momentums absolutely block out sound, and have a tight seal. While wearing the Momentums, someone right next to me can call for my attention, and I won't notice until they wave their hand. The Urbanites have good isolation (in fact, better than my last pair of phillips), but outside sound can definitely leak in. As someone working in an open office, I do prefer having some sound leak through so I don't enter a conversation around me halfway through having no idea what was going on. In this aspect, the Urbanites are a good balance for me.<br /><br />However, if total isolation is an important part of your listening experience, you will absolutely get more of that out of the Momentums. It should be noted that isolation goes both ways, and you can probably crank up your music a little louder with the Momentums without anyone hearing.<br /><br />COMFORT<br />Urbanites:  10<br />Momentums:  4.5<br />This was the deal-maker for me. I listen to music 80% of the workday, and for several hours a week listening to video lectures. I honestly have never worn a pair of headphones that is as comfortable as the Urbanites are. I can wear them 10 hours a day without any discomfort, which has never been true of other over-ear headphones for me, and certainly not true of any on-ear or in-ear headphones.<br /><br />The Momentums are by no means terrible when you put them on. However, after 1-2 hours of use, for me, I needed a break. The aforementioned tight seal is obtained by putting a reasonable amountof pressure on your temples, and the cups are just slightly too small for my ears. Your experience may vary in this regard, but it's clear that the Urbanites are the winner in the comfort category.<br /><br />AESTHETICS<br />Urbanites:  5<br />Momentums:  7<br />I'm no fashion authority, I'll just give my two cents: I don't really find any pair of over-ear headphones attractive. When they're on your head, you're going to look a little bit like mickey mouse, regardless of what headphones you choose. That said, I did find the momentums to have a nicer, refined look that I could imagine someone wearing in a highly corporate setting without a second glance.<br /><br />DURABILITY<br />Urbanites:  9<br />Momentums:  7 out of the case, 10 in the case<br />The Momentums come with a nice hard-shell case which protects them well. That said, I couldn't bear the thought of anyone throwing them in a backpack without that case. The plastic top and metal sides do feel durable, but their sheer geometry allows stray items to press against their drivers, which are more vulnerable than the Urbanites', and the fact that they don't fold means that throwing your backpack down somewhere could unintentionally cause their aluminum supports to bend.<br /><br />The Urbanites' cups fold in, an awesome feature. Folded, they're less than half the volume of the Momentums' case, and they're in a more protected and flexible position. This, combined with the fact that the whole pair of headphones is incredibly flexible, makes for a remarkably durable set of cans. The drivers themselves also have a hard plastic cage over them underneath the fabric covering, which makes me less worried that stray items will press directly against the drivers and muck with their ability to perform.<br /><br />These are both pairs of headphones that look like they're built to last. If they're just sitting on your desk, I'd even put my money on the Momentums outlasting the Urbanites. However, the Urbanites are built to last inside a backpack, suitcase, or messenger bag without needing a case.<br /><br />Which brings us to...<br /><br />PORTABILITY<br />Urbanites:  9.5<br />Momentums:  7<br />The Momentums' case does deserve some credit here: It's light, it's durable, and it's a lot less bulky than some other headphones you might see. That said, it's still a case, you still have to unzip it, and you still have to adjust your headphones away from the positions that fit your head to the positions that fit the case every time you want to take them anywhere. For someone leaving their headphones at home, this probably isn't a big deal, but for someone constantly throwing them in a backpack and biking to work, it is a bit of a pain. The small folded position and flexibility in the absence of a case make the Urbanites one less thing you have to think about.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I'm not going to give an overall score: These are different pairs of headphones. The momentums give you an immersive, isolated sound experience, while the Urbanites are more comfortable and more more portable. After my month of testing, I chose the Urbanites.<br /><br />ON BUYING USED<br />These headphones both seemed worth their sticker price, but at the end of the day, I saved around $40 and got headphones that, as far as I could tell, were identical to a new pair. Obviously, your results may and will vary, but the return policy on Amazon is the same with used items as it is for new items, so you aren't necessarily stuck if you get a bad pair. I would definitely buy headphones used from Amazon again.of pressure on your temples, and the cups are just slightly too small for my ears.

"I was provided a sample to use and write an honest review.<br /><br />I like the Battery1inc slim 2 port travel charger. It is a great solution as traveler's on-the-road charger. It has one 1A port and one 2.1A port. Great for my iPhone and Kindle Fire when out on the road.<br /><br />The charger is very thin and has folding US style AC Prongs. For the traveler it takes very little space in your bag and the folding prongs help it fit more easily in full bags.  The design of the case is very thoughtful. With the prongs folded mine has no rough edges to catch a thread or damage stuff it's packed in with.<br /><br />In use the charger works great with my Kindle Fire or a Windows 8 tablet and my iPhone 6. In the 2.1A port the Kindle fire charges fast as any charger. The same with the iPhone. The charger gets warm to the touch with charging 2 deeply discharged devices. But not uncomfortably warm at all.<br /><br />In conclusion this simple product just works and proves that size matters in travel chargers. Careful design to take little space and not endanger my clothes with sharp edges or corners to cause a pull or run is appreciated by me. This very compact product is simple and gets the job done. That's a 5 star item for me.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone!<br /><br />UPDATE:: Oct 10, 2017:<br />I've been using this for over 2 years it's perfect for when I travel. I am more concerned than ever with saving space in my bags and this charger is perfect in that aspect. It continues to charge my phone and the tablet I travel with very well.

"Confession....I didn't try these for the express purpose of utilizing them with an android or Samsung device - though I have used them( and still do). You buy BOSE for the sound! It is everything one would want in these type of earphones - comfort, lightness of weight and ease of use. In all of these aspects I would rate them highly. As to the specific use with a phone - I find that the particular feature of accessing phone calls, to be one I rarely if ever use. However, I do use my phone as an mp3 player and for streaming music and for THAT purpose the unparalleled sound of BOSE comes to the fore. Now my main problem is how to keep them out of the hands of my children....",1.0

Noise ISOLATING.  You can also think of it as insulating. They are not... noise cancelling. They sound awesome. The bass is more like BaBaBASS. One of the best wired headsets I have.

Now, these are not noise reducing but they do have a good sound, are very lightweight, and store in an incredibly tiny mount of space.

They are very comfortable and can be worn (and have been worn) for a full day at work.<br /><br />While the headphones are listed as iPhone headphones, they can be used for android phones.  In the case of LG and Samsung phones, the volume buttons on the headset do not work but the middle button can be pressed to pause the playback and resume it.  Not really a big deal as far as I am concerned.",1.0

"Very nice and portable kit for traveling.  One tip ... I had a confusion about 110v vs. 220 v.  I finally realized that the chargers I use are switching power supplies.  That means that they sense the voltage and SWITCH to the proper circuit for that voltage.  If you look at the fine print on your wall wort (using a high power microscope ;-) you will see that they will take 110-220 VAC.  So these are just PLUG ADAPTORS.  IOW, they allow our two blade plug to connect to ones with round pins, for example.  They don't care about voltage at all.  Just sayin'",1.0

"Leveling with a Vizio M70-C3 70&#34; 4K tv.  Everything went well, except for the leveling.  Here's my $1.00 fix.  It takes a leap of faith to let go of that tv after it is mounted, but the bracket does as advertised; except, hold this large size tv level.  No matter how tight I tightened the two screws on the back (Screw S) in the instructions, the tv would still lean to the right (front facing).  I eventually removed the bottom screw and took it to home depot because I was slowly stripping out the head.  I found that this is a metric M5 x 16mm Flat hd Phillips Zinc Plated machine screw with Home Depot part # 574 792. I picked up a pack of those, but also the M5-.8 x 16MM Pan Head Philips machine screw (2 pack) with Home Depot # 204 462 (http://www.homedepot.com/p/Crown-Bolt-M5-16-mm-Phillips-Pan-Head-Machine-Screws-2-Pack-36958/202836136). I ended up using the pan head on the bottom and that worked great, immediately solving the problem.<br /><br />For some reason, no matter how tight I tightened the screws that came with the device, it wouldn't hold. I would recommend actually placing a small level on the top of the tv as well while you're doing this.<br /><br />Here's what it looks like with the pan head machine screw on the bottom hole: http://i.imgur.com/HTQj8ho.jpg<br /><br />Here are the machine screws in their packaging from Home Depot: http://i.imgur.com/dVsFhuz.jpg?1<br /><br />M5 fit at Home Depot:  http://i.imgur.com/uCvvywj.jpg",1.0

"I was a little skeptical about the quality of such a low priced TV mount but I was very pleased to find such a quality product arrive at my door. The install took just a few minutes and didn't have any issues or complications. I mounted a 43&#34; Vizio with ease. The mount seems strong enough for a 70&#34; if you wanted. Everything was included that was needed for the install plus a few extra bonuses. There are Velcro straps on the arm to secure the wires which makes for a very clean look. Plus it includes a 6' HDMI cable also.<br /><br />Great quality, fast shipping. Couldn't be happier and I didn't have to spend $100 at the local big box stores for a lesser quality TV mount.

"I have an old speaker system in my walls throughout the house and it doesn't have a Bluetooth option to play music through it.

So when I got offered to try out this little gadget at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review,  I jumped on it.<br />Well this little device has changed my life. The Assem Bluetooth Transmitter is very easy to use,  connect it to your bluetooth capable device,  plug it into the serious and voila you get music without sacrificing your phone ☺.<br />The sound quality is very good. On some songs you can here a little fuzzy noise but once you turn it up, it disappears.<br /><br />I also tried it out with my old laptop that is not bluetooth enabled and plugged the assem transmitter into the laptop audio jack and connected my bluetooth headphones to listen to something on Netflix. Work like a charm.<br /><br />Overall I can recommend the gadget.<br />It works great as a receiver and transmitter.

"I chose the Cheetah mount for my 40&#34; TCL Roku TV after a lot of researching.  This was a great price ($28) and had amazing reviews.  Now I see why.  The mount itself is heavier than my TV, but not too heavy.  My TV is just very light.  My boyfriend was able to put together the mount and hang it in under than 30 minutes.  It only required two people for the hanging of the TV itself (the mount screws into the TV).  It was a super painless experience, and after a few days of having it, I LOVE it.  It looks so professional to not be able to see the mount at all.  And it moves with ease, but not so easy that it moves without you wanting it to.  It tilts 360 degrees and has a pretty large range of movement.  Not to mention the well thought out packing.  It came with a small level to help you install the mount, and a very nice corded HDMI cord that is 10' long in case you need a longer cord than what you were using with the TV closer to the ground.  I would highly recommend this TV mount!!",1.0

"It's amazing how well these things hold up to being in sweaty ears.  They're comfortable and do exactly what they say they do.  Provide a good seal and stay put.  A quick bit of size advice since it's not always obvious.  They say to order the same size (s/m/l- not the line #) that you'd normally use in the stock silicon tips.  My version of this is to compare it to using compressible foam ear-plugs.  If you can roll a set of foam ear-plugs up and insert them as per instructions and have them be all but unnoticeable in your ears- go for the size large.  If you put in foam ear-plugs and they just peek out off your ears, go for medium.  If you put in foam ear-plugs and they barely go in, go for the small.<br />fwiw, I've found the 500 series seems to fit the mpow/copies of the Swifts and Cheetahs even though there's no official compatibility on their chart.",1.0

"One thing is perfectly clear to me with regard to CNET and their recommendations-- they definitely have preferences. But, on the whole their recommendations are far better and reliable than other &#34;established&#34; media outlets.<br /><br />As I type this review I'm listening to MoFi's version of Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald's second album of duets, Ella and Louis Again. And, it's listening to premium recordings where the you can hear and feel the difference between brands and models.<br /><br />The L2BO/27 is first and foremost, a &#34;Prosumer&#34; grade headphone, which is to say it is (and supposed to be) significantly better than consumer grade headphones of any and all varieties. This means not only sound reproduction but the quality of material used. And, these L2BO is made with premium leather and metal siding from end to end, no plastic here. Plus, you also get a beautiful carrying bag and stereo plugs for your home system.<br /><br />*** Burning In ***<br />Now, because these are premium Prosumer grade, these must be burned in for at least a day. By burning in, I mean plugging in the headphones into a stereo system and letting various music played through for hours at high volumes. What this does is to create flexibility in the speaker cone. The skin of the speaker becomes more in tune with the music signal and is better able to translate those subtle signals that are always there. To the end, this means that you're actually hearing sounds clearer and cleaner than what you're able to hear on consumer/budget priced headsets.<br /><br />Prosumer sets like this Philips should also provide a very comfortable listening experience for at least several hours and I absolutely feel you can have these on for 4-6 hours with fatigue.<br /><br />*** Style of Headphones ***<br /><br />These are what the industry calls &#34;Open Back&#34; (as opposed to the more popular &#34;Closed back&#34;) headphones. There are considerations that must be taken when considering this model or any Open Back headsets.<br /><br />The Open Back headsets feature an air open on the ear piece to allow air to circulate BUT it's primarily there for the drivers that transmits the sound signals. In an Open Back headset, the full (360 degree) range of the drivers is transmitting a signal. That is the side facing your (and my) eardrums but also the back side. This produces a sound that is free and not muffled by, for instance, a closed back design that has to have design which the sound coming from back side of the driver is either reflected back to the front or it is blocked by the closure of the speaker wall.<br /><br />The downside (if you can call it that is, you hear exterior noise through the opening that is means for the backside/ opposite side of the drivers.<br /><br />The Open Back Style is generally NOT recommended for outside use or in an area where there's a lot of noise.<br /><br />This style of headphone is for private, quiet room listening of CD's, DVD-audio or SACD premium recordings.<br /><br />I love the sound that these headphones produce and it's is my opinion that it is better than CNET's 4 star rating. It's 4.5 or better, especially if you have priceless uncompressed music that you wouldn't waste your time listening to with consumer grade headphones.<br /><br />These are exceptional and, in my opinion, are a far better value than some of the trendy name brand headphones<br />Commenting this model or any Open Back headsets.<br /><br />The Open Back headsets feature an air open on the ear piece to allow air to circulate BUT it's primarily there for the drivers that transmits the sound signals.

"So i picked these up from my work on a heavy discount but i felt the need to personally review these for other's sake. These are some of the nicest headphone's i have ever had the opportunity to use. Very clear and distortion free high's and low's with very subtle but rich bass on song's where it is a huge element. The sound quality it superb on every genre of music I listened to with them. The only possible draw back i can give about these headphones is that the wire's do give a somewhat recognizable reverb when touched, although to be fair i have noticed this on all of the other noise canceling headphone's I've used in the past so I don't count that as a huge issue. All in all these headphones are top quality and I would highly reccomend them to anyone who was looking for a good pair of high end earbuds.",1.0
"[[VIDEOID:aef2960dfec761d8316408574cdf78a5]] The iGadgitz Volcano Bluetooth speaker is one of the more unusual speakers I have seen and used. It is a small speaker with unusual controls. Unusual in this case is not a bad thing, though - this is a good speaker that works well.<br /><br />This is a small and attractive little speaker, a little smaller than a 1-cup measure. It is a cylinder with a recessed speaker in the middle of th top, hence the name. It has a brushed steel finish on th outside and overall is not unattractive.<br /><br />I ran into a slight problem when I was testing with it that proved to be a minor issue and was easily remedied - in the middle of testing, it ran out of battery power. When the battery was exhausted, the speaker simply cut off with no indicator that the issue was coming. While that's ok, it would have been nice to have had a little warning that the battery was dying. Other than this little detail, this speaker has not given me any issues at all.<br /><br />It pairs and connects with no issue. When turned on and set to pair, it broadcasts its ID as \\""Volcano 2\\"". I paired it to my phone and it very connected and was ready to go in a few seconds, faster than most other speakers I have used.<br /><br />I fed some music to it and it demonstrated a good sound profile. The bass is a little soft but not unacceptable. The midrange is good and as a result the music has a decent amount of depth, sounding neither hollow or like it came from a tunnel. The highs are good and are very clear. When it comes to the sound profile of Bluetooth speakers many tend to overdrive the bass and kill the midrange, but this one is better with the midrange - very much preferable.<br /><br />Where this speaker gets interesting is in the volume control. The control is actually a movable ring on the underside of the speaker and by turning the speaker while it's on a flat surface it is possible to adjust the volume up or down. It took me a little practice to get this right, and I conferred with the documentation to make sure. This is one of those rare cases with a Bluetooth speaker where I do recommend reading the included documentation.<br /><br />Operating range is somewhere between 30' and 35' before it starts to cut out or stutter. This is above average and just makes this speaker even better.<br /><br />I like this speaker. It has good sound, good range and interesting controls. The fact that it looks cool is a bonus.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.right, and I conferred with the documentation to make sure.

"We've had a Vizio smart TV for close to three years now and a few buttons on the original remote no longer work. Our original didn't have the QWERTY side but even so, this version works fine with ours. We've only tested it with Netflix though. We control YouTube with our iPhones. (I wish there was a remote app for this TV!) For the price, this was well worth it. I just wish I'd done it sooner since the remote is pretty essential to using the apps and our kids are prone to misplacing the other. The new remote is for Mommy and Daddy only and kept way out of the kids' reach. Our kids are only allowed to use the junky remote now. :)",1.0

Excellent little speaker. Bought it for my son to hook up to his phone. Better build quality than i thought operates easily for non tech savy people like myself because i tested it before giving it to him. I am somewhat of an audiophile and i was impressed with the sound output. Its not going to hit the low notes well or rattle windows odviously because its a small wireless speaker physics just wont allow it. But given what it is you really cant beat it for the money. Good volume clear but not overwhelming highs nice midrange and like i said the low end extends further down than I thought but its just not going to reproduce that kind of sound so dont expect it out of any little speaker. I am going to get myself one i am that happy.,1.0
"I'm in love with these headphones! For the price they are damn near perfect. The controls are great, even though I have the occasional glitch, still so handy. The mic works surprisingly well everyone says I sound clear when making calls. The sound is good at least as far as my untrained ears can tell.<br /><br />I got the white and like how it looks with my fair skin and bleach blonde hair. It folds up so small I can slip it into a non tight pocket no problem. The charge lasts FOREVER! I've had it 6 weeks? listening on average 2 hours a day often much more and I have charged it only 3 times! Once only b/c I listened to it for probably 24hrs straight while flying across the country and back.  Comfortable and functional. My only gripe is that the led light is very bright especially at night. On the bright side it doubles as a safety feature while I'm out biking at night. :) Would definitely recommend and buy again!",1.0

Thought, maybe they need (batteries) to be charged-duh!  Charged them, then, it worked (charger for phone with each of the batteries, as it takes one) fine.  Quality product.",1.0

I've had mine for upwards of a year and there are some quirks that need to be addressed. Everyone complains that it is too sensitive and activates in your pocket. You just need to put it in a glasses case and then it doesn't click in you're pocket. Other than that its amazing! Bluetooth,1.0
"Right off the bat I'll say that I've used an awful lot of Bluetooth Speakers and Headphones, so I guess I'm always looking for the perfect one, and the TT-SK08 could just be that. You see I need a portable speaker to connect wirelessly to my phone when I'm in the garden, working in the garage, tidying up the workshop or fixing the car.<br />This means that the speaker is going to get dirty, wet, dropped and kicked around a lot, and  so the unit I need has to be up to all that, and so far, this speaker from Taotronics is just that.<br />The battery lasts long enough, the speaker is loud and has plenty of bass, and I haven't been able to break it yet (and neither has my son) so it's recommended, and I'd like to thank Taotronics for sending me one to review.",1.0
"Getting rid of all those power strips and having just one, up and out of the way of my dog's curiosity, makes this an excellent purchase.  Plus the really nice part is the receptacles are placed far enough apart that those big, space hogging, power cords fit easily and don't block another receptacle like they do on a regular power strip.",1.0
"Awesome. So much better, cleaner looking and more convenient than the wall a/c adapter that came with it. Well worth the price.",1.0

"I have a few bluetooth speakers but none that compare to this one!<br />I purchased the Bluetooth Waterproof Speaker by SOUNDXLTM for my 16 year daughter because she asked for one to use in the shower. Since I was offered this speaker at a discount for my unbiased review, I thought I'd try it out.<br />As soon as it arrived she had the box open and was ready to test it out.  It connected quickly to her phone and &#34;talked&#34; her through so she knew it was on and connected. The suction cup included with the speaker stuck to her shower without slipping and has been there for days without falling off.  The sound quality was much better than I would expect from such a small speaker and the volume is loud enough that I can hear her music from the other side of the house.  Even with the volume all the way up, the sound is not at all distorted as it is with most smaller speakers.  I'm extremely with this purchase!",1.0
Great cable. No need to spend 18 bucks for an hdmi cable at the big box store,1.0
"Beautiful portable bluetooth speaker. Pairs perfectly with all my devices (android, PC) and sound quality is pretty good for a speaker of this kind and size. Small and sits quietly on my desk and doesn't take up space. Control buttons are easy to use. Very nice battery life.",1.0

"These are fantastic. Originally bought them for my grandson because I had bought a pair for myself and he kept asking to use them. But, my husband is now using these ones. Now I'll need to buy another one for my grandson again. Great value, great sound and very comfortable.",1.0

"Bought as a gift for a co-worker who was moving back to Florida...we had a luncheon for her at work and everyone absolutely loved this gift.  It was bought for storm season in the south, but we live in the north and would it would come in just as handy in the winter.  It worked right out of the box and she had a great time testing out all the light and sirens.",1.0
