I ordered two of these to save on shipping and figured the extra tube would be good for relube in another year or two.  After applying one vial, it seemed even worse than before.  (Tread "catches" as I walk.)  So I applied the second vial just to make it usuable.  (Still not great.)  This stuff is overpriced and either they don't give you enough or it's poor quality

This stuff has a very strong smell -- like WD-40 or something.  If you can stand the smell, you might as well buy a can at the local hardware store -- at least then you'd probably get a little straw that could be used to spray it under the center of your treadmill belt.

I bought this stuff because I thought it would be odorless, like all other treadmill lubricant I've bought.  But it isn't odorless.  It really stinks.  I don't like that permeating smell in my house, especially in my workout room.

I recommend the LifeSpan 100% silicone lubricant.  It's a little pricier for the quantity you receive, but it's the good (odorless) stuff

I purchased this matt to protect my laminate flooring from the weight of my heavy elliptical exercise machine. Unfortunetly, the matt is not thick and compresses to paper thin under the weight of the elliptical. I would not recommend this to anyone with anything more than very light exercise equipment

This is the biggest joke on the planet. No doubt, it is scary, but c'mon people. I guess it's to scare the sh*t out of you.
My comment has to be the first serious review that has been made for this item. 
Think about it . . . the toilet. One of the best places for germs. And you want to attach some rubber device to it.
I'll do you one better, and you'll get just as good a laugh from it. (Also, it'll be a lot cheaper)
Go buy a roll of Saran-Wrap. Cling it tightly to the top of the toilet bowl. Wait and watch as your guest visit the bathroom to use it.
I don't think no one will die from this type of trick

I consider my dogs to be small - they are all around 25 pounds.  I have had to tighten everything on the backpack to keep them from being too loose and I still feel like they are a little bit too big.  I think that for a "small" backpack, that they are just too large.  Thank you

I purchased the ab lounge 2 online, but returned it the same day.

It's too bulky & heavy.  I wanted it for my bedroom to use in the mornings while watching the news, but it's too heavy to move around, and it DOES NOT FOLD.   I put it together in my living room, and then tried to get it into my bedroom BUT IT WOULDN'T FIT THROUGH THE DOOR.  I had to un-screw the bars, fold & pull it through the door.

If I had put the AB Lounge 2 downstairs, then I would never use it.

Unless you want the "AB LOUNGE 2" to be a "PERMANENT" fixture in your bedroom or living room, then I would order something else.

I need this thing to be where I can easily use it & then put it away.......The Ab Lounge 2 is way too big & bulky for that.

Unless you have a room where it will remain a permanent fixture, then don't buy it.

I'm buying the "Ultra" Ab Lounge because it folds for easy storage....It's more expensive, but to me it's worth the convenience of having the "EASY" storage capability.

I don't my exercise equipment to be sitting in my bedroom or living room when it's not in use.

I myself is a Proform treadmill customer and tortured by their customer services. I also found some reviews on the internet mentioning their machines broke down in several months after purchase. (Mine in three months.) The strategy of the customer service is basically make wild guesses of what went wrong and send you the parts asking you to replace it by yourself. (In one occasion, they even asked me to take off the motor and find a local garage to test the motor to see if it's good.)These back-and-forth guessing games normally drag on for months, and eventually they claim the warranty expired and they can no longer serve you, even though it's still within one year.
I believe you are looking for a treadmill for exercise, not to practice your debate skill over the phone with some customer service keep saying: "this is our policy.

This product description is correct concerning putting the unit together and the portablity of the unit.  What it doesn't say is that you really get a workout.  No matter what incline it is in, it feels as though you are walking up a hill in sandy soil.  If you want a strenuous workout, then this unit is for you.  If you simply want the unit just to simulate normal walking on a level surface, then this is NOT the unit for you

I guess you get what you pay for.

This pedometer was difficult to calibrate, and continued to miscount steps, and therefore distance, covered.

It is made of plastic, and came unclipped easily.

I am a big person, and have started walking to improve my health. This product does not work for me, although it might be a different story for a slim person.

It has been relegated to the junk drawer, and probably will eventually be thrown away. I'll have to find another that works better and purchase it

Initially, the 340 was way too sensitive to be even remotely accurate. It did, however, give my wife a good laugh; she was sure that at least 5000 of my 10000 'steps' were registered while sitting perfectly still and clicking the TV remote. But after one week of use, the darn thing became so *in*sensitive that it would only register when I jumped up and down like a pogo stick. Pass on this one

I gave this pedometer one star because it is not for anyone who wants to use it straight off of the shelf.  This pedometer can work if you do not mind working on it.  It has problems that need modification.  

The top of the clip on this pedometer pushes against the body, making the vertical angle 20 degrees or more off of plumb.  That means the weighted arm inside drags on the circuit board and does not move freely.  Remove the factory clip and the tabs that hold it.  Add some adhesive Velchro to the back of the case.  Make a fabric band for your ankle.  Attach the ends to each other with Velchro.  Put a strip of Velchro on the outside of the band for attaching the pedometer to the band.  I get  accurate readings with this pedometer when it is attached to the inside of my right ankle.  I got inconsistent readings with it on my waistline.   

The hair spring that returns the weighted arm to its upright position weakened considerably after about ten miles and the pedometer drastically undercounted.  I opened the pedometer and added a strut to brace the spring.  The strut is made of thin brass.  Aluminum from a soda can would work, too.  I made a "V" in one end of the strut to hold the spring.  I pushed lightly against the spring from the left side, drilled a hole in the brass, and anchored the strut to a screw on the lower left part of the circuit board.  The strut angles up just slightly from the screw that anchors it.  I now have quite a few miles on the pedometer.  (I have a theory the spring weakened because its solder joint to the circuit board may have broken slightly and allowed the spring to twist freely.)

Several times the pedometer reset itself to "0" for no apparent reason.  I know nothing pushed on the reset button.  One incident was while it was going through the scanner at airport security.  Once it reset while I was walking.  Twice it reset while I was napping on the sofa.  I am thinking a charge of static electricity overwhelmed the circuit, but I do not know.  Static electricity from too many synthetic fabrics can be a problem with more expensive pedometers, too.  

This pedometer uses a counter circuit.  If someone needs an inexpensive electronic counter, connect a wire to the weighted arm and another wire to the coiled spring it contacts.  Connect a button switch to the two wires.  Freeze the weighted arm in place with hot glue

We bought our machine 2 weeks ago. It looks wonderful, nice sturdy, with alot of different features, but we haven't been able to use it. It didn't work from the day we brought it home and have been fighting with Ironman's Customer Service Department ever since. They keep giving us the runaround saying different technicians are coming but nobody ever shows up. Evertime we call their 1800 number we're on hold for at least 30 minutes before we even get to talk to a person and then they just lie and say they will either call us back or have someone out that day. Well after 2 weeks, we've had it! We're taking it back and never buying another Ironman product again. They're nice machines with good warrentys but what good is it if they won't get anyone out there to fix it? Nothing against the store, they've been great. Just 2 big thumbs down for the manufacturer

The first time I used these push-up bars the flimsy plastic they're made out of cracked in three different places.  Perhaps they will still hold up and not fail entirely, but I'm not going to risk an injury finding out.  In the trash they go... I suggest you buy some that are made out of metal tubing

This does not fit on Super 9 rifles as far as I know.  Besides, it first off has a too high zoom and also is tiny! (Most scopes are whatever zoom X30. For example, I own a 3-9X44 scope. This means it is adjustable from 3 to 9 times zoom.  The second number refers to the size of the scope lens.  I'd seriously reccomend a 3X30 if you can get one.  Also make sure it's dovetail if its for the super9 otherwise make sure it is a weaver rail.  If you are getting it for the Super 9 do not forget to unscrew the rear sight (peephole)

I purchased this bike rack because I was moving out of state and didn't have enough room in the back of my car for the bike.  
I also needed a rack to transport my bike to local trails, parks, etc.  So, I went with Schwinn given the brand name and that it was relatively inexpensive.  

I drove from NC to Fla, approx 700 miles, bad idea with this rack.  I didn't have any trouble assembling the rack, only took about 5 minutes and was ready to go.  However, during my trip, I had to pull over on the side of the interstate no less than 5 times to tighten the straps back.  The buckles do NOT hold the straps in place.  This is a real problem if you are travelling on a highway (or any busy road) and you have to worry about your bike flying off the back into oncoming traffic.  Also, even if the buckles hold, The wind drag from the bike starts to pull the brackets right off of the rack frame.  I had to purchase 4 bungee cords and rope in order to secure my bike from flying off the back (and yes, the rack was assembled correctly).  Bottom line, this rack is probably a great value if don't plan on driving more than a a few miles or over 40-50mph, otherwise, it is a a complete waste.

I bought this model a year ago, and replaced the deck after approximately 8 months.  Just recently, the deck cracked again.  Of course the warrantly no longer applies.  Save yourself the headache of dealing with this company and spend a little extra to upgrade to a better brand.

I myself is a Proform treadmill customer and tortured by their customer services. I also found some reviews on the internet mentioning their machines broke down in several months after purchase. (Mine in three months.) The strategy of the customer service is basically make wild guesses of what went wrong and send you the parts asking you to replace it by yourself. (In one occasion, they even asked me to take off the motor and find a local garage to test the motor to see if it's good.)These back-and-forth guessing games normally drag on for months, and eventually they claim the warranty expired and they can no longer serve you, even though it's still within one year.
I believe you are looking for a treadmill for exercise, not to practice your debate skill over the phone with some customer service keep saying: "this is our policy.

Billy is great, full of energy and enthusiam.  I get great results from his workout much better than any other instructor. My family get great results from his workout.  His customer service rep were helpful.

HOWEVER, I strongly, strongly recommend ordering your Taebo products through Amazon.  I've been doing business with Amazon many years and have placed over 150 orders.  I never, never once had any problems with my orders at Amazon.  When I had questions, it's amazing at not only how quick Amazon will reply but will give a long thorough and kind explanation.  Because they reply within a day and take so much time with the response, it shows they truly care for you and want to give you the best service possible.  I've never found customer service of this  very high and rare quality.

In November of 2005, after ordering the Billy Bands from the official Billy Bank's website.  I was sent a package, without my permission from the company that contained Billy's energy formula supplements.  It was a 14 day delayed bill for 31.85.  I was upset this was sent without me knowing but here's the worse part.  I contacted customer service, a gentleman told me don't worry you haven't been billed just send us back the package and we'll credit you $5 into your account for the shipping, packaging, and mailing cost you pay out of your own pocket to have the items sent back.  Within a few days I send the product I never requested back.  Twice by phone and once by email from 3 different cust rep I was told I would receive a $5 credit to my bank account within 7 to 10 days.

I was already upset about this matter but it wasn't that big of a concern.  However, about 2 weeks well over 10 days I never received the $5 credit to my account.  But there was a charge taken from their company without my permisson or authorization from my own personal bank account for $8.97 .  A few days later the $8.97 was put back into my account.

When I contacted the company this is their reply: 
Thank you for your recent e-mail. We apologize for the inconvenience. Our records show that your vitamin shipment was on a 14 day delay billing cycle (I sent the item I never wanted back in 7 days not over the 14 day limit). This means that when the charges actually went through, you were only charged for a small portion of the amount that showed on the invoice (I kept the copy and nowhere on the invoice is this stated). You received a credit for the shipping and handling plus 5.00 dollars to ship it back too. This means, when the charge for the vitamins actually went through you were only charged for 8.97. This is also the refund that you have received, the amount paid (again since the item was sent back within 14 days I shouldn't have been charged and nowhere on the invoice is this stated that I would only be charged a small portion).

So basically they sent me a product I never requested.  Told me they would give me some money to have the product sent back.  Took money from my bank account without me knowing and paid me back with my own money they stolen.

To sum it up, do business with Amazon!

I bought the set in a rush without reading the reviews, big mistake! The Cardio Boot Camp is missing which makes the prescribed program not work as the workout that you need for week 2 and 3 is missing.  The beginner boot camp is boring though the advanced is challenging fun.  If I knew what wasn't included I wouldn't have bought it.  They should list what's not included in the description.  It seems somewhat deceptive

I bought this hoping it would be a cheap and easy way to do crunches in the living room while watching TV...

I wondered how the thing worked since the pictures and blurb are less than descriptive.  What it boils down to is that this is a "foot hook" tied to a bar with a nylon strap.  The nylon strap is cheap and appears that it will wear quickly.  The idea is you hook the bar under a closed door then do sit-ups/crunches...the problem is that the nylon strap doesn't actually hold your feet down.  I wanted a product that would hold my feet down and allow me to use it in the middle of the room.  Negative on both accounts.  You need a good sturdy door to implement this product, and then it still doesn't truly hold your feet down.  

Looks like I'll break down and buy one of the bars that actually clamps to the bottom of a door to hold your feet down

Rechargeable flashlights are a sensational idea - an essential part of any family's emergency kit (and ecologically smart to boot). While this product is satisfactory for, say, a science demonsration on the Faraday Principle, its usefulness as a flashlight is considerably more limited. 

To its credit: This flashlight was meant to last, and will stand extremes of water and temperature. When dropped into water, it will float beam-side up for easy retrieval. It's so sturdy tha, it will likely last for the lifetime of the user - and you can't say that about too many products. 

Shake this light for a while, and a disk of rare earth conducts enough current to sustain a light for a small amount of time. While you may read claims of up to one or two hours, a faint but workable current only lasts for about ten minutes, and then you shake again. And again. As long as you don't mind the repetition, the wan stream of bluish light will serve your purposes in a blackout or some other emergency. But don't entertain thoughts that you'll be able to read, find small objects, or perform any kind of detail work.

If you don't have a chance to compare this to its better competition, you might not know that say, the Sherpa Xray offers a well-focused beam you can read by. While no rechargeable can give you the kind of illumination you'll find in a traditional flashlight, your options are brighter if you stay away from the Diamond Gen. Invest in something more powerful and you'll find that a flashlight's usefulness becomes considerably greater. 

This flashlight was disappointing, and useless in any practical context

EVERLIFE IS LITTLELIGHT, November 22, 2005
Reviewer:	AGNAZZO (Tampa, Florida United States) - See all my reviews
LIVING IN FLORIDA I BOUGHT TWO OF THESE EVERLIFE FLASHLIGHTS. THE PARTY THAT SAID THAT THESE FLASHLIGHTS ARE CHARGED UP DURING SHIPPING IS SUFFERING FROM SHAKING OF THE HEAD. IT TAKES AT LEAST A MINUTE OF SHAKING AFTER DELIVERY BEFORE THE FLASHLIGHT IS GIVING OUT ITS MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF LIGHT WHICH IS VERY LOW. AFTER THAT TO KEEP IT OPERATING MORE SHAKING IS IN ORDER. THE ILLUMINATION WHICH IS VERY LOW COMPARED TO OTHER BATTERY FLASHIGHTS DIES OUT VERY RAPIDLY AND NEED ADDITIONAL SHAKING TO KEEP IT GOING. THIS FLASHLIHGT TO BE FAIR MAY COME IN HANDY DURING A HURRICANE POWER FAILURE. LED FLASHLIGHTS THAT USE BATTERIES ARE FAR SUPERIOR TO THESE SHAKING FLASHLIGHTS.THE BATTERIES LAST A VERY LONG TIME DUE TO THE LOW POWER THAT LEDS OPERATE AT

This stuff has a very strong smell -- like WD-40 or something.  If you can stand the smell, you might as well buy a can at the local hardware store -- at least then you'd probably get a little straw that could be used to spray it under the center of your treadmill belt.

I bought this stuff because I thought it would be odorless, like all other treadmill lubricant I've bought.  But it isn't odorless.  It really stinks.  I don't like that permeating smell in my house, especially in my workout room.

I recommend the LifeSpan 100% silicone lubricant.  It's a little pricier for the quantity you receive, but it's the good (odorless) stuff

I purchased the ab lounge 2 online, but returned it the same day.

It's too bulky & heavy.  I wanted it for my bedroom to use in the mornings while watching the news, but it's too heavy to move around, and it DOES NOT FOLD.   I put it together in my living room, and then tried to get it into my bedroom BUT IT WOULDN'T FIT THROUGH THE DOOR.  I had to un-screw the bars, fold & pull it through the door.

If I had put the AB Lounge 2 downstairs, then I would never use it.

Unless you want the "AB LOUNGE 2" to be a "PERMANENT" fixture in your bedroom or living room, then I would order something else.

I need this thing to be where I can easily use it & then put it away.......The Ab Lounge 2 is way too big & bulky for that.

Unless you have a room where it will remain a permanent fixture, then don't buy it.

I'm buying the "Ultra" Ab Lounge because it folds for easy storage....It's more expensive, but to me it's worth the convenience of having the "EASY" storage capability.

I don't my exercise equipment to be sitting in my bedroom or living room when it's not in use.

Got the mat for free for ordering the Series 7 treadmill and while putting the mat under my treadmill it ripped.  It is made by this rubbery plastic, and it's just okay.  I wouldn't pay $100 for it, it's true, but I was very disappointed that it ripped so easily.  Not very durable... but I got mine for free, so I guess I wasn't too surprised it was given away.

I myself is a Proform treadmill customer and tortured by their customer services. I also found some reviews on the internet mentioning their machines broke down in several months after purchase. (Mine in three months.) The strategy of the customer service is basically make wild guesses of what went wrong and send you the parts asking you to replace it by yourself. (In one occasion, they even asked me to take off the motor and find a local garage to test the motor to see if it's good.)These back-and-forth guessing games normally drag on for months, and eventually they claim the warranty expired and they can no longer serve you, even though it's still within one year.
I believe you are looking for a treadmill for exercise, not to practice your debate skill over the phone with some customer service keep saying: "this is our policy.

This product description is correct concerning putting the unit together and the portablity of the unit.  What it doesn't say is that you really get a workout.  No matter what incline it is in, it feels as though you are walking up a hill in sandy soil.  If you want a strenuous workout, then this unit is for you.  If you simply want the unit just to simulate normal walking on a level surface, then this is NOT the unit for you

I guess you get what you pay for.

This pedometer was difficult to calibrate, and continued to miscount steps, and therefore distance, covered.

It is made of plastic, and came unclipped easily.

I am a big person, and have started walking to improve my health. This product does not work for me, although it might be a different story for a slim person.

It has been relegated to the junk drawer, and probably will eventually be thrown away. I'll have to find another that works better and purchase it

Initially, the 340 was way too sensitive to be even remotely accurate. It did, however, give my wife a good laugh; she was sure that at least 5000 of my 10000 'steps' were registered while sitting perfectly still and clicking the TV remote. But after one week of use, the darn thing became so *in*sensitive that it would only register when I jumped up and down like a pogo stick. Pass on this one

I gave this pedometer one star because it is not for anyone who wants to use it straight off of the shelf.  This pedometer can work if you do not mind working on it.  It has problems that need modification.  

The top of the clip on this pedometer pushes against the body, making the vertical angle 20 degrees or more off of plumb.  That means the weighted arm inside drags on the circuit board and does not move freely.  Remove the factory clip and the tabs that hold it.  Add some adhesive Velchro to the back of the case.  Make a fabric band for your ankle.  Attach the ends to each other with Velchro.  Put a strip of Velchro on the outside of the band for attaching the pedometer to the band.  I get  accurate readings with this pedometer when it is attached to the inside of my right ankle.  I got inconsistent readings with it on my waistline.   

The hair spring that returns the weighted arm to its upright position weakened considerably after about ten miles and the pedometer drastically undercounted.  I opened the pedometer and added a strut to brace the spring.  The strut is made of thin brass.  Aluminum from a soda can would work, too.  I made a "V" in one end of the strut to hold the spring.  I pushed lightly against the spring from the left side, drilled a hole in the brass, and anchored the strut to a screw on the lower left part of the circuit board.  The strut angles up just slightly from the screw that anchors it.  I now have quite a few miles on the pedometer.  (I have a theory the spring weakened because its solder joint to the circuit board may have broken slightly and allowed the spring to twist freely.)

Several times the pedometer reset itself to "0" for no apparent reason.  I know nothing pushed on the reset button.  One incident was while it was going through the scanner at airport security.  Once it reset while I was walking.  Twice it reset while I was napping on the sofa.  I am thinking a charge of static electricity overwhelmed the circuit, but I do not know.  Static electricity from too many synthetic fabrics can be a problem with more expensive pedometers, too.  

This pedometer uses a counter circuit.  If someone needs an inexpensive electronic counter, connect a wire to the weighted arm and another wire to the coiled spring it contacts.  Connect a button switch to the two wires.  Freeze the weighted arm in place with hot glue

We bought our machine 2 weeks ago. It looks wonderful, nice sturdy, with alot of different features, but we haven't been able to use it. It didn't work from the day we brought it home and have been fighting with Ironman's Customer Service Department ever since. They keep giving us the runaround saying different technicians are coming but nobody ever shows up. Evertime we call their 1800 number we're on hold for at least 30 minutes before we even get to talk to a person and then they just lie and say they will either call us back or have someone out that day. Well after 2 weeks, we've had it! We're taking it back and never buying another Ironman product again. They're nice machines with good warrentys but what good is it if they won't get anyone out there to fix it? Nothing against the store, they've been great. Just 2 big thumbs down for the manufacturer

The first time I used these push-up bars the flimsy plastic they're made out of cracked in three different places.  Perhaps they will still hold up and not fail entirely, but I'm not going to risk an injury finding out.  In the trash they go... I suggest you buy some that are made out of metal tubing

This does not fit on Super 9 rifles as far as I know.  Besides, it first off has a too high zoom and also is tiny! (Most scopes are whatever zoom X30. For example, I own a 3-9X44 scope. This means it is adjustable from 3 to 9 times zoom.  The second number refers to the size of the scope lens.  I'd seriously reccomend a 3X30 if you can get one.  Also make sure it's dovetail if its for the super9 otherwise make sure it is a weaver rail.  If you are getting it for the Super 9 do not forget to unscrew the rear sight (peephole)

I purchased this bike rack because I was moving out of state and didn't have enough room in the back of my car for the bike.  
I also needed a rack to transport my bike to local trails, parks, etc.  So, I went with Schwinn given the brand name and that it was relatively inexpensive.  

I drove from NC to Fla, approx 700 miles, bad idea with this rack.  I didn't have any trouble assembling the rack, only took about 5 minutes and was ready to go.  However, during my trip, I had to pull over on the side of the interstate no less than 5 times to tighten the straps back.  The buckles do NOT hold the straps in place.  This is a real problem if you are travelling on a highway (or any busy road) and you have to worry about your bike flying off the back into oncoming traffic.  Also, even if the buckles hold, The wind drag from the bike starts to pull the brackets right off of the rack frame.  I had to purchase 4 bungee cords and rope in order to secure my bike from flying off the back (and yes, the rack was assembled correctly).  Bottom line, this rack is probably a great value if don't plan on driving more than a a few miles or over 40-50mph, otherwise, it is a a complete waste.

I bought this model a year ago, and replaced the deck after approximately 8 months.  Just recently, the deck cracked again.  Of course the warrantly no longer applies.  Save yourself the headache of dealing with this company and spend a little extra to upgrade to a better brand.

I ordered two of these to save on shipping and figured the extra tube would be good for relube in another year or two.  After applying one vial, it seemed even worse than before.  (Tread "catches" as I walk.)  So I applied the second vial just to make it usuable.  (Still not great.)  This stuff is overpriced and either they don't give you enough or it's poor quality

I bought the set in a rush without reading the reviews, big mistake! The Cardio Boot Camp is missing which makes the prescribed program not work as the workout that you need for week 2 and 3 is missing.  The beginner boot camp is boring though the advanced is challenging fun.  If I knew what wasn't included I wouldn't have bought it.  They should list what's not included in the description.  It seems somewhat deceptive

This is the biggest joke on the planet. No doubt, it is scary, but c'mon people. I guess it's to scare the sh*t out of you.
My comment has to be the first serious review that has been made for this item. 
Think about it . . . the toilet. One of the best places for germs. And you want to attach some rubber device to it.
I'll do you one better, and you'll get just as good a laugh from it. (Also, it'll be a lot cheaper)
Go buy a roll of Saran-Wrap. Cling it tightly to the top of the toilet bowl. Wait and watch as your guest visit the bathroom to use it.
I don't think no one will die from this type of trick

I consider my dogs to be small - they are all around 25 pounds.  I have had to tighten everything on the backpack to keep them from being too loose and I still feel like they are a little bit too big.  I think that for a "small" backpack, that they are just too large.  Thank you

I returned this item, as it didn't fit my 19-pound Boston Terrier well at all. It was way too large for his body. "Small" obviously means small for a larger dog instead. Just be aware!

I bought this hoping it would be a cheap and easy way to do crunches in the living room while watching TV...

I wondered how the thing worked since the pictures and blurb are less than descriptive.  What it boils down to is that this is a "foot hook" tied to a bar with a nylon strap.  The nylon strap is cheap and appears that it will wear quickly.  The idea is you hook the bar under a closed door then do sit-ups/crunches...the problem is that the nylon strap doesn't actually hold your feet down.  I wanted a product that would hold my feet down and allow me to use it in the middle of the room.  Negative on both accounts.  You need a good sturdy door to implement this product, and then it still doesn't truly hold your feet down.  

Looks like I'll break down and buy one of the bars that actually clamps to the bottom of a door to hold your feet down

Rechargeable flashlights are a sensational idea - an essential part of any family's emergency kit (and ecologically smart to boot). While this product is satisfactory for, say, a science demonsration on the Faraday Principle, its usefulness as a flashlight is considerably more limited. 

To its credit: This flashlight was meant to last, and will stand extremes of water and temperature. When dropped into water, it will float beam-side up for easy retrieval. It's so sturdy tha, it will likely last for the lifetime of the user - and you can't say that about too many products. 

Shake this light for a while, and a disk of rare earth conducts enough current to sustain a light for a small amount of time. While you may read claims of up to one or two hours, a faint but workable current only lasts for about ten minutes, and then you shake again. And again. As long as you don't mind the repetition, the wan stream of bluish light will serve your purposes in a blackout or some other emergency. But don't entertain thoughts that you'll be able to read, find small objects, or perform any kind of detail work.

If you don't have a chance to compare this to its better competition, you might not know that say, the Sherpa Xray offers a well-focused beam you can read by. While no rechargeable can give you the kind of illumination you'll find in a traditional flashlight, your options are brighter if you stay away from the Diamond Gen. Invest in something more powerful and you'll find that a flashlight's usefulness becomes considerably greater. 

This flashlight was disappointing, and useless in any practical context

EVERLIFE IS LITTLELIGHT, November 22, 2005
Reviewer:	AGNAZZO (Tampa, Florida United States) - See all my reviews
LIVING IN FLORIDA I BOUGHT TWO OF THESE EVERLIFE FLASHLIGHTS. THE PARTY THAT SAID THAT THESE FLASHLIGHTS ARE CHARGED UP DURING SHIPPING IS SUFFERING FROM SHAKING OF THE HEAD. IT TAKES AT LEAST A MINUTE OF SHAKING AFTER DELIVERY BEFORE THE FLASHLIGHT IS GIVING OUT ITS MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF LIGHT WHICH IS VERY LOW. AFTER THAT TO KEEP IT OPERATING MORE SHAKING IS IN ORDER. THE ILLUMINATION WHICH IS VERY LOW COMPARED TO OTHER BATTERY FLASHIGHTS DIES OUT VERY RAPIDLY AND NEED ADDITIONAL SHAKING TO KEEP IT GOING. THIS FLASHLIHGT TO BE FAIR MAY COME IN HANDY DURING A HURRICANE POWER FAILURE. LED FLASHLIGHTS THAT USE BATTERIES ARE FAR SUPERIOR TO THESE SHAKING FLASHLIGHTS.THE BATTERIES LAST A VERY LONG TIME DUE TO THE LOW POWER THAT LEDS OPERATE AT

The wood is very nice - but the design/ manufacturing is very poor.

My experience trying to assemble this rack was frustrating.  The holes aren't properly pre-drilled.  The hole at the top didn't match up with the cap-plate hole, which A) made it very difficult to screw together (the first screw stripped) and B) resulted in a gap and wobbly finally assembly.  I experienced the same issue with shallow pre-drilled holes in the bottom, and the bolts not going in all the way. 

I never got to the point of figuring out the cryptic finally assembly instructions.  Based on the wobbly central column, I decided to disassemble mine and send it back.

When I was assembling this product I discovered that not only were the instructions vague, and that the product pictured did not appropriately match the product given, but that the product itself was sloppily manufactured.  The predrilled holes were only half the depths that the instructions required them to be in order to properly assemble and adjust the final height.  My thought is... How hard is it to drill a hole to a proper depth?

Luckily I own the tools necessary to fix their mistakes, but how much money are they really saving by inconveniencing their customers?

I wish I could give this product a higher rating, but hopefully there are better alternatives

I bought these skates last year, with the plans of putting outdoor wheels on them.  When I tried to take the wheels off, they wouldn't budge!  Spend the extra $50 on a pair of quality skates that you can keep for years.  When the  *indoor* wheels on these die, the skates die too.  These most definitely are not roller derby skates, since those girls change their wheels all the time!

I bought these skates for my daughter from Sport Authority.  Since we both wear the same size, I decided I would try and skate in them after my daughter.  She complained the wheels would not roll and when I tried to loosen them with a skate tool, they wouldn't loosen at all.  I tried to skate in them as well and I almost fell on my face.  I wasn't expecting the same quality as my professional skates, but at least hoped for skates that rolled safely!

I am a HUGE ski person and I got the jump it is so small for me because I am do like 50 feet drops all the time.
___________________MY SUGGESTION___________________

This is good for you starting your kid out on there first scooter they got for the holidays or skate board what ever you get him and its good for those things. Not Ideal what so ever for skiing. I got it to practice low ground tricks like a 180 at least so go for it if you are doing it for your son or daughter with there first scooter or bike or skateboard NOT skiing

There was no indication prior to purchase that the ramp would need to be secured to another surface thru nails or bolts. My son saved up to buy this thinking he could use it on a sidewalk or road. He could not. It is too light to maintain any stability without being fastened to another surface

this ramp is terribly designed for a skateboard. First of all, i thought this would be a bit larger. When i tried to go off of the ramp, my nose hit the front of it. 
Not only is it not fun, but you need to weigh it down if you dont want to slide around. If you are considering purchasing this item for use with a skateboard,i recommend something else.

Not very bright for an LED.  AND, guess what? This is about 2 1/2 inches long if it is standing on its tippy-toes!
Given the picture shows a spike on it, one could have the impression that it is big enough to spike into the ground and mark a trail or something... well, the spike is more like a thumbtack.
I realize the images are provided by the manufacturer, so I don't blame Amazon - but there is NO excuse for not accurately listing the actual size of this.

I got four boxes of these matches so I was motivated to learn how to use them.  I had read the directions about poking them into the lid.  I tried stroking and poking at various angles and finally got one to light after about 10 minutes.  It burned down to the wood portion and went out.  Incidentally, these matches are very short. Perhaps one is supposed to light them with a lighter

 I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son's airsoft rifle as a Christmas gift. The screws were too short to attach it to his Kitty Kat ( a shortened M-4) airsoft rifle's weaver rail. Yes, I could go out and find screws the proper length, but I though I'd make Airsplat do their job. 

So, after several e-mails with the service department, they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size. Wrong. The diameter of the new screws is so big they won't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight. Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws. 

Why by a gun from these guys? If it arrives broken, you pay to ship it back. Want a refund? You pay a 15% restocking fee. Take a pass on Airsplat.

The title pretty much says it all.  The bag is solid and didn't get too soft even after a good amount of use.  The big downside is that the metal clasps that are used to hang up the bag are of extremely poor quality and can't support the weight of the bag. One of the clasps actually broke in two and two of the others became bent beyond usability.  All within about six months of use.  Unless you're prepared to spot weld the clasps to reinforce them I'd look elsewhere for a heavy bag.

I was so frustrated with those so called "sticky mats", my hands would slide forward in simple poses like downward facing dog. 
So I decided to give the $50 skidless yoga towel a try.
This worked pretty well for my slipping hands, but i had a new problem.  I was unable to get traction for my feet and felt as though they would slip up when in many of the commonly practiced poses in yoga.  (downward facing dog, even poses like triangle and extended side angle).  I really tried giving this towel a chance but ended up purchasing a harmony yoga mat (those rubber mats) which greatly reduced my slippery yoga experiences.
I would not recommend the skidless towel for your entire mat, maybe you may have better luck with just the hand towel.
I realized with yoga mats that every person is different, so what doesn't work for me, may work for you.  I just thought I would give my 2 cents

I bought the CycleOps Wind Indoor Trainer to train at home when I can't hit the road because of work (or weather) complications. If you are like me that means weekdays late at night, or very early in the morning. 

I'm terribly frustrated because I can't use it due to the unbearable noise the fan flywheel makes. My neighbors can't stand it. Hey, I can't stand it! The noise level is comparable to an industrial vacuum cleaner. To give you an idea, I don't even hear the music from my iPod while riding this thing. 

Don't buy it! Go for the magnetic resistance models.

For $20 this looked like it could be a nice light radio for walking/jogging, with a bonus pedometer.  The radio has no channel display, and the only setting is a reset button to go the bottom of the dial, then a scan button.  When walking, it loses the station occasionally - luckily my prefered station is at the bottom of the dial, but if yours isn't this could be terribly annoying.  As for the pedometer, it jumps by 10 steps just from clipping it on my waistband, and several times went zooming thru 20 or 30 steps when I was holding it perfectly still - thus worthless.  I'm sending it back

I'm a big fan of Topeak's gear. I own two of their racks, couple of pumps, bags, etc. I use the MTX trunk bag/panniers to commute, and I live in Florida so I needed rain cover. I purchased this, and to my surprise----Topeak failed to include a strap for a rear blinkie. Yes, the cover is yellow. Yes, there's a reflective triangle. But that's not the same as a blinkie. Gee, Topeak, do you think people might want to run a blinkie in the rain? Stupid lack of planning.

This software is completely useless with an explorist gps unit.  I am sending the gps i just purchased, along with this software, back to amazon.  The software will not communicate with the gps, and the company will not respond to any of my support requests, the web page has none of the patches that are supposed to be available, and the live technical support is a complete joke.  After 20 minutes of being on hold, I spoke with a gentleman that barely spoke english, and offered me no help... I knew more about the software than him, and i've only owned it 3 days.  I'll never purchase from Magellan again

Overall poor quality in craftsmanship. One can clearly see the glue that holds the gold trim in place, and on mine the trim on the handles was loose and could be easily removed. The wood is of subpar quality as well. The price is low; however, I would not recommend these swords

Please don't waste your hard earned money on this awful toy. It is tiny! The "hinges" and lock had worn marks on the plastic even before opening the product so you know they will break off soon. The "jewels" never sink, either.

Interestingly, PoolToy doesn't list the size of this product. In fact they don't give much information at all which is very misleading and disappointing. What a rip off. I hope Amazon discontinues its association with this company. Look at the feedback record for them. It's as terrible as this toy is

If you order this sword, you may not get what you see. Yes you will get the same 'style' of sword, but as for the look, forget it, the steel is pure black. Now if that's what you want great, I personally wanted the 'silver' steel look, but got the 'jet black' steel. Don't worry, it was the same sword, just a different color.

Expedited shipping was erroneously entered for this order. Tried to change and then cancel it minutes after entry and repeatedly until it came to no avail.  Refused package a month ago.  Exorbitant charge made to my credit card and I will have to seek resolution with them, since Amazon takes no responsibility.  Vendor has not responded to over 20 calls and emails to cancel/refund order.

AMAZON PLACES ORDERS WITH SKETCHY VENDORS LIKE THIS AND THEN YOU'RE STUCK WITH ERRONEOUS CHARGES.  BEWARE!!

Amazon has the brand mislabeled as Apex, but it is Ipex. Cardboard box arrived spilt open and plastic carrying case was cracked--obviously it was never intended to hold so much weight. The rubber handles are very hard and already coming apart. The "chrome" paint is already peeling before even one use. Also, buyers should be aware that you can only increase the weight in 5lb increments, and if you plan on using both dumbbells at the same time, the maximum weight on each is 15lbs (If i would have thought about it, when I purchased it I would have realized both of these). Overall very poor quality. I will try to return

Although they claim that this item can be used by adults, it is the furthest thing from the truth.  You can only fill the black bottom HALF up with water, which you wouldn't know until you buy it.  Due to this, you can't do any combonations with this bag as you knock on its' side with even the most mild of punches. Also, after a few hits, it rips open like your fists were made of nails even with gloves on.  

The only reason why this purchase was made was due to the fact that I have no where to hang my actual heavybag in my apartment. This is not even remotely a replacment for a real bag.  Save your twenty five dollars for something else

I bought this for our camping trip to the Bonnaroo music festival in Tennessee.  The valve on this matress has a little flap on the inside that is supposed to stop air from coming out while you're securing the screw-on valve.  Unfortunatly, the design of the pump is such that you have a plastic nozzle that pushes the flap back to far to shut properly.

What this means is that you pump it up nice and firm, but the flap does not properly prevent air from escaping while you secure the valve cover. So you end up with not nearly as firm a matress as you would otherwise have.  

I will say that the mattress did stay at the the less than firm inflation point while we slept on it overnight, and the pump was robust and quick. However, the valve flap problem is serious enough that I am returning the product

Works as advertised, except...  One of the attachment straps broke the 3rd day.  No particular stress applied or anything.  I'm going to Allen to see if I can get a replacement.  

That was my only complaint.  Otherwise, it's fine.  Then again, breaking on the 3rd use is a big complaint

     The frame seems to be the only thing of any quality on this bike.  I have owned this for three months so far and have had to replace the shifter, derailer, brakes and other small items.  This bike is NOT Schwinn's usual quality.  Very disapointin

If you just like the cruiser look and will use the bike only occasionally for very short rides (less than 10 miles) then this is probably not a bad bike. BUT, if you want a much more comfortable and efficient bike, and one that will fit your body properly, go to your local bike shop and ask to see their "hybrid" bikes. This type of bike gets its name from being a cross between a "road bike" and a "mountain bike" or "all terrain" bike. They are available in several frame sizes, so you're not stuck with "one-size-fits-all", which is NOT good if you are shorter than about 5'7 or taller than about 5'10. Hybrids are available in a wide range of prices and equipment selections. The price will range from just over $200 to as high as you want to go (over $1500 anyway). As the price goes up, the weight generally goes down and the quality of the frame and all components goes way up. But even at the low end of the scale, a hybrid will be a much more efficient bike to ride (more miles covered per energy expended) and it will be more comfortable on longer rides (over 10 miles). If you are truly interested in covering some longer distances (up to maybe 30-40 miles) focus on the models that feature 700C wheels as opposed to 26-inch--your bike shop person can explain--and keep the tire width down to 35mm or under (28mm is a good size for most people if they ride only on pavement). The narrower tires offer less "rolling resistance" making the bike easier to pedal and the larger wheel sizes improves efficiency a little also.

Happy peddaling,
A VERY experienced cyclis

though i can say the item was nice when i got it

This compass handles very poorly compared to other manufacturers.  The pin for the lid is cheap and the hing will likely break.  The card (actual compass part that spins) wobbles a lot so it's difficult to get an exact bearing.  It is like the oil in the compass is very thin.  Also, the direction line lid spins easily, making it possible to take a bad reading.  Ironically, this is the Silva weakness as well.


If you need an inexpensive engineer style compass, consider the Silva.  For a two more dollars, you get an aluminum case, a hinge that won't break and a card that doesn't wobble with the slightest hand movement

I was tired of the rental skates and wanted to be able to zip around the floor with my kids at the skating rink.  So I bought these skates.  At the time, it felt a little impulsive to spend so much on skates.  Well, now I know I should have spent more and at least be happy with what I purchased.

I had such a hard time skating with these skates, and when I talked to the guy at the pro shop and 2 people online (there are a lot of resources online-do a search for quad skates) I realized these skates were made for beginning kids, never a 36 year old mom!  They are not made to do the kind of things on the floor you think you might be able to do.  In fact, I couldn't even turn.  I kept having to push off because they would slow down.  I kept adjusting them and had a professional at the rink adjust them for me, and forget it!  I'm selling them at the resale shop and spending more money to at least get something decent

I think they are too stiff for comfort.  I do like the short finger, but the material over the back of the hand is too stiff. I thought it would stretch out and soften a bit. But it hasn't.  Protects the hands well through off road trails though.

This gun was okay when I first started using it. It's really a backyard gun, and should only be used for beginners. I had it on my bed, which is about two feet high, and it fell when my dog jumped on, the barrel broke. The spring in the magazine also broke. There are better guns out there, but if you just want to have some good clean fun in your backyard, this is the gun for you. The sight is a pretty nice feature.

Let me first say that I did not purchase this mini stepper through Amazon, but rather directly from the Discovery Channel Store. Two weeks after I submitted my review of their product on their web site, however, they still have not seen fit to post it.

I used the Discovery Electronic Mini Stepper daily for 29 days (30 minutes per day) before the cable around the pulley-wheel broke. This seems to be a consistent problem with this piece of equipment, judging by previous reviews on the DCS (Discover Channel Store) web site. Being inside the 30 day return window, I sent my stepper back for a refund. Customer service, I must say, was excellent...only the product itself was cheap and substandard.

On a related note, this is the third mini stepper (various brands, not all DCS) I have owned in the past year. They have all broken down in one way or another. Feel free to look at some of my previous reviews here to get the details, but the bottom line is that this will be my last mini stepper.

Take some advice from me when I say that these machines are built for people who are beginners in the world of fitness. That is to say, if you intend to use a mini stepper two or three days per week for 15-20 minutes, then you may be satisfied with one. However, if you are at an advanced or even intermediate stage in your workout routine, then don't even consider one of these machines - you will destroy it, trust me. There's just too much that can go wrong -- pulleys cracking, pulley cables breaking, shocks leaking...and I actually broke the frame of one stepper. Through all of this, I have learned one important lesson about exercise: keep it simple. I am now having great success with some simple resistance bands (many varieties are available here at Amazon) and cardiovascular exercises (e.g. regular old jumping-jacks). I get a better workout than any I ever got from a mini stepper, and I'm feeling great and even lost a little weight in the right places :-)

Honestly, if you want to save yourself some grief, please learn from my experiences and avoid the horrible cycle of mini stepper destruction. Just buy yourself some resistance bands, maybe a jump rope, an exercise mat, an instructional video/book, and then get to work. Exercising to tone your body and lose weight isn't easy (and if it is, then you're probably not doing it right), but you can make it easier by not wasting your time and money on junk like this

For all of the supposed 'resistance' built into this machine, it enables you to do  many -more- repetitions than you'd be able to do  of simple bodyweight 'core' exercises,(crunches, leg lifts, situps, and a multitude of others). Why is that, and what is the effect? 1/ Why : The resistance is -less- than the resistance supplied by the weight of your own body being moved around without any equipment. The so-called 'resistance' actually -assists- you on the return motion, the exact opposite of exercise.2/The Effect: You must do an incredibly high number of repetitions do get any effect at all, and it won't be much even then. High rep work should be full-body cardio , not isolated ab work. Ab work should be the same as any other muscle-building work : After you can do 15 reps , the resistance should be raised: Exercising the abs, obliques, other core muscles  to strengthen and build them. If an exercise doesn't get difficult enough to make you stop after a minute or so, it simply isn't difficult enough to do you any good. There is no such thing as spot reducing exercise. Modern ads know better than to claim the lie of spot-reduction, but they still strongly imply it. Why do they get away with it? : Because people never stop looking for an easy way out. The re-sale value of these gizmos goes down to around 5 bucks as soon as you own it. Why? : Because the market is flooded with as-seen-on-tv, home-exercise junk that's collecting dust

I am waking up during the night reinflating this thing and after an hour it is back to being deflated.  Don't waste your money like I did

The Brunton Nexus Star is a low-cost, fairly rugged, basic compass.  Like any low-cost compass, if you know how to use it you can get where you want to go, but it lacks features you may later wish you had.  On the plus side, it is lightweight, inexpensive, and fairly thin, so it doesn't take up a lot of room in your pocket.  On the minus side, the baseplate is very short, so it is harder to use with a map and a little less accurate when reading a bearing.  The biggest disadvantage, in my opinion, is that it doesn't have a true declination adjustment; it is advertised as having a "declination scale" which is not the same.  On a baseplate compass, you take a bearing by lining up the compass needle inside the North Reference Indicator (sometimes called the "Doghouse") etched on the bottom of the vial.  Compasses with true declination adjustment allow you to rotate this "Doghouse" to align it with the desired declination.  That way you always read a bearing by aligning the needle inside the Doghouse.  On the Nexus Star, however, you can't do this.  Instead, you have to remember to line up the compass needle with the point on the scale that corresponds to the local declination.  In this case, the needle is not boxed inside the doghouse, and I find it can lead to errors, especially when you are tired and not thinking clearly after a long hike.  If you always navigate using magnetic bearings rather than true bearings, this isn't a problem.

I can recommend this compass for use with a GPS receiver that is set to read magnetic bearings, and it is suitable as a back-up compass.  I also regularly use it as an inexpensive tool to teach students in my GPS classes how to use a compass, but I wouldn't recommend it for serious work

I threw this away yesterday (3.30.7) First of all, it's too cheaply designed and manufactured to stop anything as heavy as a door. The tin plate on it fell off last week and no one even broke into my home. I went to my local hardware store and purchased a solid steel 'Collins Axe #4 (wood) Splitting Wedge' to replace it. I bought a tube of Hard As Nail Heavy Duty contruction Adhesive and affixed some rubber to one side of the wedge to prevent slippage. Now that's the way a door wedge should be! Don't waste your money on this cheap Chinese garbage called the 'Super Door Stop Alarm'! Make your own right here in the USA

This ball is radio controlled with a remote that is about the size of a small cell phone. The ball has two small holes (smaller than the size of a dimple) on opposite sides that connect to a battery operated charger (2 AA). The remote uses a 9V battery. The ball has a small internal battery that apparently can be replaced if needed once it can longer hold a charge. The ball can be operated for a couple of minutes after a charge. 

The ball is not meant to be hit, but probably can withstand a putter hit from a short distance. Because of a rolling weight and circuitry within the otherwise hollow ball, the ball does not roll straight on its own. The ball looks somewhat like a real ball but has a slightly off-white color and has an obvious seam. 

When using the remote to control the ball, the ball revs up for 2-3 seconds by making a rattling sound, then it takes off still rattling away. An arrow on the ball is present to let you know the initial direction the ball will roll. You can reverse the ball's direction, but you can't make it go left or right.

The two biggest drawbacks of this gag ball are:
1. You can only direct the ball in two directions (front - back) with the remote.
2. A fairly loud rattling noise is made by the ball that probably can be heard from about 20 yards away.

As a gag ball, it seems like it is of only limited use. But for about $10, what more can I expect

The 'blue' body ball that was sent to me was not blue. It's white with some blue print. The pump didn't work right so I used a rocket type pump that came with a ball I had purchased from another company. Plugs and pumps seem to be interchangeable. The quality of the 'blue' ball is good. When I opened the box it looked like the ball was the wrong size but it expands to the 65cm. My first thought was wrong color, wrong size. No inflation directions enclosed in box only an excercise chart. Ball is OK, pump is not. I was not happy but didn't want the return hassle. If you aren't fussy about color and have a back-up pump, go for it.

My Daughter is 38" and about 30lbs.  It's the perfect size for her.  We mainly use it as something to lay on while watching TV or reading books on the floor. 

PROS
- When in the "chair position", it's tall enough to accommodate taller children.
- Cover is removeable and washable
- Comes with handy pink storage bag (although it's kinda hard to fit the pump in the bag along with the bed)
- Pretty easy to convert into chair (there are 2 straps on each side of the bed that need to be "connected" in order to change it into chair - they are color coded).  Might be hard for young children to figure out how to do it.
- Inside of sleep bag is made of soft material (although it appears as though it may snag easily).
- Large zipper located on one side of the sleep bag.  Easy for small hands to use.
- Weight limit: 100 lbs


CONS
- The Pump is VERY cheaply made and it takes a long time to inflate the bed (it operates by use of foot motion or you can use your hands).
- The air slowly leaks out of the bed.  We actually thought ours had a hole in it when purchased, so we exchanged for another one.  But this one too deflates pretty quickly.  Example: if we completely inflate at 7pm, by 8am the next morning it needs to be inflated again because it loses about 40% of it's air.
- Adult help is needed to change into chair.
- Adult help is needed to inflate.

OVERALL: It's a bit pricey for the quality I was expecting.  It would be nice if adult assistance wasn't needed to change from bed to chair and back.  Defitely would work as an extra sleeping spot for the night, but it takes along time to inflate and requires an adult to do so

Bought it 2 months ago for in-door usage, thought it'd last until the end of the semester.
After less than a couple of weeks of normal everyday usage, punctures started to appear, and the patches that came along with the package didn't help much.
Even though the design and the built-in manual pump is a big plus, the quality is very disappointing

Just like once in a while even a blind squirrel finds a chestnut.....once in a while Amazon gets it right!  Had a very bad experience before Christmas when ordering a gift for my daughter.  After being scared into spending extra on next day shipping 2 weeks prior to Christmas....on an "IN STOCK" item,  5 days prior to Christmas, I was notified that item was OUT OF STOCK and I wouldn't receive it...PANIC MODE!  I sent an unsolicited E-Mail complaint to Amazon.  My response was pretty much  sorry, but Amazon has no control over items that they essentially broker, and don't actually inventory.....WHAT!      I noticed that they didn't ask for a review of my experience on that one!!   But my son did get his B-Ball this time....and if it wasn't for him, I would have never done business with Amazon again! This review probably doesn't meet the guidelines and undoubtedly won't be posted

 I just read an article at the Fox sports website saying it is almost certain that NBA will go back to using leather ball.
 There will not even be a bragging right once this officially happens, so in my opinion, don't buy it

Ok, i REALLY thought this ball would be GREAT considering the overinflated price and since it is endorsed by the NBA.  NOT SO!  This ball feels very similar to the cheap $20 balls you can get at your local department stores!    Feels similar to the Wilson NCAA solution game ball, but slightly less tacky, but since it has to be pumped up so much inorder for it to actually bounce it feels almost like rubber.  I personally do not like that.  This ball is supposed to be able to be played out of the box, without a break in period.  Well, i hope it gets to feeling better over time, but since it supposedly has not break in period, i am very skeptical.  I honestly do not feel the "crosstraxxion" design does anything to improve the the feel or grip of the ball.  If you like the feel of leather, this is NOT for you.  I am NOT impressed!  Search for reviews for this ball before purchasing!  The only thing you can do with this ball that you can't do with others, is say "Well at least this is the Official Game Ball the pros use!"

This bokken is only for looks and not hitting ant thing I used it for less than five mintues and broke. It has a nice look and feels good but does have blemishesand. Also say if you accidentally hit something even a little hard it breaks. The company does a lousey job of wrapping the sword too. The barcode sticker failed to come off in one piece and I ended ripping off some of the finish of the burgundy version of this bokken. I spar with my friends all the time and would have to recommend the bokkens from karate depot instead of this inadequate piece of whatsit. Anyone,honestly, that tells you differently is wrong

I am in the same boat...stupid..I should have read the comments before bidding on ebay and getting ripped off first on price..I paid about $45 on ebay...and then it came stright from Amazon and NO DVD...I called cust service and all they could tell me is to send it back and get a refund...what a pain...I told them to use photo shop and crop out the picture of the dvd...false advertising...oh well live and learn...ball does seem pretty small once I aired it up...I think I will look else where for a differnt name brand ball.  And yes it takes like 30 min of pumping to get it blowed up and its a huge work out..arms hurt etc

I was also disappointed that the product came without a DVD, though the initial description said so. But Amazon has given me the refund of the whole purchase price. Appreciate their gesture. 

Agree with previous reviewer that the pump is really hard to work with. It took a *lot* of time to get the ball inflated and the pump got hot meanwhile.

Yeah, not very happy with this product.

p.s: Contrastingly, had a bad experience with Dell on a similar situation when I bought a Nikon camera. Dell blamed the wrong description on Nikon and expectedly, Nikon blamed Dell. Neither owned up the error. But Amazon was pretty good. I really appreciate it

...intentional rip off?

There is no 50 minute work out DVD included. The pump included does not work (after pumping air for 20 minutes straight doesn't even put a dent on the deflated ball) and becomes very hot after a while. I kept thinking the plastic pump is going to melt before the ball enflates (if ever). The "65cm" ball turns out to be only "55cm."

I don't know... seems like a rip off to me, but amazon is not at fault, since the Nautlius web site has the exact same description for the item.

Quality-wise, the TKO Cory Everson Fitness Ball 55cm I got a while back was so much better. The plastic isn't so sticky, and it felt a lot more durable than the Nautlius one, too

My son has had this pogo stick for about a year and has not been able to play on it because the spring is too stiff and does not compress easily.  Even my daughter who weighs 70 lbs cannot get it to work.  Our 11 year old neighbour who has her own pogo stick had no problems, but it is not for the beginner

I just received this toy today in the mail and it was a total bust.  I gave it to my 14 month old daughter and she handed it back to me.  They legs that are supposed to make the music are hard to push and she can not do it herself.  I only paid 5.29 for it with free shipping so I can't complain.  At least My 3 month old likes to look at it.  I would not recommend buying this toy

This poker set is the cheapest quality there is.  For the price, I kind of expected a lesser quality product but not this bad!  The chips are plastic with a metal insert.  The chip edge is sharp and there are a lot of imperfections on the chip like dirt was mixed in it.  Furthermore, the thickness of the chips are UNEVEN.  Therefore, when you stack the chips (depending on the color), 5 white chips may be shorter than 5 black chips.  The poker case handle broke the first time I lifted it.  The chip dividers are loose and the felt material is not glued in properly.  This is really a bad product which should be banned from Amazon.  

Save yourself some grief.  Spend a little more money and buy a reputable poker set!  What a waste of time and money

I bought this bike thinking since Jeep put its name on it then it should be a great, tough, rock solid ride! Boy was I wrong! Not only the bike feels cheap and extremely heavy, its mechanics are worst part. After taking it to a bike shop to get it tuned professionally, 10 of its gears still don't work. Now you may say well the mechanic did a quick crappy job, let me tell ya, I stood by the guy as he worked on it for 2 hours yet the gears still didn't work. Overall, I'd have to give this bike two thumbs down. You're better off buying a bike from walmart

I thought this would be the ultimate gym bag. The main compartment is too narrow. Your shoes will not fit side by side, you have to stack them. The pockets do not expand wide enough and are not deep enough. The zippers are cheap and stick. It is very pretty but not very functional. My $16.00 bag works much better.

Field in a bag claims to be "the perfect way to get a baseball game going".  While this may be true, the number of games you can actually play with this set will be ONE (if the set even makes it through the game).
First off, with these bases you must set up the field using the wooden mallet the pound a flimsy plastic stake into the ground.  With one of my sets (I bought 3 unfortunatly at the same time not knowing their reputation), the wooden mallet wasn't even glued together, it had fallen apart so I had to just use the head.  Then when I put the stakes into the ground, out of the 3 sets I had, at least 1 in each set broke while I was placing them.
To actually place the bases, the set gives you a string device that helps you measure out the field.  This was handy except for the fact that it took me 10 min to untangle the mess and then when I went to second base realized the string was not long enough.  Granted, one could place 1st and 3rd and then figure out where 2nd went but the picture in the set-up shows that the string will measure the base; however, it definintely is not the right length.
After placing the bases the team is now ready to play.  However, don't wear cleats with these bases.  The bottom of the base says, not recommended for use with cleats and boy were they right!  With our game we had tball children using the bases and even their little cleats  (and not all the kids had cleats) tore them to shreds.
Our bases lasted about one hour before they were torn and the inside cotton coming out.  It was very unfortunate seeing as though we purchased three sets and all were done by the end of an hour.  This non-profit won't see that money again :)

So unless you plan on using these bases on the grass for easy set-up, do not plan on wearing cleats, and not playing a true game of baseball/softball....you would probably be better off buying the $8 flat bases for temporary use (and they can be left outside afterward too).

- Just not impressed, sorr

About average for the price, nothing particularly illuminating about this flashlight.  The wide beam is fairly faint, with a strong central spot.  This one will go out into the garage, and likely stay there.

Even though this is a receiver hitch mount item, it does not use a standard hitch pin.  It is a permanent attachment to the vehicle hitch (must be bolted into the hitch - to remove, must be unbolted).

This totally defeats the purpose of a receiver hitch - versatility: the ability to easily - without tools - change whatever is mounted in the hitch.

Bad Thule!  Bad

I bought this mat with the expectation that it would keep me from slipping, since I tend to sweat alot on my hands and feet. I was in for a big disappointment.  For the price that I paid compare to the other yoga mats, I was very disappointed.  Lesson learned, find a yoga store and shop in person rather than on-line.

For those of you who sweats alot, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING THIS MAT.

If you are sensitive to smells do not buy this mat. Seemed to fill the room with it's funk.

Does not grip well. I bought it for grip.

Yes, it's stable. Worth it? Not to me.

Try the hugger mugger earth elements mat(5mm model). It's got great grip and seems like a feather weight compared to this mat. Not as stable in place, but seems a better value(reasonable price). And it's biodegradable

Well, they looked so cool on TV that I ordered 2 of them and I regret it. It's awkward to get the hook back into the "rocket" once the bait is on. I took my son fishing with them and what we ended up doing is not launching them out of the gun/rod. We left the pod open with the bait on the hook and dropped it into the water and let it drift with the current. I've come to find that buying cheesey little rods and reels are simply a waste of money. If you're going to take a little one out fishing, just use your own and let them reel yours in until their big enough to handle a decent set up. The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because it was a neat IDEA. [...]

My first pedometer from Sportline worked only a few days (digital display completely disappeared), so I returned it to them, and after over two months and several emails from me to them, they replaced it with this Sportline 350.  The first two days, it worked fine, although it seemed to count many more steps than it should have.  The third day, in the middle of the day it said approx. 3400 steps, later that afternoon it said 1300 steps, and by nighttime the display totally disappeared, and never came back.  I just sent the second one back, and am expecting that again it will take several weeks and multiple emails to get the situation resolved with their slow customer service.  Their products seem to be very poorly made, and I don't expect to purchase any more.... after reading the reviews, I have just purchased an Omron, and am hoping it will be much more reliable

The pedometer worked great for the first two weeks. Than my 1 1/2 year old snatched it off my jeans, it fell on the tile floor and broke the casing of it. It still worked, but I had to be careful when I opened it because the back was broken and no longer attached. Last w/e it stopped working completely. Everthing is set to 0 and won't move. My husbands odometer seems to be working fine. However, I'm dissapointed for the short life-span....

I thought this was great at first until I realized that it works sporadically. I can get up in the morning and walk all over the house, look down and check my Sportline to find it is still registered at 0 steps. Other times I can walk a mile or more and find it recorded maybe 20 steps. One of the problems with it is its shape. Unlike some pedometers (like Omron) that are a vertical oval-shape, the Sportline is a horizontal rectangle, which makes it easily roll with the waistline of your pants or skirt. It's important for a pedometer to be perpendicular to the ground for it to record accurately. After much frustration, I finally bought an Omron pedometer which I love. Unfortunately, this Sportline model is so inconsistent and inaccurate as to be useless.

I ordered 2 of these pedometers and neither of them count steps accurately.  One only counts about half the steps I take and the other is usually 2500 steps behind that.  I wore them both for a week and got the same results everyday.  I could understand if one didn't work properly but I got 2 at the same time with the same problem.  I would not recommend this product

This light worked for me when I used two D-batteries, but that was a lucky guess as the light did not come with instructions. I was also unaware that the light was fender mount, and wasn't happy about the idea of drilling a hole in my fender just for the light. I found that replacing the front  reflector with the light worked OK for me, and this replacement was easy on the cruiser I have. My main complaint for this product is the lack of description on the internet, and the missing installation instructions

I ordered two of these with high hopes, to be utterly disappointed.

First the design of the battery holders is bad. They are supposed to hold two C cell batteries. When I tried to get one in, I initially concluded that a different size must be requried, as it seemed the C size wouldn't fit. After much futzing around, I managed to get two C cells in without hopelessly bending the flimsy contact springs. This one now works but I doubt that I could successfully remove and replace the batteries again. The battery holder is too flimsy. On the second unit the contact wire which connects the two far ends of the batteries had fallen out of its plastic holder. After 15 minutes of trying to put it back I gave up. This unit is totally unusable. Nothing on the Pyramid package label indicates that two batteries, C cell size, are needed but not included.

Second this is a fender mount light, meaning if you want to mount it to your handlebar there's no way to do that with the hardware included. While the Pyramid box does say "Fender Mount," that description was not included in the online product description. And, this light with batteries installed is fairly heavy. The lightweight plastic fender on my front bike tire would not come close to supporting this light, and I doubt that many bike fenders these days would. Why would anyone sell this as a bike headlight without including a handlebar mount??

I'm totally disgusted with this flimsy product, and with the vendor who sold it to me

This is the kind of gift you will give to someone you really, really hate. This thing does NOT shuffle plus it WILL eat up your cards badly. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE... that is unless you wish to annoy the hell out of someone and have fun doing so. If you do go ahead and spend your hard earn mula on this purchase, here are some suggestions on how you can use your brand new Card Shuffler. 

1. Pet Dog's Chew Toy 
2. Door Stop 
3. Play Street Hockey 
4. Stress Release Stomping Toy 
5. Mother-in-law Birthday Gift 
6. Modern Art for Coffee Table 
7. Nerf Ball Target Practice 
8. Condom Dispenser 

Kind of think about it, this is a great toy. Have fun! 

PS. If you are looking for a shuffler that really works maybe you should take a look at: Excalibur Professional 6 Deck Card Shuffler; you might like it.

Two Amazon's statements about this product were absolutely misleading:

1. "Usually ships in 24 hours". It actually took 1 week to ship it.

2. When I finally received the package it turned out that the watch didn't have "leather band". The band was made of artificial materials (nylon and rubber) or something like that.

I will have to return it

i don't really write reviews, but i felt like i needed to say something about this one. maybe its me, but i couldn't get the pump to work. So i bought a new basketball. I bought a regular one, and bought a pump. I wish that infusion thing worked out, because it would have been great to deflate it, put it in my bag, and then pump it up again at the court. But my friend warned me they don't work so good. I'm just stubborn i guess. That's my 2 cents. Take it for what its worth

I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son's airsoft rifle as a Christmas gift. The screws were too short to attach it to his Kitty Kat ( a shortened M-4) airsoft rifle's weaver rail. Yes, I could go out and find screws the proper length, but I though I'd make Airsplat do their job. 

So, after several e-mails with the service department, they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size. Wrong. The diameter of the new screws is so big they won't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight. Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws. Take a pass on Airsplat. The sight seems ok for the price.

I was shopping for a new lunchbox for my son and thought this might be good.  When it arrived it turned out to be much too large for a boy's lunchbox and more for a picnic box for 2-4 people.   I kept it anyway for picnic use and bought a smaller one for his lunch.  The Pranzo is great for a picnic but it is mislabled as a lunchbox

This nightmare was so disappointing! It was hard to assemble, and the instructions were minimal and illegible. It is an overpriced piece of junk. In addition, the net for the hoop was not in the box, and the hoop was put on backwards. My son was so upset. I would think this company would be able to produce a product that would be functional, with proper communication, and some info how to contact them if there was a problem, because there will definitely be a problem!

Our three year old twins received two of these cars for Christmas.  The joystick control broke on one of the cars one hour after they received them on Christmas Day!  My husband ordered a replacement car and then shortly after that, the other cars' joystick control broke!  So, now we are stuck with TWO BROKEN CARS and one that does work, but are wondering when that one will break too!  I need to mention that the kids were NOT particularly rough with the cars; we were right there when the other car broke and did not witness any rough behavior.  The controls are cheap and will break eventually.  The cars are very loud, but on the positive side, the kids do love them and provide fun and entertainment for them.  I would definitely NOT recommend this product

The plug that keeps the air in kept popping out.  We took it back and bought another one.  Same problem.  So we took it back again.  I think we spent more on gas going back and forth than we did on the float.  Buy one of better quality

When I purchased this item I got the impression that the kit (looking at the picture) included everything but the gazebo - which is the frame.
You should be more specific and mention that the kit is just the screen around the frame and the top cover was not part of the kit. I need the top part of the gazebo more than the screen around it. The title of this item should say: "gazebo screen" and not "gazebo screen KIT"...

We bought this tractor from Joe Brands.  It was a big disappointment!  It was very poor quality and did not function at all as was described on the Joe Brands site.  When I contacted Joe Brands and explained all the problems with this tractor they would not refund my money 100%.  They refused to pay the return shipping to send their dysfunctional item back to them.  They told me I had to pay the shipping and send it back to the manufacturer in Wisconsin instead of back to Joe Brands in Colorado.  I am in Las Vegas and it cost me a lot for shipping to Wisconsin instead of Colorado.  When I bought this item they sent it to me with free shipping.  After I shipped it back to them and they received it they disallowed my initial "free shipping" and deducted the original shipping cost from my refund.  I am out over $100 because of Joe Brands.  IF YOU BUY FROM JOE BRANDS YOU MAY BE SORRY!

I bought the armor abs because my gym membership just ended at my college.  So I wanted to get a few small workout machines for home.  The day i got it, one of the rubber bands popped of its holder already.  The machine is designed very poorly, although what can you expect for the price.  I've had to reattach the bands at least 15 times over the past week, and today one of the rubber band holders snapped in half, leaveing that resistance level useless :-( .  Overall though, i have to say, i really love this thing.  If it wasnt for the d*mn bands flyin off all the time, it would be a great peice of equipment.  If you use it carefully and correctly, you may be able to avoid these problems though.  I give it a two because i love the machine, but i hate its bad habits...

Does not work like advertised.  Ball falls way to low and right next to the pole way before you can hit it again.  It may also damage a wood or aluminum bat.  Last time I buy anything before reading the reviews on amazon.

I bought this for my 10 year old son's birthday.  He was very excited about it and having Derek Jeter endorse it was an added treat for him.  We spent half an hour setting it up and trying to figure out how to use it.  We eventually concluded that it was a BIG disappointment.  The ball comes around real slow and drops to the bottom of the pole.  I was worried he was going to hit the pole instead of the ball.  I can imagine how this might work for a power hitter like Jeter, but imagine a 10 year old!  Save your money, time, and child's feelings

This is the first product I've bought through Amazon that I wish I could give a negative star rating.  After involving three adults and spending about 3 hours troubleshooting, I've concluded this product **** DOES NOT *** work.  Customer service cites this is a "product upgrade".  A video shows cable wrapping around pole and unleashing with sufficient velocity to hit.  What we received was a cable of similar rigidity to what you would lock your bike up with or tow a small vehicle.  It would barely even unwrap.  Imagine Derek Jeter in the photo trying to hit the ball three inches from the pole at 1.5 miles per hour and you can begin to understand this product upgrade.

This looks better on TV than it actually works.  The cable that the ball is connected to is very rigid and you have to really hit the ball hard to get it to wrap around.  When it unwinds it does so VERY slow and loses it's momentum and sinks to the pole before you even get a chance to hit it.  Plus they advise you not to use an aluminum or wood bat to hit it with?  What are you supposed to hit it with then?  These things you don't find out until you get it out of the box and set it up.  Don't waste money on this item

This bike should not have the name Mountain in it, you can not take this bike off ride.  It might be good for paved roads but you will hurt yourself if you try to use this bike even on the most basic of trails.

Do not buy this bike

I had purchased a rifle from Airslat and it broke after 3 minutes of use.  The quality was not good, but, the customer service of this company is the worst i have ever dealt with.  It has been 2 weeks and no replacement has been shipped.  i have had every excuse imaginable, first they wanted me to pay for shipping, then they wanted me to pay full price for another gun, then they said they did not have that model any longer and I would have to pay for the higher priced model.  i still have not been refunded or had the item replaced.  i have spent hours trying to get this taken care of with no progress.  the worst customer service of all time!

I used this product for surface level snorkeling and was extremely disappointed: 1) it filled up with water after only 15 minutes in the water and 2) the plastic holder came off of the clasp during snorkeling (luckly, I noticed it floating near me when I stoped to clear my mask).  Referring to this product as 'waterproof' is criminal as everything I placed in the holder was saturated with water; even after dumping it out and resealing throughout the day it continued to fill up with water.  In addition, this product is overpriced as a snorkeling mate found a truly waterproof holder at a dollar store that kept his contents perfectly dry throughout the day.

Purchased the 418 Elliptical 5 months ago now.  Reviews after a week or two may not tell the whole story.  After 3 weeks the clicks, squeaks and clunks wouldn't go away by just tighting bolts so I called for service.  It took 4 weeks to get a tech. to look at it, he had to order parts which took another 4 weeks.  Replaced one of the main flywheels inside and the track rollers under the pedals.  It's not as noisy now but still makes a clicking noise on every rotation and intermittent squeaks and clunks.  Thought by spending a little more on this machine than the cheaper competition these problems would have been avoided, not so.

The heat rate monitor is not accurate but the rest of the electronic features have been working fine, unlike many other reviewer's comments

This tent is alright. Its not very sturdy and they sent me the wrong parts. I bought it in the spring and this fall, with a little bit of wind its in pieces and in the garbage. I don't really think its worth the money. It is very spacious, just wish it was better made.

I was surprised when I received what appeared to be a sales brochure. I searched carefully through the shipping materials to see if I had missed the book entirely, but in fact the small, clumsily put together manual was in fact the $3.75 book that I bought online. It has some new exercises in it, but most of what we needed to know came with the therabands in the little manual that ships with them.

i dont have this ramp but my neighbor does. i have a homemade quaterpipe that is 4 feet in height and is about the same price in materials. the lauch ramp is really small and after awhile it gets pretty boring. im a skateboarder and usually go 2 da sk8prk which i find more fun then playing on a small lauch ramp. i dont think this ramp is worth the price at all. u can get ramp plans on websites for free and u can build a much better ramp for a cheeper price

This ramp set is really fun to skate on, but keep in mind that it takes a lot of damage. First it will begin to slide when you skate on it due to lost rubber bottoms. Screwing screws into the edges of the ramp can somewhat solve this problem. The worst thing that happens is when the front of the ramp begins to curl upward, making it so you have to constantly pull it back down. I forgot to do this one time and my skateboard wheels locked up and I went flying. But don't let this turn you away. It is a good fly box nonetheless, but just keep in mind that a homemade wooden one would last you a lifetime, not a year.

Have received and reviewed this item. I cranked it for 2 minutes. The radio played no longer than 2-3 minutes then died. I tried to crank it longer - same results. It is useless. It's large and bulky (though very sleek and nice). The cranking handle looks fragile and I suspect with all the cranking this toy needs, it will break sooner than later. Bottom line: Don't buy it. I own another similar product which has a simple look however the radio plays for at least one hour on a 1 - 2 minutes crank

This radio has a very good rich sound for such a small speaker.  The 1 bulb LED flashlight is brighter than I thought it would be.  The rubberized case is solid and durable.  Two minutes of cranking has consistently provided 45 minutes of play time at average volume.  There are 3 big drawbacks.  1. The tuning knob is very small and next to impossible to read.  2. The crank handle is the smallest I've seen and feels like it will break easily.  3. The worst feature is the on/off switch for the flashlight. It is a "push" round button mounted on the side that keeps turning itself on when you hold the radio or pick it up.  They should have used a "slide" switch and put it in a different area

I just bought this product and it is sturdy and cheap. But there is not instruction manual on how to use the buttons or explain that stupid twist plate. What is it for, I can twist without it. Anyway, 10 mins after using the machine I got a severe knee injury. I didnt have an injury before using it but I got one now. I am going to have to get rid of it.

it was the best price around and when it finally showed up at my door i couldn't wait to put it together until it was harder than it looked. you should use more than one person to put it together maybe it was my fault but the net was not fast nor easy to set up, just like the box says it was a challenge. Extremely! I would not recommend this product for someone who has no time nor patience for an hour long set up process. I do recommend anything that folds up quick and pops up into position. But the extreme deal would be an actual 10x10x10 cage you could get online for less than 500$. You might have to spend the money but to not have to deal with the headaches over and over again putting this together is well worth it. find your self an area out side and build your real cage and enjoy it all year long. The nets are not worth the time nor the money, balls still fly up out of the net, you have to be really close and the fabric is just like a tent. with as much force as im hitting the balls with it wont be long till the material is damaged. Dont waste your money even if you do get it for 60 bucks. The wind will always win, once it catches sail it tumbles like sage grass. Get Bigger Better Deals with the real Cage

I received the net missing a pole which you obviously need to erect the net properly.  But I was particularly disappointed in the net and its ability to stop a golf ball.  It no more stopped a driven golf ball than drapped toilet paper! Unless you hit the nylon target, you have lost a ball!  I may as well hang the nylon target alone from a tree and the results will be the same if I miss the target

I got this net and set it up in February and been using it fairly regularly. I was hitting some balls tonight and noticed some tears in the netting much to my disappointment! 

Shouldn't a $100.00 golf net last longer than 3-4 months?

Completely unacceptable

I have seen some really dumb things in my 46 years but this flashlight is near the top of the list.  A flashlight whose power reserve lasts only 30 minutes after 15 hours spent charging.  Sad thing is after not much more than 3 minutes the flashlight is down to half brightness.  8 minutes after turning it on the light it gives out is useless such that you would do better turning this flashlight off allowing your eyes to adjust to the darkness at least you will see more than what you did with this lame light.  I have heard some wild stories but the reality of this flashlight has me thinking the people who made this monstrosity are quite totally and completely insane living in fantasy land.

This flashlight is what you buy when you just want a prop to take up space and look good because as a tool for illuminating space it is totally, utterly and profoundly useless.  Your Good Money invested in this flashlight instantly becomes money wasted with no hope of any meaningful return whatsoever.  Don't say we did not warn you!  This flashlight should have a sign on it that says I am awesomely pathetic buy at your own risk!

Small print on box: Charging the spotlight takes approximately 15 hours using the AC charger adapter, and approximately 12-20 hours using the 12V car adapter. The spotlight/lantern cannot be used while charging. A full charge will provide for approximately 30 minutes of power.

30 MINUTES after charging for 15 HOURS? What the heck is the point of this flashlight

Despite charging the flashlight for the required 15 hours, the light failed to shine for more than 5 minutes. Also during those lackluster minutes of operation, the emanating light seemed to be nowhere near the advertised 1 million candle power

Our three year old twins received two of these cars for Christmas.  The joystick control broke on one of the cars one hour after they received them on Christmas Day!  My husband ordered a replacement car and then shortly after that, the other cars' joystick control broke!  So, now we are stuck with TWO BROKEN CARS and one that does work, but are wondering when that one will break too!  I need to mention that the kids were NOT particularly rough with the cars; we were right there when the other car broke and did not witness any rough behavior.  The controls are cheap and will break eventually.  The cars are very loud, but on the positive side, the kids do love them and provide fun and entertainment for them.  I would definitely NOT recommend this product

We opened 2 Razor Bumper Buggy's for Hanukkah that we got as gifts from a family member.  Both of them were missing the charger for the battery (and other hardware), so our kids couldn't even play with them.  They were very disappointed.  What is worse, Razor's customer service is TERRIBLE!  They would not send us the missing chargers without a receipt.  Of course, since they were gifts, we didn't have the reciept.  Razor refused to help us until we could get proof of purchase from a credit card statement, which won't be for a couple of weeks.  Then of course it will take a couple more weeks to actually get the chargers.  All this hassle, all the hours on the phone, when they could have just sent us the missing chargers, like any decent company would for such a high price item!  

Our poor kids, just looking at their motionless bumper cars.

Of course, we can't actually review whether the prodcut is any good or not until sometime in Februrary when we actually get to use it.  

Happy Hanukkah to you too, Razor

I ordered this bike for my granddaughters 4th birthday.  The first shipment arrived on schedule, but the box was total destroyed and without opening you could see that the bike was scratched and dented.  Delivery was refused and another bike was sent.  The 2nd bike arrived, with the box being in less than perfect condition, but delivery was accepted.  When my son started assembling the bike, he found that several of the parts had been assembled at the factory incorrectly and he could not assemble the bike.  The bike was returned for a credit and we went and purchased a similar bike locally.  We still have not received a credit for the return of the bike.  I am very disappointed and will not purchase from this vendor again

I bought this watch for work to time a 2 min procedure.  I found the 30 sec sweep hard to get used to.  I'm used to a 60 sec sweep. And the minute hand was difficult to read.  I really had to check to see if I was at 1.5 min or 2.5 min.

I only had this for about 2 days before the resistance band broke in 2 places.

I found the performance of these Michelin tires to be adequate.  There doesn't seem to be too much in the way of rolling resistance and they grip the road well.  The road seems to have eaten these tires up...I have less than 1,000 miles on it and the tires are full of holes--that may say something about the quality of roads out here in Hawaii.  I'm getting a flat every time I ride.  My next tire will be something a little sturdier

I did get a nice little buzz the first two days I took this product, and it does give you a boost when you take it right before you work out.  You can push yourself a bit further at the gym.  The gassiness and stomach discomfort are what cause me to not recommend this product.  It wasn't so good or effective that the side effects were worth it.  I had no lasting weight loss when taking it, just lost 3 lbs the first 2 days taking it which climbed back on a day later.  I'd skip it

There is nothing wrong with the knife itself but there is a major design flaw. The ring to attach the knife to say a set of keys is on the wrong side; so the open knife is not away from the set of keys. This is the first swiss army knife I have ever come across with this flaw. So alway make sure the ring is opposite the swiss army logo!!

I am writing this as a review of Hippo clubs in general.  I purchased a simmilar set from Amazon a year ago because it was a $300 set or irons reduced to $100.  I was interested in the graphite shafts (all I have ever used is steel) and wanted a cheap set to travel with (I have had 2 different sets of clubs lost during travel).  

The first thing that I noticed with these clubs was my miss-hits rose dramatically.  The clubs looked nice enough, but their performance was less than par.  When I talked with my club pro, he said that the problem with buying graphite shafted clubs that are inexpensive like these Hippos is that the shafts are cheap not consistant.  Your average pro plays with graphite shafts that cost up to $80 each.  He also indicated to me that high handicappers tend to buy cheap clubs (which was a humbling fact that I had to swallow), and that high handicappers tend to play better with steel shafts.  

All of this being said, I chalked up my $100 mistake and began looking locally at all of the golf shops for high-quality pre-owned clubs.  After 2 weeks, I found a hardly used set of '04 Big Berthas for $359.  I talked the salesman down to $299 and walked out with the best set of clubs that I have ever hit.  I guess my point is that if you are looking at these clubs, you are either a new or relatively unskilled player-- like me.  If this is the case, take some time and search out high-quality pre-owned or used equipment that will make your learning curve my shorter.  Let the golfers that get new clubs every two years spend $600-$1000 for new sets.  Take advantage of their trade-ins.  That's my opinion anyway

I had to repurchase this product, because my first one broke, the hinge that they use to attach the battery door to is pathetic, seriously a design flaw. However, with some Epoxy glue and a different type of hinge you can modify the origional product to be something better. In this case you really get what you pay for... Its dirt cheap plastic and it breaks easily. I wouldnt recommend getting this unless you need something dirt cheap and only plan on using it a few times.

The only satisfaction I have gotten out of this product is this opportunity to vent.  If the price seems too cheap, it is.  Where to begin?  Instructions, pretty bad.  Hardware, missing, inconsistent, inadequate.  Design, deeply flawed.  Mounting, not on my standard mountain bike.  Manufacture, cheap, cheap, cheap.

What result culminated my frustrating evening retrofitting it just to see if it would work?  I'll spare you the suspense, it didn't.  Not a glimmer.

I bought a pair of these as a workout set for heavy bag use, and have been mostly disappointed with them for that purpose.

Pros: Easy on and off, even putting them on by yourself. Wrist straps are simple and hold well. Breathe surprisingly well for the design.

Cons: Even with hand wraps on, I found my right glove to fit too poorly to absorb punches well; the design makes it hard to form a proper fist without trying to grip the glove into a proper position to do so. The left I have no problem with for some reason, maybe just have a bad pair? The padding makes blows glance off of the bag to a degree that it made me feel like I was risking injury when using them for actual impact punches. Grips make my hands feel too open when punching, can't grip a tight fist... my hands would be bruised or very sore after even a modest workout with them

This product falls into the category of "not worth the cost of shipping" for me.  The bag is a basic black nylon bag that is adequate for holding a large yoga mat.  The bag was shipped in an envelope via USPS first class mail for $1.35.  SAMFE was the retailer that Amazon used for this transaction, so Free Super Saver Shipping was not available.  SAMFE charged $7.50 for shipping.  I generally stay away from retailers who charge shipping in order to boost their profits, hence the low-star rating for an otherwise adequate product

we bought 2 of these "things" they both literally fell apart within 2 weeks of receipt

the stitching, in various parts of the bag came undone, we ended up throwing them away.

i've been purchasing things on line since 1995, and this product was by far the WORST thing we've ever bought!!!

run away, run away

I bought my free-standing heavy bag at a local store and I was very excited to try my new product.  When I got home I was in for a shock.  There were at least sixteen screws, locks, and washers in a little bag.  In addition to that, there was about twelve additional pieces that needed to be put together.  All in all, it took me about two hours to put this puzzle together and eventhough it weighs about 275 pounds once it's filled with water, it does not take much to move it around when striking during a workout.  I need to keep readjusting the base back to its original position every three to four punches I throw on it.  For the amount of money that I paid, this bag should have been put together for me.  I will keep the bag and put it outside.  If somebody steals it, they will be doing me a favor.  Next time I will go with what I know and buy a wavemaster from Century, now that is an awesome product

I didn't read in the instructions that I was also buying a dancing partner.  This thing just *will not* stay still.  I tried putting it on carpet and on wood floors, but the water weight just isn't enough to keep it still.  Power punching causes the base to tip and then slam back to the floor making a terrible racket.  If I lived in an apartment, my neighbors would hate me.  

The water ends up around 200lbs (when full) and just doesn't do the trick.  I have been thinking of using sand which tops out around 320lbs, but not sure how easy it will be to get back out since the only opening is a small opening on top meant for water.

As for springiness, you can definitely wail on this thing and it can take it (by moving across the floor), but in my opinion it's TOO springy.  There is no comparison to hitting a hanging bag.  It definitely needs a tension adjustment.

I'd say this bag is probably better for practicing control.  I wouldn't suggest this for an apartment if you plan on power-hitting

     I won't mention about the quality of this product. But this standbag doesn't have enough weight to stand my punch. I filled this with water to the full, and when I throw a hook the front part goes up in the air and comes down. Am I supposed to fill this up with lead?
     
     I'm not bragging. I am below average young males' heights and weights, I don't work out, never had a boxing training, just sometimes visit the gym with sandbags and throw punches when I'm depressed.
     
     I can't believe those guys who wrote the reviews are so weak to be satisfied with this stuff. I'm returning this and get a real heavy bag, even if it will cost a lot

I've had this product about a month, purchased from a sporting goods store - at first all was well.  Unfortunately the bag became shakier and shakier as time progressed.  I had to reset the screws (as other reviews for this product have mentioned) - but one screw WOULD not come out.  It was stripped.  A week later, same problem.  I tend to hit the bag about 2 hours a day 3 times a week and 1 hour a day the rest of the week.  Apparently hitting it causes the screws to warp the holes of metal centerpiece which connects the stand & bag to the base.  This causes either:

a) screws to strip
b) the holes to enlarge and warp, meaning screws no longer catch.

Apparently whoever designed this product forgot that a punching bag is made to be struck and hit.

Today finally the bag got KO'ed because now only two holes in the metal centerpiece out of eight will actually securely catch the screws.  I'm a 6'1 220 lb. guy and I'm only using about half of my full force into my punches (again, I hit it just about every day) - so in other words this bag is definitely not intended for heavy-duty use.  I'll call Everlast Monday and keep my fingers crossed that the replacement part is made sturdier than the original

I bought this stroller because it looked nice and sturdy.  I liked the stroller with air-filled wheels and other features such as brake and wheel-locks.  However, this stroller is so cumbersome if you have a compact car.  Even with my Acura, I still have to take apart the front wheel to fit the stroller in the trunk.  Imagine you have your kid and have to assembly your stroller in a before your walk.  It's inconvenient and takes up lots of space in your car's trunk.  I was mislead by Amazon description of the stroller that it would fit in trunk of any car.  Yes it would fit but you have to take apart the front wheel to make it fit in.

I bought a mesh chair that looked very similar to this and loved it, so I thought I might like the Alps chair too.  I was wrong. It's very light weight, but it's a lot longer than my other chairs, which made it more difficult to carry and transport.  The arms are attached to the seat with cheap plastic fittings, one of which broke the first time I used the chair.  The next day, three of the support bars broke completely apart at the rivet points, throwing me to the ground and rendering the chair completely useless.  Save your money on this one

Got my Bowflex weeks ago and having trouble, lots of trouble putting it together. It's not the product's fault other than the fact that putting together is a real 'mutha. Seems the parts could've been marked better. Identification is pretty much visual. Instead, you have a "picture map" to compare what part is needed. I was doing fine until I inserted the wrong bolt, stripped the bolt trying to get it out, got the WD40 on it, finally had to use a crescent wrench. So, my confidence is blown and then I continued on to assemble the seat backwards. The assemblage directions could be better, believe me. I used the 800# once, but I finally found that no matter what was suggested, the picture was misleading and there's no way that could've been explained. Onward through the fog!

When I purchased a pair of these gloves a couple of years ago, I had high hopes.  My hands become cold easily, and I was looking forward to wearing gloves that would actively help in warming them.


I will admit that these gloves are respectable as normal, unheated gloves.  They are fairly well insulated and provide a moderate degree of dexterity.

However, the heating element is ineffective.  Inserting batteries into the gloves provided little (if any) increase in warmth.  My fingers remained cold.

In addition, I have recently discovered that the thin wire connecting the heating element to the battery in one of the gloves has become disconnected.  These gloves have not been subjected to any harsh abuse, so it is disappointing to find that the wire had been disconnected so easily.

If you are looking for a pair of heated gloves that will actually make a difference and keep your hands (including your fingers)warm, look elsewhere

I purchased this item based on the picture.  I didn't want a cheap looking air-hockey table because I planned to keep it for a long time.  The price seemed good for the looks of the table even though the shipping was $150.  Arranging delivery with the carrier was a bit awkward, but not too bad, but the box itself was clearly abused and showed a general lack of care in handling.  I don't know if the abuse was from the carrier delivering it to me or prior carrier, but it did have me worried about the condition of the contents.  I couldn't see any parts through the holes and tears in the box, so I hoped for the best.  When I opened the box, there was no obvious shipping damage, however there was one spot on the surface that could have been caused by improper packaging.

The assembly instructions were a poor quality photocopy that cut the top line off most pages.  There was a separate sheet of paper instructing me to line up letter tags during assembly, however, the tags were not properly placed and assembly per the diagram on the sheet would have been impossible.  Assuming all parts were symmetrical worked just as well.

I was also disappointed with the quality of the assembly of the main components.  Alignment was poor, making final assembly difficult, and there was excessive adhesive all over the place, even on the playing surface.  I was able to remove most of the adhesive from the playing surface except for one spot that may have been damage from shipping.  The table comes with a 90 warranty on materials and workmanship, but doesn't include shipping.  As the table surface is the largest component, I'm imagining it would cost most of the $150 shipping fee to have it replaced.  At this point, I'm not willing to sink any more money into this table.

After the table was set up, I was hoping it would at least play well.  I was disappointed there too.  There are some plastic guards on the goals that make scoring very difficult.  I've never seen anything like them on other tables.  By the time you get the puck moving fast enough to evade your opponents blocking of the small opening your shooting for, it fly's off the table.  In fact you spend more time retrieving the puck than you do playing.  Maybe this has something to do with the extra adhesive down the sides of the playing surface, but it still ruins the game.  There were a lot of excited kids when the table arrived.  They all played about one game and now the table sits unused.

All in all, this has been my most disappointing online purchase.  I guess there are some things you see first hand before you buy

I love the lenses but these goggles are painful to wear.  I tried various adjustments but they are still too uncomfortable.  I sent an email to Speedo  to let them know.

I ordered and received this item through The Golf Warehouse. It arrived and I immediately saw a defect,in that the magnetic balls would not release correectly, even with major force. I contacted the Golf Wrehouse and they told me to return the item to them. I requested a refund but they refused this saying the item showed signs of use and returned it to me. Since then I have tried to contact David Leadbetter's organization but without any success. I am desperately unhappy about this purchase and, in particular, the after sales service.

I bought this toy for my 9 month old son for Christmas. He loved it and it is a wonderful toy. However, in mid January it started to sound as if the batteries were dying and then it just quit. I replaced the batteries but to my disappointment it still wouldn't work. I tried different batteries again just to be sure and still nothing. I had a very hard time finding out how to contact imaginarium.com and finally just emailed amazon. They responded quickly and it appears that I will be able to return the toy and my son liked it enough that I may take my chances and buy it again. There are mixed reviews some saying that it is durable and works great and a few like mine

Our kids loved this - so much so that when one dropped it and broke the plastic strip by the on/off button (making the toy unusable), I bought another one.  Wouldn't you know the same thing happened a few weeks later?  This toy is supposed to be made for small children who have been known to drop things on occasion...the manufacturer needs to correct this problem

My husband inflated it and was extra careful not to overinflate it but it still popped before the kids even had a chnace to try it. they were so disappointed:( this has now happened twice!!!!! fyi, the first one we inflated and it deflated within days (slow leak). what a waste! it is so heavy that it would cost $20 to mail it back for a replacement. don't bother.

For the price, I shouldn't complain, but what the heck?  What ever happened to quality control?  It came double shrink wrapped.  There was a plastic handle guard that didn't fit the sword, so I had to just throw it away.  Very little pride in the product.  The wood was roughly sanded before it was painted.  Well, it's just a stick afterall.  I'm just glad I did not purchase a more expensive item from this vendor, DreamObjects.  Read their feedback responses -- sounds a lot like aggressive Ebay sellers who get their jollies replying to negative or lukewarm feedback.  Sorry -- waste of my time and a few dollars.  I gave them a 4 out of 5 feedback simply because you can't tell quality from a single digital photo

I purchased this rack a few months ago and it is very neat. Problem is that it does tend to move when you put the MTX bag on. The movement becomes more of a problem as the weight of the bag increases. Another problem was getting enough clearance between the rack and the tire if you are short like me and don't have the seat raised up really far. If you play around enough you can get it to work, but if you decide to put on the Topek rear fender (which I did)you may have to adjust your seat a little higher than might be comfortable. I just got accustomed to having the seat a little higher. Bottom line is that Topek has made a very neat system that just needs a few more refinements (and some better instructions) to make it perfect.

These seats, while they are as nice as they look, do not fit into a "seat" at the stadium, rendering them USELESS!  They take up 1.25 seats per, and if you are at a sold out game you will not be able to use them, especially if you have 2.  They need to make them a few inches smaller

Due to lack of space, and in need of activity I have decided to buy a mini stepped to increase my daily phsycial activity. This one I bought from a retail market and the reason for me to choose particularly this one was the price (of course), the flexbands with counter.

Very limited documentation, it doesn't tell you actually how you can adjust the difficulty levet, I figured out a better way after two weeks by experimenting the device. 

And then it sarted to make craking noises. So I used some olive oil on the joints that passed. Then The suspensions got air inside and at the very begging of the step it started to make a crack noise which I couldn't evade at all.

While experirmenting the device, the electronic part got loose, it was attached with a soo thin cable, one touch and the cable was torn off. OK I said that was my fault, I shouldn't have touched it.

But...

Today, the `steel` cable that holds the pedals got apart. That is so suprizing, I am only 80 kg, and using it usually every two days for 30 minutes... Very bad construction.

Ok... Why I gave 2 stars? The flexicables worked really well. 
That deserves a point.

I bought this basket because it was the lowest price and cool looking.
But after I say 2-3 months the basket broke in one spot near the handlebars, at a critical point. I did carry a heavy backpack in the basket. But still I think the basket is a piece of junk.

Plus the basket requires you use the hardware to connect to the fork, which limits your height of your handlebars. The basket seemed like it was badly put together and just not durable. 

I can't recommend this basket.
Buy a basket from your local sports authority or something.

thanks

The snap on the Leapers "Elite" Drop Leg Holster (the term Elite must be used loosely) would never stay attached. It would always either unsnap or come loose at the back. Eventually it fell off in the field and I lost it. The straps would never stay securely in the place I positioned them. 

The Leapers Deluxe Drop Leg Holster is much more effective. Even w/ one strap it stays secure becuase of the wide band of material in place. The method for latching the gun in the holster is much more effective as well. Spend a few more dollars for the Deluxe holster rather than trying to work with the Elite

This was the 2nd DVD with problems that I bought from this vendor.  The first DVD had 2 sections where the DVD would pause but would continue playing, and I was willing to live with it.  Bootcamp/Muscle Endurance, on the other hand, would not play the Muscle Endurance workout at all!  I contacted the vendor and they said it was a problem with my DVD player and they would only allow me to exchange with any of their 'OPEN' dvds only to 'better suite my needs'.  I own 20+ workout DVDs and none of them gave me any problems like this one did.  The DVD is also fairly pricey and so I'm afraid to buy any more of these dvds from them.  I was able to play the Bootcamp workout until towards the end (before the cool down section) where it would not continue playing.  I like Cathe's workout very much.  The part of Bootcamp that I was able to play was excellent! But I am very disappointed with this vendor

Well I purchased this bike because I previously had a Schwinn recumbent bike that I was pretty happy with but had to sell it because I moved. I'm very disappointed with this upright bike though. I think the seat is very very uncomfortable, so uncomfortable that I don't want to use the product. The seat design in itself it horrible. The way it bolts on is a little strange, and it appears all the Schwinn upright models are like this. Even though I have the seat bolted down all the way, it still wiggles. As others have mentioned, my box came trashed all ripped and with holes in it. In fact, the UPS driver actually told me that I might want to refuse the product, but I took it anyways. I think I'm going to attempt to return this if possible. Although the entire process is a huge hassle since I work everyday, the box is trashed, and how heavy the product is. I also had to help the UPS driver carry it up to my 3rd floor apt. I don't recommend any Schwinn upright bikes, although I likes their recumbent series. I hope Amazon will help me come up with a solution to return this

I purchased a new 26" Men's Huffy Cranbrook Cruiser Bike. After assembly, to my surprise the rear wheel would not inflate because of a bad inner tube.

So what do you do, disassemble and return? No, call Huffy and they take you through nine hoops.  Finally they sent me the right part which took ten days, and I took the bike to a local fix it shop which charged me $15 labor to fix the rear wheel.

No savings!

P.S. The bike is a piece of junk made in China.  The instruction manual is nearly useless

This step sucks.  If you are used to doing step classes at the gym, you will find it difficult to switch to this smaller step.  I didn't know it was a smaller step or I wouldn't have bought it.  It is hard to adjust to the shorter step, especially when doing a turn step or V step.  It ends up being VERY close to a basic step.  I was so nervous about stepping too close to the end and flipping the whole step up, that I was cheating myself out of a full workout.  DO NOT buy this, if you're used to the step at the club.  I feel like it's more dangerous on this, and ended up doing a lot of the steps on the floor.  If you already know that you like to step, buck up and buy the club size step, even though it is twice the price of this one.  Otherwise, don't buy anything

The way these bags are constructed - or supposed to be - is that they are stuffed with fibers, and filled with sand, for weight, AT THE BOTTOM -  the part you DON'T punch.

I was wondering why it felt like I was punching a brick wall on the left side: that's where they stuck the bags of sand. Just what a fighter needs before a fight (or anyone needs at any time of their life) - to be punching compacted bags of crushed rock.

This is a clear defect: I am considering returning it. Not sure if they're all like this, but I assume mine is not unique. Can't find where it says it was manufactured, but in this day and age, and based on the "craftsmanship", it's reasonable to assume China. Hey - at least the cardboard box it came in was made in Missouri!

Mine also suffered a little damage during shipping: the box had a small hole in it and the bag got scuffed. It usually takes years of pounding before this type of damage occurs on it's own.

Hey, it's hit or miss when you order online, particularly with oversized items, as far as shipping an "handling" are concerned. The shipping box was damaged and oil stained, the product poorly constructed. So, I'd call this a "miss"

I bought both the Ark III and the Super Ark.  The Super Ark is a slight improvement over the Ark III but I would never recommend people buy either one.  There are far better entry-level kits, for just a few dollars more, available from other sources.  

The Ark III contains 24 oz. of water, a food bar, and a small, inexpensive emergency blanket in a Kleenex-sized cardboard box.  I'll use the products in the two kits to supplement the emergency kits I subsequently purchased.

I'm surprised - and disappointed - Amazon carries these products

Tent leaks in multiple places; including door seam, back panel, and through seams on Rainfly!  This is NOT normal condensation (I promise), but leaks that resulted in two bath towels and one sleeping bag getting soaked.  The tent was set up according to instructions with Rainfly secure and failed to keep its occupants (2 adults and a three year old) dry during a rain. Made for a miserable experience.

This gun is a piece of $#!&
My bro got it some time ago. He was so excited. It made me glad to see that he was so gung ho about his new airsoft. 

He loaded it, aimed at a 1-foot target not more than 20 feet away, sprayed as accurately as possible, and guess what happened...?

Yup, out of the 20 in the clip, about 5 or 6 hit. Not on the bull's eye, I can tell you that. The 20 shots went wayyyyyyy too fast for comfort, and the accuracy sucked like mad, but my brother's hopes were not dashed yet. (-_-)

He filled up the 110-shot mag, winded it up, aimed, and the same thing resulted, only this time, the spray lasted longer than 3.5 seconds.

OUT OF MAYBE 50 SHOTS FIRED, ABOUT 12 HIT. I checked the gun all around, but it was not defective at all, except for the part that this gun was made very cheaply.

My brother tried it on semi-auto, which is usually more accurate. Not for this gun, though. In fact, the semi-auto was even less accurate than the automatic feature!!! OUT OF 10 SHOTS, ONE OR TWO HIT! i COULDN'T TELL BECAUSE THIS GUN'S 140 FPS MADE BARELY A SOUND WHEN IT HIT THE TARGET! (We were shooting in the dark.)

Let's not even talk about the "red dot scope," or the "silencer."

I only gave it a two because (1) That is the next lowest you can give, and (2) This gun's looks is okay. Please buy a different gun off ebay or something!!! You can get an m16 with a grenade launcher with 300 fps and 300 mag cap for less than 20 bucks (if you bid correctly)!

By the time my brother had finished playing, his dopamine levels were probably under normal. In simple terms, he was disappointed

       I recieved this gun about a week ago and couldn't wait for it to arrive. It managed to arrive one day early because I live close to it's store in California. When I recieved it I couldn't figure out why I could not mount the scope. It was broken. Next I tried to read the instructions which are total crap because they are awfully written. I started to shoot it and every time I wanted to use the larger clip I had to jam it into the socket every time it stopped shooting, which was quite often.

               Next I had my sister shoot me with it from about 10 feet away and didn't even feel it when the BB's hit in a T-shirt. Plus, aftera while of shooting the semi-automatic started to fail and it would only shoot automatic. Lastly, in it's first CQB the strap fell completely off. 

Here are the main good's and bad's of this gun.
Good:
-relatively cheap
-lays down a lot of BB's in a short amount of time.
-collapsable stock is nice.
-relativly accuracte at close range

Bad:
-Clips either tiny or worthless because it won't stay in the gun.
-extremely weak
-accesories may come broken.
-insructions awful.
-low battery life.
-fire settings jam/don't work 

P.S I'm not really Jacqueline K. Schmidt

Good points of the EL-300: Powerful sharp beam; LONG run per battery change; easy on-off quick-mount clamp for anti-theft; and, it's a superb FLASHLIGHT. I like to use it for undersink and underhood repairs, so I often borrow it from my bike. This light is intense enough to force a person to avert eyes, if the beam hits direct from even, say 40 away. Cateye does caution us not to play the beam on people's eyes. In my estimate, it is mostly a terrific flashlight, and not a great bike-mounted headlight, at least as a stand-alone.

Trouble is, that sharp-focused narrow beam makes you choose between two conflicting and shifting essentials: lighting your path (you actually CAN with this focused power); or alerting others to your presence. That would mean focusing it more toward oncoming traffic, or a tad right or left, toward peripheral traffic, depending where you are, and how the road tracks, and where cars are coming from. It's a real attention-getter to oncoming drivers, which is great, if conditions are all just right: IF you focus the lamp near level, and if the drivers are considerate enough to all approach from in front of your beam. 

However, traffic off to the side is another deal, since the headlight's peripheral light suffers by contrast. I nearly took a short trip to a long rest, as a result. Late on a quiet night, one flaky guy entering a major, broad secondary road I was traveling was coming fast up to his stop-sign, on a side street to my right, ahead of where I had just rounded a curve. He had a view accross broad lawns, on up the dark road behind me.

After slowing just a bit, he accelerated and ran his stop sign. I was right near his position on his side-street, "committed," pedaling about 15 - 17 MPH, about to cross his bow. He started his right turn, gunning it, merging with unseen ME. He was totally UNAWARE OF ME, and was clearly of this mindset: 
         "No double-CAR-headlights,
          no CAR noise,
          so no CAR, 
          so nuttin' coming, 
          so, good-to-go, so -- GUN IT!" ... all in the space of a couple seconds.

Moving fast, with the right-of-way, I had the EL-300 blazing away bright. Only, it was focused straight ahead of me, and a tad downward toward the road surface yards in front. I was dependent on the EL-300, to send ahead to the likes of him, unavoidable announcing LIGHT. It's what I paid for (about $45.00 delivered). I also wore a white helmet, had reflective stripes on my panniers and rack trunk, and the churning reflectors on wheels and pedals. But I know darn well all the reflectors in the world have no merit, when not bathed by headlights, and if not also bouncing back at a narrow angle to the driver's eyes. That's why I own a headlight. It's why now-enlightened NJ demands a bike headlight.

Of course, neither does a DRIVER have any merit, when s/he rewrites the stopsign law to read "No need to stop as long as I don't SEE ANYONE COMING." He nearly killed me, coming fast at me, broadside. He had regained nearly 15 or more mph as he started his right turn, still accelerating, when he spotted me and panic-braked. We were at one point about 2 feet apart, thanks to his hard braking, and my veering left on the (luckily deserted) dark main road. 

I was, for a fraction of a second, looking DOWN at his headlights and bumper almost below me. Could have reached over and touched his hood ornament. Incredible experience. It was my closest call ever, and scared the hell out of me. It must've scared the hell out of him, too. He registered his shock-and-awe with a reproaching after-fact horn blast, as he scrambled around and passed me, racing off before I could read his plate.

I guess it must've ticked him off, my scaring HIM with that close call. One little vehicular manslaughter can change your address awhile. Equally maddening for him, after he passed the intruding cyclist with the red blinkie taillight, and the white helmet, and all the reflectors (THOSE alerted him, once I was his front-and-center target), he would had to then see that blazing headlight's pencil-beam in his rear-view mirror. Damn, nuttin' he could blame on this creep on the bike. :-[

The EL-300 simply failed me that time, as I see it, by focusing most of its light in a narrow, long-projecting beam. It was focused left of where he was looking, when I was very close to the side street he was traveling, ignoring his stop-sign. There should, from so much light energy, be some part diverted wider, closer to the bike, even if lower intensity.

In my judgement there are two related design flaws with this lamp:
1. The narrow focused beam, making you "live(??) with" the single direction in which you aim the beam. Its relatively dim peripheral light gets lost in any ambient light. 
2. That is in turn aggravated by its wandering from the aiming you settle on, both vertically and horizontally. The vertical part is the worse; the mounting clamp sets too far back from the headlight's balance-point, so it's a seesaw that's forward-heavy. Lift your bike front, tap it down lightly, and you've likely refocused the lamp lower, as you would not if the mounting were at the balance-point. Aim it temporarily right (and tight), and you are seemingly good to go ... but only as far as the first noticeable bump. It then drops a few degrees, and you keep correcting it vertically, to light EITHER your intended path, or the oncoming drivers' windshields. Your need is like being at the Oscars: you want to both see, and BE SEEN, only in this case to save your life.

I am chasing after another LED lamp now, which I understand to have a wider (along with brighter) beam. I have respect for Cateye in general. Their current website page of battery-op headlamps does not offer the EL-300.

I ordered 2 of these flimsy tables.  They were not only expensive to ship, but one arrived damaged.  The one that was not damaged in transit would not even open fully, meaning that people's drinks would slide off the table.  These are the most flimsy tables I have ever encountered. If it weren't for the replacement tables I found at costco, the party I planned would have been a disaster.

I really wanted to like this lantern. It is a nice size and is nicely made at a great price, but the light output is pathetic. The package gives the impression that there are 4 leds in it, but I find that doubtful. The light output is no better than the output from a tiny key fob Princeton Tec or Photon. In fact, I think you could read a map, or a book, play cards, or follow a trail, more easily with one of the tiny key fob lights. I'm returning mine.

I purchased this product from Performance bike to replace a much older (10yr) CatEye wired computer. I have a certain amount of brand loyalty to CatEye because their products are typically of higher quality (almost always manufactured in Japan as opposed to China) and typically last a long time, like the aforementioned 10-year-old cycle-computer. I purchased this product without much hesitation, but was disappointed with the unusually stripped feature set. The CatEye Vectra is missing two critical functions: ride timing, and average speed: features even my 10-year-old Velo2 computer has. It offers only current speed, max, odometer, clock, and trip distance. The overall quality of the unit is good, and I'm sure it will last for years with the solid Japanese construction, but I'll seek another unit because the missing features make it unusable for my purposes. Luckily, the sender unit magnetic pickup is reverse and cross compatible with CatEye's other wireless computers, i.e. it works with my older CatEye Cordless 2 computer also. 

Bottom Line: Pick another CatEye model and watch the feature set carefully

Made of a soft steel, the legs' attachment is a bit flimsy, so it leans forward too much. 
May not accommodate bikes with disk brakes (the upper hook is too low for the wide frame opening). I had to drill a hole and move the hook closer to the top of the stand to make it hold my 26" mountain bike

I'm in charge of a weekly touch football game where we use an official NFL football from a previous year and I wanted to get another one for backup. I know 'The Duke' is supposed to be the official NFL ball from this year, but there seems to be something wrong with the balls Amazon is shipping. 

The first ball I got from Amazon was hard as a rock, slick as all get out and had poor stitching in the laces. I got a second one and the stitching was a bit better, but it was still hard and slippery. And when it was exposed to rain, the ball stained the hands of everyone who touched it with red coloring. I have no clue if that's to be expected or not since it's all leather but it seems odd.  

In any case, you can grip the ball with a good pair of sticky football gloves, which also help mitigate the pain of catching the ball. So, it is usable and throws a nice spiral but maybe I play ball with a bunch of wussies cuz no one else wants to get near that thing out of fear of breaking their hands (which is kind of annoying given how much i paid for the balls). 

Maybe the footballs just need to be broken in, but I'm not really sure how to do that aside from playing with them, which no one seems to want to do. I've tried to let some air out to make the things more user-friendly, but it doesn't really help. 

Anyway, I find it really hard to believe this is the ball the NFL played with this year. Something about them just seems cheaply made. In any case, I suggest you save some money and go with a decent composite leather ball.

I have been looking for nice Ti set for camping, and finally found it in Amazon at very cheap price! The Ti set is really light and good for backpackers. Unfortunately, I found one my of set (I bought 2 sets) got manufacturing defects, the fork is bent at a smaller angle, which looks quite weird when I stack them together. 
Hope Brunton should do better QA on their products.
Apart from this, the Ti set is quite nice! But buy with your own risk (you never know the angle problem if you buy 1 set only!)

While this rack looks good, and appears well constructed, it's mounting system leaves something to be desired. While attempting to lock this unit down tight enough to keep it from constantly twisting around, I managed to bend the locking lever. Now don't get me wrong, this is mounted on my wife's bike (a cruiser) and has had at most 10 lbs of groceries in the handy basket you can purchase that slides right on. But having to stop every so often to straighten this thing out is quite annoying. I suppose I will end up modifying the locking mechanism to avoid further aggravation. By the way, I have a Delta rear rack on my ATB that mounts to the seat post using a 4 bolt clamp. Much sturdier, and it was much less expensive, as well

i bought this knife for my husband for a christmas gift. at first he was thrilled to get a new one. upon putting the knife on his key ring and trying to use it, he noticed that the blade opens toward the key chain, making it almost impossible (and very uncomfortable) to use. He had to buy another knife that opened the opposite way. He did, however, like the other features, namely the light and the pen.

This item was sent back the sleeping bag was not sent and was on the invoice.  I HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY REFUND CHECK.  This is the first time I have had any problems with items sent on Amazon.  I like Amazon because I can send a personal check and not a credit card.  Please send me my refund.

Very lightweight, fragile, and poorly finished. Not sure what the "hardwood" actually is. It looks oak-like, but is far too lightweight for it's size. It came a bit rough and splintery and only got worse over time. The lacquer or whatever it is that they finished it with developed spiderweb cracks almost immediately and then began to flake off. I only used it for kata; didn't feel safe actually hitting anything with it let alone using it to defend against a weapon for tandem drills. After a few months of very little use, mostly sitting on the rack, it began to develop cracks. Perhaps it wasn't dried properly when they applied the finish? Regardless, the one I received (50" model) was cheap junk. You get what you pay for... Not only not recommended, but downright dangerous if you hit anything with it. Spend a little more to get better quality

Well, i got through about a clip and a half before it started breaking.  First it went from semi-auto to uncontrolled auto, then it just stopped working.  It was pretty cool for a bit, and is pretty light and easy to set up, but I'd suggest looking somewhere else for a pistol

Wow I thought THULE was THE company for this type of stuff.  Boy was I mad after a trip from NJ to SC.  The bag was mounted to my roofrack and was a little noisy (top be expected).  But when I got to SC and opened the bag....the horror!  The inside lining shredded and flaked off on everything!   There were also 2 holes along the to seam!  What a mess...and I couldn't use the bag on the way home....had to ship my stuff home!  I just wrote THULE....we'll see if they come thru for the customer 
Sept. 12, 2005 THULE sent me a replacement, an Escape 2.  Great customer service....but does this mean the Escape is better?  Is the Quest inferior?  There was no coorespondence with the repalcement...I'll try it out this summer

I bought this to replace a C-Strobe light I used as a tail-light on my bicycle.  The C-Strobe was bright, flashed bright enough to make car drivers complain, and waterproof, just not rugged enough to survive being run over by a truck when it fell off my backpack.  This one was by the same manufacturer with "strobe action" and 1/3 the cost.

It doesn't flash, the "strobe action" is the way it appears to flash as you go in and out of the side ring of light.  It isn't anywhere near as bright as the C-Strobe.  I'm going to get a C-Strobe later this month from a local boating dealer

I was very disappointed with the Ironman Speed Jump Rope. It is made of cheap plastic and, even after a month of hanging from my 2nd floor banister with a weight on the end, it's still coiled and kinked. It's impossible to jump with it as you never know when one of the kinks will bump the bottom of your foot. I would not buy it again, even for the low price charged by Amazon

This Bobber Cooler is definitely a conversation piece.  I have had so many comments about it. I used it when floating down a small river near home (No Rapids, just calm water), it doesn't hold its weight, literally. The first thing is that the opening is in the center of the cooler, making it impossible to get drinks out with out pulling the whole cooler out of the water.  The opening seam rides just barely about the water, and since it is round the weight shifts a little and the seam will dip into the water. The cooler then fills up with water, which almost immediatly melts the ice, and as it fills up it will sink to the bottom.  maybe if there was a rubber gasket to seal it better, it might be ok.  The 2 plastic clasps on each side used to close the cooler are really easy to break off, plus they are facing the wrong direction. If you bump something like a rock or a log, it will push the clasp back and then unlatch the cooler.

This cooler might be good to use in bodys of water that do not have current, like a pool, but I don't suggest towing it behind anything.  I suggest using one of the many inflateble coolers on the market

 The only way other people can thnk it is a good gun is because when they first get it they look and say, cool. well it cant even shoot, so its not cool. this isnt just mine either its all of them cause it cant shoot because its made by the cheapest plastic, and i looked inside its only held together by the outside. the laser is off target (and sucks)and it shots as fast as u can throw it, if it shoots. I had this for about ten minutes before i thought that i got 13 dollars ript off. it fell apart after 1 hour. it couldnt shoot after 5 minutes.Dont get this gun cause it isnt just mine its the way its made. those othe reviews are people who probly dont ever use it and probly never have used it

It is NOT worth the money. It broke the first day I got it and with the silencer and all that crap it doesn't shoot. The BBs fall out the front. It jammed like 6 times before it broke. This gun is somewhat accurate but doesnt hurt at all. It sucks a lot. Don't buy any products from HotImport Toys, they are cheap, worthless, and extremely breakable

I never write reviews, but I had to make my comments on these socks. I bought them to keep my feet warm at me desk at work.  I put them on and turned the switch to high.  They DO NOT EVEN GET WARM at all...I thought it was broken, but realized it was both socks that didn't get warm. These are a total rip off and I am going to try and send them back.

If you study Pilates then you will see how the performers do not have the proper body positions. One of the girls keeps staring at the camera for no reason and moving her body when it should be still.

As a lover of Pilates and how much it has done for me, I urge you to buy something else

Used once. Unit Blew a fuse. No manufacturer supplied info on fuse and none on the fuse body. No contact information was provided by manufacturer or seller. Had to calculate fuse rating.
Unit is very slow to make coffee.
Power plug does not fit well in 12V accessory recepticles. Does not go deep enough into recepticle to hold itself in place, has a tendency to pop out of the recepticle.
No return information provded.
Considering all the problems, I would not buy another product from this manufacturer, nor would I recommend it to anyone else. Unit is overpriced

I'm sure the mat would have been fine, but they mixed up my order, and this company does not refund shipping, which was almost the price of the mat-- lame

When I first got the bike, I thought it was great. By 2nd ride the chain broke while I was trying to do a simple down shift. Unfortunately it also took out the shimano shifter mechanism which equates to big bucks in repair cost. Looking at the metal used it is no wonder it didn't last. Very poor quality. Too bad, because it is a great looking bike. I guess I'll give Wal Mart a try next.........

Bought this for my son.  He loved it and played with it a lot for about a week.  Then the wheels broke.  He wasn't doing anything unusual with the board just riding it back and forth on the driveway.  The wheels seemed to warp and twist making them unstable

What this is is a cheap skateboard, with a cheap metal bar stuck through it, with some Dora stuff pasted on last minute.

Within the first day of using this, the Dora sticky-paper they put on the bottom of the skateboard (where your child puts their feet) was torn.  Within two days, it was nearly completely destroyed.   I tried to fix this with elmer's glue, but to no avail.

Now I have a 'plain' scooter...

I've seen this thing on sale for less than a ten-spot, it MIGHT be worth that price, but not any more..

Nothing against these particular paddles, but avoid cheap paddles. If you splurge on any item in your kayak budget it should be the paddles. If you paddle, you will develop a close relationship with your paddles - it can either be a good one or a bad one. You can markedly improve your paddling experience with a relatively small increase in spending. Good paddles will make you want to use your kayak

This piece is really quite over-priced for what you get, though not having the knife allows you to bring this on a plane with you.  I've seen this unit marketed elsewhere as a "travel-friendly" Swiss Army tool (not knife).

Nevertheless, the unit I have is the 64MB version of:
ASIN: B0002VM8ZM
...which costs considerably less (~$30) on Amazon, has the same 128MB USB drive and red light as the unit on this page, plus you get a small quantity of Swiss Army tools INCLUDING a knife.  Unless you are concerned about going on a plane, I'd recommend the ASIN: B0002VM8ZM over the unit on this page.  BTW, I got my handy little 64MB unit (which I'd give four stars for if I had the option) for only $9.99 on clearance at Target.

Maybe I should read the description better, but I was disapointed to find out, when receiving it, that this is JUST a USB Key with a pen and anemic led light.

No "swiss army stuff". Not even a knife. I thought all swiss army knives are supposed to have, you know, a knife? 

That said, the USB key is very tiny, almost too small on its own (detached from the swiss army non-knife housing), so it's good it has a "home" within the casing, otherwise it would probably go missing

I live in northern California, so rain is nothing new to me.  I've been putting off getting a large umbrella for quite some time now, but since I signed up for free Amazon Prime, I figure I'd buy everything I've been wanting for 30 straight days.  This umbrella made my list because I've read some decent reviews on it, plus it's affordable but I guess you get what you pay for.  The first umbrella came and the tip was split.  I ask for a replacement from Amazon which arrived next day (nice service) however, I wish this umbrella is as good as Amazon's service, because the replacement umbrella also arrived damaged.  Except this one is far worse; the entire tip is missing.  Since this is the replacement, Amazon will only do a refund.  By the way I'm STILL without an umbrella

I've been looking for weight lifting gloves, and trying out gloves that seemed to work for me but either bled onto my hands or ripped.  These gloves, however, dried out my hands and made me use lots of moisturizers.  They also tore down the knuckles on my left hand and in between the thumbs.  Weighlifting gloves are yes supposed to keep your hands dry during work outs and to prevent calases.  These gloves dried out my hands completely and gave me calases.  If you want a good pair of gloves do not get these

It may say "Slow Cooker" on the front of the item, but I assure you, it is anything but slow! I was looking for a crock pot for camping using propane and was told this was the item for me! 

So, I made my Hungarian Ghoulash in it, glad that the night meal would be done in 8-10 hours when we got back from the beach. All I can say is, thank goodness my husband noticed that it was bubbling inside of the cooker a half hour later, or we wouldn't have had anything but charcoal left, had we left the campsite that day without checking it! It was cooking on low, and it was literally done in a half hour's time. So, keep in mind, if you are camping and you haven't tried using this product yet, it won't take long before your meal is done. 

Sadly, my crock pot recipes were put away for the rest of that trip- the campground we were at didn't have electricity, hence why I wanted a propane crock pot.

This is the second Nike watch I ordered. The first one did not work and Isent it back to Amazon. Amazon was great and sent me new one. This one worked for a few days. I then had the battery replaced . Two weeks after it stopped working. By that time I had thrown out the box etc and now it is sitting in the basket in my kitchen. I have hopes to return it but it seems to much of a problem to explain. I am am glad I have had this opportunity to vent.
In short, the watch is awful.

After ridding a only a couple of times this bike began to fall apart. The brakes were faulty to begin with which were repaired soon after purchase. While ridding on an easy trail the seat broke off half way through the ride. With out a seat I had to walk the bike back to the car. I advise extra caution for first time bikers and do a check to make sure all the components are working.

I have an original thighmaster I purchased years ago...thinking this Thighmaster Gold was going to be similar I purchased it to take to work with me.  It is very flimsy-it seems to be made of very light weight material that is not going to hold up. My old thighmaster is very sturdy-I have been using it for years and it looks fairly new.  This one will be ready for the trash can in less than a year.  Save your money

First of all I'd like to say how much I loved my Thighmaster.  I got one four months ago from a Sportmart and it has been part of my daily routine ever since. I have much better thigh muscles and a lot more confidence in myself because that little invention made of foam and an industrial strength coil. With that said, I have a slightly amusing and mildly alarming anecdote for you.
I was just beginning my strength training exercises and I had just done my second rep with the Thighmaster and all of the sudden I heard a loud pop and it fell to the ground . . . IN TWO PIECES! Now there are two things that immediately crossed my mind, "Wow man, my thighs must made of STEEL!"  and the other more likely scenario "Wow man, it fell apart after four months, this must be an inferior product."  Anyway I e-mailed SuzanneSommers.com in hopes that it was a fluke and that I had gotten the one crumby thighmaster.  I asked them if it was possible to replace it, and sadly although I only owned it four months I was told " It may be time for a new thigh master as the product is not designed to last forever."   Last time I checked, four months is NOT anywhere near forever.  A year, six months maybe, but when you divide the cost of a thighmaster by the amount of time I owned it, the costs outweighs the benefits.  It is even less comforting that the company wasn't surprised or alarmed by their product's short lifespan.  It seemed that if four months is akin forever to the people at suzannesomers.com, then the product's usage expectancy is not much more than that.  It makes me unhappy to have ruined such a handy little device with normal wear and tear, but I can't really afford to buy a new one every four months.  I just wanted to give everyone a heads up and let you know that although it is theoretically a great product, the durability is highly dubious.  And the suzannesomers.com, who referred me to the manufacturer's warrantee only think that a thighmaster should work for three months maximum.

Does the unit work??,...Well yes to a degree. It takes 6 holes to lock on to the satellites and then does a fair job of giving distances. The display is poor and though they say "up to 40 objects per hole" there is normally 2-4 objects per hole. All this depends upon the Skycaddie course recorder. The user (you) can not modify the course or add any objects that the  course recorder didn't think was important.
Now the bad part. The unit attaches via button and belt clip (like a cell phone). My button (part that attaches to main unit) has died twice in the first 30 days. When it breaks again,...which it will often,..the unit will probally hit the dirt. This isn't good. But fear not. It will be packed away weeks trying to get in touch with Skygolf. And another week to get a replacement button (which has been modified even weaker than the original one). Now my replacement broke on the first time I clipped it to the belt. Now back to Skycaddie to get another. After being on hold for another hour, they need to transfer you to another tech that handles parts. This will take another hour. You then get a message to leave a message. Normally within a week someone will call you back. By normally I mean about 35% of the time you leave messages they return them. Would I buy another,... duh,.... NO

I got this POS for Christmas because I was excited by the ad, the concept, and Natalie Gulbis.  It' a neat idea and I love gadgets.  Upon removing it from the box it looks and feels cheap, like a happy meal toy cell phone.  Cheap plastic and a poor LCD screen.  If that were it, I could live with it, but I can not get this thing to connect to the website to down load the necessary software.  I have been trying all day, from different computers, and still nothing.  I call the support number, sit on hold for about fifteen minutes and then it just hangs up on you.  This is a fairly expensive toy.  You would think SkyGolf would spens a little less money on advertising and a little more on R& D.  This thing is junk.  Stick with a Bushnell 1500 PinSeeker instead.  Traditional rangefinder, but it works great.  Nothing to crash, no support needed, and IT WORKS!!!  I am sending this expensive piece of junk back first t hing tomorrow.  The sad thing is, SkyGolf is destroying its image and reputation.  If they had put a little more effort into their development, and actually had someone there to answer the phones, this could have been a really nead golf tool that people wouldn't mind paying for.  The annual $20 membership fee is no problem, if it works.  Right now, I wouldn't pay $20 for the unit its self, let alone the membership.  Don't waste your money on this... well, I was going to call it an expensive paper weight, but it wouldn't even work for that... it weighs about as much as a sheet of card stock.

The cardboard shipping container for this bike was broken through and open in several places, which could have been the result of poor design of the packaging and/or inept handling by the shipping company.  A fender was bent and some of the paint was scratched.  The front brake was difficult to adjust because there did not seem to be enough wire.  A required tool, a 5mm allen wrench, was not provided. I have not attempted to adjust the gears because it seems too complicated, however, the bike seems to perform adequately as is.

As the previous reviewer said, I can see this being passable as a one player score keeper. But don't make a mistake, it's impossible to correct. If it is possible, I don't know how as there are no directions. Using it for more than one player is tedious and not practical. With the buttons the way they are, its going to get bumped and errors made. And you probably won't even know it.

Just a horrible design and a waste of money

Overall the item works well.  If keeping track of one player it is just fine.  When trying to play two players it is hard to get from one player to the second player.  To play two players it has to go through all four players before getting back to the first player and then to keep strokes as they happen it is difficult to go back from player one and player two

I bought this for my mountain bike with large suspension forks.  I tried the instructions to find the proper placement of the sensor but that was useless as it just has a picture for this part.  No recommendations for proper location.  Then I found the only way the system would register a rotation is to have the magnet touch the sensor.  So now I have an annoying clicking and am wondering when it will actualy break from the constant contact.  Going to send it bac

To describe these as "light and cheap" is exactly right.  And neither is a compliment.  My Thera-band handles started crumbling after only a few weeks of regular (3 or 4 times a week) use.  The foam rubber on the handles is obviously cheap quality and started fraying at the edges.  After picking up several chunks of foam off the floor, I learned that tying my own handles at the end of the Thera-band stretch bands works better -- and is free.

These handles simply are not sturdy or well-made enough to hold up for the use they are intended for.  Save your money

My Mom wrecked badly on this the first time out, due to the difficult-to-control steering.  Very awkward handle bars...several of us tried to ride it.  My friend--a fitness pro & personal trainer--put it best by saying "That's the most uncomfortable bike I've ever ridden." 
Mom ended up giving it to a charity bike drive.  I hope somebody likes it. :-

If you decide to purchase this bicycle, may I offer some advice.  If your bicycle arrives missing a part, please immediately return it to the store where it was purchased.  My wife's bicycle arrived minus the front fender with bolt.  The folks at the Customer Service Department at Pacific Cycle were understanding and said that I would receive the missing parts with 10 business days.  After two weeks passed, I called again, this time the parts were on backorder.  Curious, I asked why I wasn't told that two weeks earlier.  "You have to dig down in our system", was the answer.
I asked when I might receive the missing parts.  "Could be two or three more months", she replied.  When I suggested that two months was a long time, she said something I didn't expect, "You know, there's no reason that you can't ride the bicycle without the fender"

I would like to tell you my opinion of the bike, but I never even got to see it.  The company that amazon uses to ship the bike (Eagle freight) lost my bike (even with a tracking number!) They refused to admit this after several rounds of calling and waiting on hold. Even the supervisor never returned my phone call. I explained the situation to amazon and they were very helpul and offered to send out a replacement immediately, but unfortunately they would only send it by Eagle, so I took the refund.  If you want to pay a small amount for a bike, buy it here.  If you want to actually own a bike and ride it, buy it somewhere else

I've been using harbinger since mid-90's and all of them share the same problem: after a few months the begin to smell like wet rag, a recurring odor after handwash, machinewash, sun exposure. I am embarassed to use them. This particular model is in its second year of use at first, they seemed too bulky to completely clench your fist without some feeling of vascular obstruction an effect exacerbated by the rubber pieces that form the non-slippery grip; sometimes i prefered to use my basic pair without all that fancy stuff. Now that some rubber has fallen they feel better. As of now they are dismembering at the seams, they still smell bad (3-4 working sessions a week, &lt;2 hours, good care).  I am moving to another brand hopping they will behave better maybe GoFit or Valeo or Nike. Try neoprene perhaps

I have had very bad experiences with this company in the past.  There is absolutely no support for any repair to their products whatsoever.  If there's a problem in the first 90 days, you're fine.  After that, you're up the creek - and this is particularly true of any item with electronics in it.  As all their components are manufactured in Asia, they have no way of repairing or replacing any component of your items should anything go wrong with them in time.

Be very careful with these people, as you're likely to pay a lot of money for a very pretty, non-functioning bookend

We bought this boat 4 years ago when my oldest (of three) was a baby.  I totally agree with the others who have said that it is tippy and not safe.  We only used it a couple of times because he would just pitch forward or from side to side.  We used it when he was between 5 and 9 months old and able to sit up, and still had this problem. Maybe an older, much more stable child could use it, but it is advertised for use with infants and it's just not worth the trouble of trying to balance your baby in this thing

I bought this boat for my son when he was 8 months old.  He liked the boat well enough...even played with it when it was sitting on dry land.  However, in the water, this boat is VERY tippy, requiring two adult hands AT ALL TIMES.  Not good if you have more than one kid and NEED that extra hand.  I bought a much sturdier boat that still of course needs constant supervision but is great and can be used for more than one summer.  I wouldn't recommend anyone put their baby in this boat

Small holes, unstable, no space for the bum. My daughter cried everytime we tried it. We had a Pool School deluxe baby float before but we left it at the pool and it dissapeared. She loved that one. I could not find it in the store so I bought the Swim School and am regretting it.
Buy the Pool School!

Then when I sent an e-mail trying to exchange the product, no one returns my calls or e-mails me back, after so long of trying it's already past the 30 day exchange policy.

This bed was a real disappointment from the beginning. We actually thought we had received the wrong bed because there certainly is nothing like memory foam on it. It's just a fabric cover, perhaps with an extra layer of material, but it CAN'T be foam. Maybe only 1/4" thick at most. Then, after 4 months some of the inner cells must have separated because there was a 4" rise on both the top and bottom of a cell area and it felt like more were starting to detach internally. BAD BED

The product information states that this bed has 1 inch of memory foam, they must round that number up to the closest inch because there was maybe 1/2 inch.  We didn't even bother to blow the thing up, utter junk, returned for something cheaper and better put together (we hope). if I could give this a negative star rating I would.

and after using it a few time si relized its flaws 
first its too damn small 
its accurcy is not bad but its velocity is utter crap 
and doenst do squat in heavy battles
and the clip is a reduiclus system of   shaking the rounds form teh clips into the spring ssystem 

buy this for collections and maybe for soem fun but not a good gun and it jammed after the first month and i broke it trying to fix it

Both me and the mat slide all over the place. It has no traction whatsoever and is absolutely not suitable for anyone who does yoga on a regular basis.

There was a click in the crankshaft that was loud enough to be heard while riding and felt by the foot through the left pedal every 360 degrees of pedal rotation.

I purhased a crank puller tool for $21.44 (incl tax), a crank wrench for $18.18 (incl. tax), and grease for $6.38 to repair this brand new bicycle.

Upon disassembly I found two (2) metal shavings, each about 0.25 inches in size, that appeared to be from drilling.  I have saved the two (2) metal shavings.

I removed the metal shavings, cleaned and re-greased, and the clicking noise and vibration was fixed.

Since this was a brand new bicycle, it would seem reasonable to reimburse me for the tools required to repair it.  The total cost, not including and labor, is $46.00.

The day we received the stroller we were very excited. We put the stroller together which was very simple per instruction.  However, when we took the stroller out of the entryway of our house the elbow of the stroller where the stroller folds caught the underarm of the babies skin and pinched it into the elbow. Of course it tore the skin and the baby was screaming. We have not used the stroller again and we are still trying to resolve this issue with the company.  I would not reccommend this double jogger to anyone at this time

I saw this ad on TV today and about to purchased from here at Amazon instead of zone pilates' web site. I kept reading reviews and one reviewer (Evelyn from FL) mentined that the ring would not stay on the body. Actually, I was thinking the same. I was about to purchase and saw s/h fees (about $15). Also her "Keep on looking" and I did. I found out "Everlast for Her Pilates Fitness Ring with DVD" here at amazon for only $14.99 (ASIN: B00091RYZY ) and "Bally Fitness Ring for Pilates with DVD" $17.99 (ASIN: B000H3YNR6 ). Both are very identical to this zone pilates and eligible for FREE Super Saver Shipping on orders over $25. Sorry, my review will not be helpful for the seller of this zone pilates but maybe for actual customers, like me.

PS. I have similar pilates rubber resistant ring and it doesn't stay put on the body, especially near the hip. It is good for toning my legs though. I really want the butts from the models of Zone's commercial. Maybe I can try with Everlast ring with half price.

Update 1/11/07: I received my Everlast ring yesterday. The physical ring is very identical to this Zone ring but actual workouts are quite different. I really like Zone's workouts from commercial (you can also watch again from their website), especially for buns & thights. I wish I can purchase just DVD from Zone with low s/h :)

Update 1/16/07: I'd also purchased this Zone Pilates from Walmart (~$25+7 s/h) and received it yesterday. It was a huge mistake! The ring is very identical to Everlast, not any better (rather slightly heavier). The accompanied DVD has only 2 workouts and they last only about 10 min. and the second workout is slightly modified from the first one. They were not as effective as Everlast's workout DVD, which is more precise and has better menu. The instructor from this Zone Pilates, Kim Stoneman, has flabby belly and sloping buttocks! It seems like she is not using her own ring unless it's not effective as advertised and she proved that! Very un-motivating for me! She stands in front of a still camera so we cannot see particular movements from different angle (unlike Everlast, you can see those). Zone Pilates advertised with a different model with pretty body but you cannot see her in the workout DVD. Don't waste your money to belive the commercial and purchase this Zone. I'll return mine to Walmart ASAP

be forwarned, that this is more for isolated toning legs, arms, shoulders.hips,  rather than pilates workout. does not strengthen the core muscles like pilates does and may weaken them.  The trainer on the dvd has flabby abs, and thick torso,  rather than long lean muscles and core muscle strength that is usually found when doing pilates workouts. i found the equipment bulky and awkward to use, hard to hold my body in good alignment and almost impossible to do the exercises from my power center, very disappointed in dvd training that accompanies the set. and serious questions about whether this routine weakens the abs, after my experience with it and seeing the condition of the abds of the trainer.  It is not up to the caliber of what I have come to expect from pilates. also feel there is risk of injury related to difficulty of holding body in correct alignment, as equipment kept slipping down or up. Need to go back to the drawing board on this one, there are better, less expensive, better made options out there, with better training. Keep on looking.

I just got mine 3 days ago. I can see that it might help toning the areas. And the video is not annoying. What is a problem is the WONDERFUL bruising on my legs where the device sits for the workout. I didn't purchase this item for weight loss, I thought it would help for toning. But the bruises, while they may go away with continued use, are not worthe the $$. I am sending mine back today. Sorry

I purchased this bike from a local dealer 15 months ago and it has broken down 3 times in the last 15 months. The resistence motor is defective which is what I have had replaced 3 times now. This motor does not allow you to change gears or bike through a program--upgrading to shifiting on the fly technology would be a plus. 
The positive aspect of the bike is the comfort and grip heart rate monitor and the ability to swap out saddles also a plus. Ovewrall I cannot recommend this product.

Okay, here's the bottom line.  If you're just getting into airsoft, this could be an okay gun for backyard can shooting or whatnot.  But if you're actually looking to get into the sport competitively, look for a Classic Army or Tokyo Marui AUG.  It will be more expensive, but it will be quality.  The number one rule of the airsoft world is: You get what you pay for.  This is a cheap gun, and it's going to perform like a cheap gun.  If you're looking for a decent cheap gun, let me recommend the UTG Warhawk, UTG MP5 or some of the CYMA MP5 line

Graber should be ashamed of themselves for this product... This rack will scrape the paint right off your bike; the arms of the rack that fold closed pop out of place with a bike on the rack sliding your bike around; the rack itself does not stay in place despite trying bungee cords, ratchet tie-downs, etc.  This was a complete and total waste of money - AND damaged my bike.  On top of all that, it is NOT an inexpensive rack!  Save yourself aggravation and choose a different rack..

I got this Heart rate monitor and the strap was way too small so I had to order a replacement strap when I went to change the strap the battery was dead the battery lasted only 1 week.  so I had to buy 2 new batteries one for the watch and one for the chest strap and now there is a line of pixels out on the screen of the watch.  I am going to get a forerunner those seem allot better.  I was very disappointed with this my Suunto dive computer is great this HRM sucks.

Face is made of cheap plastic - it scratched within an hour of putting it on.  Watch had about 20 scratches and dimples after 2 weeks.  I've been wearing a cheap Casio for the last two years that hardly has a scratch on it.  Other problems include- the buttons press very easily making the watch change functions constantly, for example when I put my hand in my pocket or put on a coat; also, the functionality of the watch is not very intuitive, with five buttons it should be much easier to move through the different functions of the watch.  Finally, the watch is very well photographed in the ad, and doesn't look any nicer than my cheap casio in reality

Brutal, horrible instructions! No pictures! No clear, concise steps to follow.   It took 2 people to set up and just as previous reviewers mentioned, nothing fits properly.  It's very flimsy and unsteady.  I was extremely frustrated and dissapointed in this product so I returned it.  Don't waste your time and money. Spend a little more and get a better product.

Positive:
 -Size, good surface area
 -Chipping net

Negatives:
 -Poor instructions
 -Very hard to set up by yourself.  Really takes 2 people, because nothing fits tight, so as you try to get one side in, the other side pops out.
 -Nothing locks in.  Plastic caps to hold rear poles don't fit tightly.  The 'male' sticks that go into the 'female' section of the rear poles are not tight, so a wind from the rear pushes it over.

I have had to make some modifications to this item to make it usable.  I taped some eyelets to the bottom of the rear poles and attached to ring with caribiners.  I've had to tape the caps onto the top of the rear poles and add some tape to the ends of the front pole to make it snug

I purchased this screen arbor for protective coverage outside but the material portion is hard to fit over the piping to tie it down. Next the  piping that holds the form is not at all sturdy. the first time the wind picked up, it blew the whole thing apart. So for a one time use it is okay...The money spent on this was a waste. It also looked in places like it had already been repaired. (seconds) as in 2nd class merchandise

I never got to use the product. Upon opening, I realized the sizing details on Amazon's website was different than the one on the box. I am 5'5" and the 65cm was too big for me although Amazon states it's just my size

The reason  I gave it one star is because of how it affected my body. I am an athletic person and very agile, but this is one of the workouts that I will never do again. 

I have arthritis and that causes major joint pain and this workout focused all the pain unto my joints in my knees and I was in tears. I had to stop this workout about 5 minutes into it. My knees were hurting for almost 3 days after and I could hardly walk.

I'm sure if you are in perfect health this might work for you, but if you have any type of arthritis or any joint pain, please stay away from the ball workout.

I agree with the previous reviews that say Hydrocoach is not accurate.  Instructions say to take deliberate sucks. Even with that, not all ounces register.  It might only register 12-16 ounces after filling the 22 ounce bottle.  I like gadgets but this $30 water bottle is not worth it.  It would have been better if you fill up the bottle and press a button when you drink all the water in it adding 22 ouonces each time

I agree with the other reviewers that the idea for this product was going in the right direction, but took a bad turn somewhere. I get lightheaded trying to suck hard enough on the straw for it to register, and even when it does it is consistently 8 to 10 ounces off the mark of what I've actually consumed. And if you're really thirsty, forget it - you'll pass out before ever getting enough fluid to quench your thirst. At $30, it's a hefty price to pay when it's much simpler to just refill a 20-ounce plastic bottle 3 times a day. Sorry to say I'll be returning my HydraCoach

I was extremely disappointed in this item.
I think it is a good concept, but it doesn't work well at all.  it says on the back that you have to take big sips for it to register that you are really drinking it.  I tried to really take big sips and it would barely register that I drank anything.  it is awkward to drink from too.  I can not believe this thing was really tested out by people before it went on the market.  not worth buying.  just buy a regular water bottle for a fraction of the cost and save yourself the aggravation

The first unit was installed as directed and when it was working it was fine. The problem was it would just stop working and this was most of the time. I exchaned several e-mails with customer service rep Pat. She was extremely nice and suggested I send it back for a replacement.

The second unit was installed as directed and worked flawlessly for a couple of months. It now works a bit better than the first one. Instead of stops working most of the time, this one stops working some of the time. I have decided to keep this one because of the bother and expense of shipping it back for a replacement. And who knows, the next unit may not work at all.

Not a good product for Amazon to be selling.

I am not a big spender, but unlike a lot of things, the more money you spend, the better bike you get.  I really didn't want to spend a lot for a bike for a 5-year-old, and I wish I would have gone with my first instinct and bought one from a bike shop.  I'm so frugal that I couldn't stand the idea of paying $140 for a bike for a kid, so I got this one instead (which was actually more expensive when I bought it.)  This is a mediocre bike at best, MAYBE one step above a big box store bike, just maybe.  I wanted a simple bike that would last while, but I will be surprised if this one makes it one summer.  Paint chips easily and the white bike seat is clean for only the first few minutes out of the box.  The components seem cheap and the frame does not seem very solid.  The difference between this one and a good (expensive) bike is huge.  I had a bike shop put it together and I added a basket, so the difference between what I paid for this and what I would have paid for a good bike was about $30.  I'm kicking myself now.

You've got a lot of ab-rollers. You need a gimmick: The product is  no better than the competition. You don't have an ad budget. What do you do?  CHARGE FOUR TIMES AS MUCH. Then just sit and wait for the 'clients' who are looking for a 'quality' product to assume that the high price actually means something

I bought mine at the same Toys R' Us Sale and had the exact same issue. Both my husband and I own Trek bikes and it wouldn't work his bike at all. It fit on mine only to find out that my heels would hit the footrest of the carrier. I woulud only recommend buying if you have the patience to install it on your bike only to find out that it won't work comfortably while you're riding. Not to mention that my two year old is very tall and he didn't look comfortable in it anyway. The free helmet is way too small for his head. We've returned it and have yet to purchase a different one yet. I think we're going to a bike shop

I bought this seat for $40 on sale at toys-r-us, since it stated it would fit "most" bikes.  I followed the directions that came with the seat, and that made it impossible to install on both bikes that I tried it on.  After several choice words and approximately 2 1/2 hours later per bike (5 hours total), I finally had this piece of crap installed, only to find out that both my and my wife's heels grinded against the footrests of the seat.  DO NOT buy this piece of crap, it is not worth any amount of money as far as i'm concerne

I was desperate for a fast way to get my youngest child to the park when my older children ride their bicycles. Unfortunately the only thing in stock anywhere was this seat. And it took me all morning to get it put together. The holes for the straps to go into were so small I had to widen them with a screwdriver and shove them through the holes with the screwdriver as well. The screws to attach the seat to the seat post of my bike were too short, and the washers needed to be pried together. Finally I was nearing the final steps, when lo and behold, I was missing a piece.  I call customer support, which is at Bell, not Fisher Price or Mattel. I was on hold for 20 minutes before I was able to speak to anyone.  Then when I spoke to the representative, she put me on hold to speak to her supervisor for another 15 minutes. This happened twice. Their solution to my missing piece? Use a zip tie, "We don't ship that piece separately."  

Excuse me? You make a mistake, you fix it. Regardless of whether or not "the piece is shipped separately. Ridiculous. And at the end of the conversation, there was no apology offered, no attempt to make the situation right. Ugh.

So now, I have nothing to show for my morning of effort.

Also, I attempted to adjust the strap on the seat to see how it would fit my daughter. I sat her in the seat, and she BARELY fits. She is two years old, barely weighs 23 pounds, and is tiny. I have no idea how a child any bigger than her would even fit in the seat. I had hoped to use this seat for family rides for the nextfew years. That would NOT happen with this seat.

So, it is going back to the store, and I am buying a Kettler Flipper, or a Bobike Maxi, or a Topeak.  I will steer clear of Bell products in the future!

Oh, and to top it all off, the helmet provided with the seat has the plastic cover peeling off without me even removing it from the packaging!! Worthless.

Save your time and your money, avoid this seat at all costs

I found the size range to be completely missleading. My child was just shy of 5 and weighs 42lbs. She is 42 inches tall and found herself to big for this seat. Her legs were right up against my seat and was very uncomfortable.  The bottom line if she is this uncomfortable at her age what would a 7 year old be

We bought this for our 2 year old daughter.  It was a nightmare to put together, then it did not fit.  Becareful when installing in larger mountain bikes.  We bought a 20inch frame, men's mountain mike and it was 3 inches too short of fitting.  Not worth it!!

If you search for the keyword 'Illuminator LED Flashlight', you'll find that this same item is offered from varies sources at wildly different prices. So naturally, you should just go for the lowest price, right? Not so fast...

I already bought one Illuminator flashlight elsewhere (see my "Customer Images' above), and was going to order a few more as gifts. The lowest price I found here is from 'IGgFactory Handhelditems' at $7.95. But during checkout, I found out that their standard shipping and handling fee is $8.21 for just one item. The flashlight itself weights only 7 oz., but the company charges 4 lb. for shipping weight. What a rip-off!

With such inflated shipping cost, you may be better off buying this item from local drug stores (such as Walgreen) for $15. At least there you can return the item easily if you're not happy with it.


[Update on Jan 21, 2007]:
Please check out my review for the Garrity Power Lite, where I have made a comparison betweeen it and the Illuminator. It is my opinion that the Garrity is a better flashlight.

In my opinion, this thing is flimsy and worthless.  I set it up in the doorway and it is so poorly designed that it just doesn't hold.  Once you bring the bar crashing into your forehead on your first or second chin-up, you realize that you've already thrown away your money and now it's time to throw away this product.  I ABSOLUTELY agree with the reviewer who cautions against making this product available to kids without close supervision

I've had my Suunto Advizor for 16 months. I am now in Iraq and the bezel is broken-off, like the other reviewer. I dont have my receipt. You can go to the Suunto website, but one thing you won't find there is an address with a note that says: 

"send your broken expensive plastic watch here and we will fix it."

My G-shock, by comparison,lasted longer than I wanted it to and cost one-quarter of what the Suunto cost.

So I give the Suunto one star, for being adventure-cool for a while. A lot of other Infantrymen own these, so I jumped on the bandwagon. I wish I had stuck with a regular watch and a GPS (with lensatic compass backup).

This is the first review that i have done on amazon. So far i have purchased over a dozen items on Amazon and by and large i have been content/happy with all of them except this product.

This product is made of a cheap hard plastic and the assembly socket for one of the bars actually cracked when it was assembled.

DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Shell out about five bucks more for all metal push-up bars

I held high hopes for the product - being that I live in a little apartment in NYC, I was looking forward to saving space.  The tune-up stand is little/portable, however it was not too sturdy.  The bike, while on the stand, will not withstand much torque at all.  The bike fell over many times before I gave up and purchased another bigger/more sturdy stand.  Forget about turning the crank, the slightest movement of the crank creates too much torque for the little stand and the bike falls over.  This stand would be good for LIGHT work - possibly a light tuning of the brakes or a wipe down with a rag. Any pressure whatsoever would necessitate a bracing hand on the frame of the bike.  Overall a 2/5 because it may be okay for a little person's bike or a bmx.  I used it on a men's road bike size 57.

You cannot sit upright in this chair. Bad for soccer games (why we bought it). The chair is designed to lean back. THe company is not Amazon and would not take back without more postage charges than the chair is worth. Unless you plan to sleep in this chair, it stinks

I got one of these because it was only a penny. I used it several times with only a slight crack that I later cemented. Later I used it again, and, while cocking it back, the whole top piece just splintered into many pieces. The gun is fun for about the first few tries then it's prone to jamming up. Even though it was only a penny, it was $4.99 shipping. I'm better off getting one for about a dollar at a flea market. I'm not very satisfied, but I'm not spending 40 cents to get my 1 penny back

I just saw this toy in Parents Magazine Sunday night and was so excited to see it on sale at Target this week. I ran to get it since my [...] son is too short to use his hand-me-down red tricycle. It looked like lots of fun in the picture, however, my son is too big for it! I don't know why it states that it is suitable for up to 3 years old- no way! If it were adjustable, I'm sure he would have loved it, but just like another reviewer stated- it's just like the other ride-on toys we already own. Currently, the Scuttle Bug is in the trunk ready to be returned to the store. How disappointing

 I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son's airoft rifle as a Christmas gift. The screws were too short to attach it to his Kitty Kat ( a shortened M-4) airsoft rifle's weaver rail. Yes, I could go out and find screws the proper length, but I though I'd make Airsplat do their job. 

So, after several e-mails with the service department, they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size. Wrong. The diameter of the new screws is so big they won't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight. Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws. 
 
Why by a gun from these guys? If it arrives broken, you pay to ship it back. Want a refund? You pay a 15% restocking fee. Take a pass on Airsplat.

I ordered this sleeping bag on 12/07/06, I chose standard shipping which is 3 to 5 days. This was more then enough time I needed to have the sleeping bag arrive before Christmas. Here it is 01/10/07, and still the sleeping bag has not arrived. My account says it was shipped on 12/11/06. When I track the item it says expected delivery date is 01/31/07. Nothing was EVER stated when I placed the order that the delivery date would be 01/31/07. Only 3 - 5 days. This is the most ridiculous thing I ever heard! I had other items placed with this order that I have received off and on out of the blue before and after Christmas. There are 3 all together that I NEVER received at ALL from TARGET. I counted on these items for Christmas and I am very disappointed with AMAZON and TARGET. I have done alot of business with Amazon and in the future I will NEVER, NEVER give any of my business to AMAZON if the order is connecrted to TARGET in any way!!!! TARGET & AMAZON deserve 0 stars for terrible service, and false advertisement!

Ive never done a review before because I have never been so disgusted with a product.

Ive had mine a few weeks. Used it twice a week.. which equals roughly 10 uses so far. Well, just now the little knob that gets screwed in to hoold the arm in place to prevent it from swinging BROKE.. cracked right in half as I was turning it with my fingers. I didnt even put any weight into it!!

Last week the nut that holds the eye hook and entire weight of the heavy bag fell off sending my bag crashing to the ground. I dont know why they wouldnt put something more permanent up there instead of a 2 cent nut.

The design is terrible. Rather than have the supports and screw holes run the length of the wall studs they have then run so you  mount two in the studs two in the drywall.. unless of course you do the wood mount like another user suggested ( which is what I did ).

TKO just lost me. I will NEVER buy ANYTHING from them again. Seventy dollars for this CHinese made garbage. Im sure the welds will be the next thing to go. 

Buyer bewar

This is a nice bag with a fatal flaw.  The major zippers break very easily.  After my first bag broke within a few months, Amazon kindly provided a free replacement.  Deja vu ensued.  For a few extra dollars, Delta could use more robust zippers--they really should.

I realize the price being so low that I would not receive a top of the line bike cover which is fine.  I did expect to receive a cover which would fit my brand new average size mountain bike ~ it does not.  since it does not fit over both tires, the plastic snaps that cinch it tight do not come together to make a complete unit.  I have to use clothes pins in certain areas to seal the cover in enough area to make the cover at least somewhat useable.  My tires and rims are left exposed to the elements and thus are getting mud and moisture on them when it rains.  Even the picture to the right of this review shows the cover with ample room all over the bike ~ very misleading!
Very disappointed

This waterproof fanny pack is not waterproof. We tried it on two separate occasions, both times fully closing each seal, but water leaked through anyway, soaking the contents. When I tried to return the item, the seller refused to accept it, claiming that its own tests showed it was working properly. Despite what the company now says, the fact is that the item was defective. I see from the other reviews that this is not an isolated problem, and the fact that the merchant refuses to honor its return policy means that customers should be very wary of doing business with this company

We bought two fannypacks, one for ourself and one for our friends who were going with us on our trip.  We were doing  some shallow water snorkeling, no diving.  My husband wore our fanny pack which contained his wallet and our passports.  Our stuff got soaked!  Why our friends worked we and ours didn't is anybody's guess, possibly ours had a defective seal.  These fanny packs have a seal just like a food storage bag and I know some of them don't seal right!

My daughter got these at 6 years old and she loves them.  She learned how to move about on them although a year later she's still quite wobbly.  The shoes still look pretty new after a lot of use. My problem is that there really is no way for her to stop. No knob brake like normal skates have, so most of the time she's pretty out of control or walking like Frankenstein. Also, the button to pop the wheels in and out is very difficult for her to push on her own, so we have to dot it for her. It wasn't like that when I first bought it, though. We bought her normal skates for Christmas to replace these.

This gun is horrible. I bought this for my friend and let me tell you it was a waste of $$$. First off it is a 3/4 scale gun so it is very small and very light, if you were to drop it it would deffinitly shatter. Also the cocking system is terrible on the top there is a lever you have to pull and if pulled in the wrong spot it will snap off and then it would be useless. When we did end up shooting it the bbs wentd straight for about 5 or 10 ft then curve down, so unless you are going get within five ft of a person it is useless, even if you do get that close he wont even jump the fps is more like 270 not 370. Also the clip is an absolute pain to load first you pour all the bbs into a chamber, then you pull down a spring and shake it upsidedown fot the bbs to gome onto the front chambet then you have to release the spring and put the clip in the gun. After about 10-15 shots you have to take the clip out and repeat the process. Granted it holds 180 or so bbs you can only shoot about 15 at a time. Over all this gun STINKS. I bought it when it was originaly 100.00 but the list price was 10.00 so I thought it was going to be decent, but i was wrong. SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE!!!!!

I wanted a bike to ride around on unpaved trails on my few acres in the country.  This retro designed, one speed, steel framed, coaster braked, comfort  bike seemed to be the ideal choice.  When it arrived, I pulled out the tool box and set to work assembling it.  The first frustration was that the instructions for assembling this bike are NOT included in the manual (which seems to cover every bike but this one). How hard could it be to write up instructions (with tool specifications)for EACH model they manufacture?  A one page flyer could have done the trick. To further complicate  matters, some of the models in the manual are assembled using metric tools and others call for standard sizes.  

It turned out that I couldn't complete the assembly, because I couldn't find a tool to handle the quick release hardware for the seat attachment.  I had to take the bike to a bike shop to complete the assembly.  Even the bike shop had problems with this bike, because there is so little clearance between the fenders and the tires.  I watched while they had to bend the sides of the back fender out by hand, so that it wouldn't rub the tire.  

When I got the bike home, the first thing that I did was to adjust the seat to the correct height, and take it out for a ride.  Within 10 seconds the seat slipped all the way down.  The quick release handle can't hold the seat in place with the weight of a rider on it (I'm not that heavy).  Chrysler should have taken the retro design a step farther on this, and drilled holes in the seat stem for a rod insert to adjust the seat height.  

Rather than try to dis- assemble this and box it up to return it...I will check to see if I can drill the seat stem myself to get the seat secured at a ridable height.  Its too bad they couldn't come up with a workable design for such an essential part of the bike as the seat height adjustment!  The points I do give here are for the otherwise sturdy frame, and tires that will work well for unpaved trails...when I can finally ride this.

This thing simply does not work!
I bought this prodcut for my mountain bike and I cannot even believe someone manufactures a false stuff like this. 
It cannot even hold the weight of my bike and bends out to side and eventually my bike falls.
I tried to adjust the distance between the two archs to fit the tire width to see if I get better result but no luck.

I just got the sword and I liked it but I thought that it was a little small. Then the sword broke from its hilt on the third day that i had it!!!!! Now you might think that I was doing careless things to it but i just swung it a few times slowly in the air and i realized that the sword wan't on there very good. After that I was just swinging it slowly around the house and it just fell off.
    So don't buy the sword if you going to do ANYTHING but look at it

I bought this gloves so I wouldn't have to wrap my hands to protect my wrists everytime I went for a bag workout. One reviewer is clearly confused. They said that there was a metal bar in the glove to prevent fatigue in your hand. Turns out there is no metal bar in it, but instead it was plastic or something similar. Then when using these gloves on my 100 pound punching bag I wound up with blood blisters all over my knuckles. This has never happened to me before and I have been working out with punching bags for over 15 years. Yeah sure you might get some skin torn off from your hands rubbing on the inside of the leather everlast gloves the first couple weeks you use them but blood blisters on your knuckles after your knuckles are use to those kinds of blows for years. Another thing I noticed about these gloves is they wear out fast if you constantly use them on punching bags. They get to the point to where you feel like there is no padding in them. Gave these gloves 2 stars since I liked the idea of being able to wrap these gloves on and go to work. But they need to be greatly improved upon.

I used to have DDR for Xbox and when my Xbox broke on me, I decided not to spend the money on a new one. However, I missed my DDR workouts everyday so I bought this as a replacement. I should have spent the money on a new Xbox. This product is not worthy of having the name DDR on the box. Imagine a dance pad game for Atari. Then imagine it is the worst possible Atari game you have ever seen, and that would be a close description of this game. There are 50 computer generated "beeping" monphonic sounds that irritate more than energize you. The rythem and the timing is off on all the songs, and the dance pad is very poor quality. It wasn't even worth the cost of the shipping to have it delivered to my home. I wish I had sent it back without opening it. Now I'm stuck with a game that even the pawn shop will not take.

This thing is being advertised as Dance Dance Revolution.  It is NOT DDR.  It is just a cheap knock off not worth a penny.  My daughter plays a DDR at afterschool and loves it.  She received this for Christmas, tried it once and gave up within five minutes. She said, it says fifty songs but it plays just one.  Well, the 50 "songs" all sound the same.  They are not "radio" or "stereo" quality, rather just computer generated noise.  Totally awful.  Having tried it myself, I am very disappointed and don't blame my daughter for not giving it a second glance.  Total waste of money and total false advertising.  This company should be investigated.  Believe the poor reviews and skip this product!!!!

My husband bought me this for Christmas, and we were both disappointed.  The graphics are awful, some give me a headache.  The songs are awful--they all sound alike.  Its the kind of thing you can do on a cheap keyboard.  The pad loses any sort of sensitivity very quickly.  I've had it two weeks, and already I'm hitting the arrows but its registering a miss.  I gave it two stars because my kids (ages 6 and 2) love it, but then again, they don't know any better.  I am using it to get better at DDR, but then I will invest in a better pad and game.

Before buying DDR, I read everyone's reviews, and thought that after all of the bad reviews I might still like it.  This product really fools you, this is why:
~If you've seen regular DDR you know what the pad looks like, well the dance pad and the box looks normal...untill you turn it on!
~It says 50 Songs, right? Well, it's not really 50 different songs.  About 20-25 of these songs are a trick-they combine 2 songs and make it into one track.
~The graphics are horrible...a screen looks like pieces of moving clip art stationed around the middle of the screen where the arrows are.

I wouldn't reccommend buying this...at all

the pipe is too wide to let the two plactic disks run smoothly. I could barely assemble it together because it would not fit. maybe they sent me wrong disks. I do not know but i am very dissapointed with this purchase.
it does not work as well as i expected. also gofit web-page does not have the exact description of the item as it is indicated on the box that they send it packed it. waste of money...i would better buy it at the store and try it how it works

I just got the mat and went to unroll it but it is stuck together, expecially where the paisley patterns are so that when I unrolled it chinks of the mat came off. Very poor quality and I'm unsaitsfied. I would not recommend getting this mat.

I just found one of these while climbing the stairs down at the track today.  I brought it home and looked on the net for some info about it and found these reviews.  When I read that people are losing this thing all the time, I could believe it!  LOL
I'll enjoy it until it falls off and somebody else will inherit it.

I am not very happy with my new pedometer.  It falls off all the time, the face plate comes off and I have a very hard time making it stay back on.  The spring has now broke from the clip, so the pedometer won't even clip to my pants anymore.  I have to carry it in my pocket and it is too big for that.  I am disappointed with this purchase

I bought this pedometer when the ratings for it were 5 stars!  Now there are all kinds of bad reviews starting in 2007.  Too bad I bought it in December.  This is a piece of junk.  I thought I was ordering a mid-priced pedometer.  (It was $12 at that time).  I agree about it not staying on, and even though I followed the calibration instructions, the steps were never accurate.  I had an additional problem in that parts of the numbers were missing on the LCD most of the time.  So is a backwards three actually an eight, was that a one or a seven, is that 5000 or 6000?  I never knew.  The only time all the lines displayed making perfect numbers was when you cleared it to 0000.  I'll probably try a 'cheapy' from Walmart.  It will probably do better than this.

This pedometer is easy to use and pretty decent looking.  Those are the only good things I can say about it.  It simply does not stay on.  I, too, have had to use a safety pin to make sure I don't lose it.  Maybe I have a defective device, but this is anything but accurate.  I consistently walk a measured 5 mile route every day.  One day the steps will be 5800, the next day 12800, the next day 10300.  Which is accurate?  Are any of them?  I can't rely on it.  When testing the device for accuracy in walking 50 steps, it never got it right.  Most of the time it was over the 50 steps, 2 times it was way under the 50 steps.  I would not recommend this one

I am on something like my 5th pedometer and until recently, I didn't want to invest a lot in one.  I bought this because I thought it looked cool and was a great price.  It fell off constantly!  For a few days I would pin it to my pants but that was time comsuming and annoying, not to mention painful when the pin stuck me!  It is fairly accurate, but who cares if you are always worried about it popping off and falling to the floor?  I finally invested in an Omron that not only stays on, but has a security latch you can attach to your clothing in case it does come off it will not fall to the ground.  I also bought it on Amazon, but it was around $18.99.  It stores a week's worth of steps for you so you can track your progress.  I am in love with my new pedometer, I wish I would have invested in this one first

I received this toy as a gift for my 1-year old son. It was one of the most frustrating toys he's had. The handle requires too much strenght to press down, so he was not able to operate it alone. He could press it down only when standing up (using his body weight), but the size of the spinner made it very inconvinient to play this way: he had to lean and  crouch. The noise that the balls make is rather loud (in my consideration) and can irritate the adults after a while, too. Because my son was already walking, this static toy got very little attention. The positive features: it is made of sturdy plastic and the colors are nice and bright

These gloves are well made leather gloves with an iron bar for good grip but they're very light and offer no support for the wrist or hand. In addition, the padding is very thin. I wouldn't recomend them for heavy bag or working with a trainer. They're probably fine for the speed bag. 

If you're going to use these gloves, at the very least also get yourself a pair of hand wraps or, like me, you'll probably loose some skin from your knuckles.

For not very much more money, you can get gloves that offer significantly more protection

I was extremely disappointed when I received this product.  Contrary to the description, the handles are hard plastic - not "comfortable and soft" as it states on the product packaging and website.  Other than that it may be a decent product, but after only a few reps your hands will hurt and will have the design from the grips imprinted on your skin.  I've already printed the label to return to Amazon.

Beware the other review of this product, the individual posted the same review for all ab wheels sold on Amazon.  Not only is it not informative, there is a good chance they have never tried the product

I purchased these as a replacement for some Joe Weider shorts I have had for many years that have started to wear out.

I bought 3 pair of these shorts, worn 2 of them 1 time each, washed them, and they both came apart near the seam.  The seams themselves did not come apart, but the actual fabric itself split in two like a 'run' in panty hose.  The third pair is still in
the box and I have not worn it, but I figure that the same thing will happen with it as well.

Also, one of the pair had one leg about an inch longer then the other leg. The one leg also fit tighter and you could tell the cut was wrong.

Like I said, very poor craftsmanship and materials

When I received the shipment, I was disappointed as all three kickboards were different sizes. when I placed the order, no where it tells that different colors kickboards are different sizes. Otherwise, I would have ordered kickboards in 'Blue' color.  The yellow and Purple kickboards are too small for me and my wife.

I was going to give this product a "3" because the trays acutally quite nice.  Just as the previous reviewer, I love handing out chips in them.  

However, I re-read the name of the product, and I had to change my vote to a "1".  These chip trays are not stackable which is really frustrating, not only during game play but afterward when I'm trying to store them

I bought this band in two strengths. It is advertised as "99.998% free of soluble proteins and latex allergens" and powder free and it is neither. I used them and got a skin reaction to latex which I would not have if it was only .02 % latex.

Customer service was helpful when I called.

Ninety dollars for this is unbelievable.  For less than $15 (that is less than one sixth the advertised price) someone with NO skill could make an equivalent product from pine 4x4s and 1x12s in 30 minutes or less.  It may not be "cool", but it'll get the job done.  Are you more interested in getting fit or having cool, trendy, and frivolous toys?

Avoid this plastic albatross.  It will be destined for a garage sale near you within two years. Go to your local hardware store, spend half an hour and $20 (and maybe learn how to work with your hands a bit) and get what you need without supporting this craziness...or--just go for a walk for free.

Save your hard-earned money

This was a very disappointing product.  Amazon delivered it in great time, but Razor is very misleading about the quality of this product.  It is too flimsy to remain upright while grinding it.  It is frustrating to be told by the Razor customer service AFTER the purchase, that it should be bolted down to the ground or bolted to a piece of plywood.  There goes the portability of it!  VERY DISAPPOINTING!

These are the short benches not the long ones that advertise on Television. The cardio video is entirely too fast. I teach aerobics twice a day and it's way too fast for a beginner even an advanced learner couldn't keep up. Also, the music is really boring. I use the benches for my own individual exercises not with the dvd

The first time I did this video I was in pain for three days. Each time I exercised to this video it got easier, but I don't have fun. I have nowhere to put the "fanny lifter" steps that I didn't realize were coming with the dvd and my boyfriend uses them as a table. If I could do it over I wouldn't buy this product, however, you will get an excellent workout. If you have more room in your house or apartment for equipment and you like an intense workout then get this video. (There is a person doing an easier workout throughout the whole video.

I will never purchase an item from BabyRide again. This canopy is MISLEADING. It said it keeps out the sun and it is made of net. The sun came right through and blinded my baby. Not only that. It is not worth the price!! You could go to a fabric store and buy the same netting for $5. Also, when I went to return the item they charged me a RESTOCKING fee which I had never heard of!!! Bad item. I ordered the Rayshade by Kiddopotamus and LOVED IT... get this one instead!

I also bought this because it was the Consumer Reports "Best Buy," and I expected to get a lot of use out of it. The frame broke on my first (I weigh 175 and run about 30 miles per week) after about 1100 miles, and its replacement just died after only 350 miles. So far I've paid about a dollar a mile. I'll never buy from Schwinn again

Schwinn - Nautilus  ZERO QUALITY CONTROL

The railings on the Schwinn 820p did not line up with the screw holes on the frame by several inches!  It was impossible to assemble.

With any quality control at all, these measurements are checked on every item that leaves the factory.  Human error is then not a factor.  This is a defect that should never happen. Schwinn/Nautilus has zero quality control.  That is simply a fact of the most basic quality control standards.  

You are therefore definitely taking your chances with this or any other Schwinn or Nautilus product.  With zero quality control, no telling what else can prove to be wrong.

And though the warranty says "1 year on parts", the warranty then goes on to say that there will be a charge for the installation of any defective or replaced parts.  So what is the 1 year warranty on labor?  Nothing, obviously.

I wish I never had purchased this product, myself

Because you can't give negative stars, I'll give this product one star.  I bought this product instead of the AbLounge because it could actually support a plus sized weight.

I'm glad this product was cheap, because it was the worst exercise machine I ever bought.  Everytime I swing on it, I feel it creak and wobble. I feel like its going to break under me each time I use it.

It makes a better decoration then it does an exerciser.  I've been useing it for a few months, and all its done is make me feel akward.

Don't buy this product if your plus size.  If your not plus size, go get the 210 lbs weight limited Ab Lounger Jack Knife System thing.  If your are of plus size, order THE BEAN full body (I just did)

This product is not fit for use in any circumstance.

It Definately Looks Great - But thats it!

The product (can't call it a gun) Broke in the first 5 hours of use, NOT COMBAT, play use with reasonalby responsible youngsters.

I am Extremely Dissapointed with the quality of the product.

I wrote two letters to the seller/manufacturer rep and no repsonse yet. 
Not surprised.

My son decided to spent 20 extra dollars on his replacemnt purchase and it WAS WELL WORTH IT.   We did not repeat buy and won't.

Learn from our mistake

I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son's airsoft rifle as a Christmas gift. The screws were too short to attach it to his Kitty Kat ( a shortened M-4) airsoft rifle's weaver rail. Yes, I could go out and find screws the proper length, but I though I'd make Airsplat do their job. 

So, after several e-mails with the service department, they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size. Wrong. The diameter of the new screws is so big they won't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight. Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws. Take a pass on Airsplat. The sight seems ok for the price.

I wish I'd read the reviews for this piece of junk before buying it.  I had the same problem many other reviewers here had: after using it for about an hour a day for less than two weeks, the cable snapped, rendering it useless.  This is just a poor quality machine, plain and simple

I bought this stepper to use when I am on the road for work.  After 3 days, 10 min/day the "PLASTIC" wheel bent out of shape and allowed the guide wire to fall off.  I replaced the wire and began again.  It was to no avail because the shape of the wheel was now distorted the wire would not stay in place and eventually the metal wire snapped.  The company, Spartan, actually replaced the entire stepper but the same thing happened.  The unit is rated for a max load of 220 lbs.  I am below that weight but it still broke.  If Spartan is serious about this product then change the plastic wheel to steel, or rework the entire mechanism.  This design flaw is totally uncalled for and easily corrected.  The rest of the construction appears to be sturdy except for this crucial part.  Since this product was manufactured in China it is easy to see that the company placed more emphasis on cost than reliabilty.  STAY AWAY!  This product was made for extremely light people, not for people who are serious about getting in shape and staying there

Amazingly, I had the exact same problem as the other reviewers.  I had mine for about 4 weeks, used it maybe 4-5 times a week, when I started to hear "snap - snap - SNAP"  The cable on it broke for me as well.  

It's supposed to support up to 220 or 250 lbs or whatever it is.  I weigh 180.  I also called the company and told them what happened, and that I wanted a replacement.  I was told it was on "back order" and the cable would be sent out as soon as they get them in.  After calling back numerous times, they continued to give me the same story.  I have since returned this thing to the online store where I bought it since they were NICE ENOUGH to understand the situation, and wanted to make ammends.

I have yet to receive my replacement part. 

Spartan Sporting Goods should be investigated THOROUGHLY!!!

I wish the review written in January was posted before I bought this thing.  I bought this as a present and the exact thing happened.  The cable snapped after only 2 weeks of use.  The ad states it holds 250lbs, but when you get it...the item states 220, which she was still below that, but the cable snapped anyway....STAY AWAY FROM THIS ITEM...FAR FAR AWAY.

This was given to me as a gift. I used it almost every day for about 1 1/2 months then a cable on it broke.It never even worked that well to begin with. I e-mailed the company for a new cable since it was covered under the warranty. They told me they had to order it from China and had no idea when it would come. They gave no apologies, they could not have cared less. EIGHT months later after I had already gotten rid of the piece of junk they sent it to me!!!!! I used it for 1 month the whole year!! How lame

I bought a GustBuster umbrella several months ago, expecting that it'd be the last umbrella I ever needed. Wow, was that a bad decision. This "windproof" umbrella had two of the spokes break in a light wind (the weather report said the winds that day were only about 15 miles per hour). So I e-mailed the company because I remembered that it had a "lifetime guarantee." They told me that I'd have to ship it back to them (which is perfectly fine), but I'd also have to pay them $10 for their trouble. What kind of lifetime guarantee is that? For $10 or less I could buy another umbrella locally. Their product has proven that it's NOT superior and it DOESN'T live up to the claims they make for it.

Don't spend all this extra money on a GustBuster because you think it'll work better. It won't. Go out and buy a normal umbrella for 1/3 or 1/4 the price of a GustBuster -- you'll probably get the same amount of use out of the normal umbrella, and you won't be paying an outrageous price for something that doesn't work the way their marketing claims

I car camp around 6 weeks a year. Every night on a different spot. I was looking for a light and sturdy table. Easy to setup and easy to pack. This table is not the right table for me. Yes it's light. That's the only good atribute I can find for this table. It's cumbersome to setup. The plastic tabs that hold it together are very fragile. The end caps on the ribs of the top surface started falling off even before the table was assembled. It's low to the ground. I would not buy this table again, nor I would recommend anyone to buy it. I give it one star because I can't give it any lower.

The set-up was easy and the bikes were easy enough to load, but when used in a 2-in. hitch it wobbles like crazy!  I was a nervous wreck just driving across town watching our bikes sway 45 degrees on every right turn.  I had a neighbor who knows alot about bike racks look at it and he said it was assembled right, but it's just not that tight in a 2 inch hitch.

i did not pay head to the other reveiws, and bought this bike anyway.  the first day i had it, the back fender snapped off, leaving sharp points exposed.  sadly, we had to tell our 4 year old, on his birthday, that he could not ride the bike.  so we returned it and got another one.  not more than 30 mins after getting on the new one, than the "exhaust pipes" came off, leaving a VERY sharp screw exposed, then the tire came off and the rim broke, becuase it was plastic as well. also, the vinyl on the seat started to come apart.  

at this point, i had to return it, and fight to get my money back!!  it was a week after it had been delivered to the house.  i was to afraid that my kids would get hurt on this peice of junk.

please do not endanger your children by purchasing this bike!

I ordered this knowing that it would have its limitations, but I expected it to project sound at least a short distance. When we tried it out all we got was feedback. Words were not audible at all. When I contacted the seller I was told it was a novelty item only, which I think is a ridiculous answer, since even a novelty item should work a little... Maybe the one we got was broken. I didn't try again, since the seller didn't seem to think anything was wrong with it when I called, and the shipping, which was not refunded when I returned it, was just too expensive to have nothing to show for in the end

This item sounded great in the ad, but the only thing right in the ad is that it's pocket-sized. No one can understand what I say through it.  When the volume is turned up, the sound becomes fuzzy and incoherent. I thought this would be a great device, but no one can understand me 10 feet away, much less 200.  If you order this device, save the box it came in so you can send it back and get a refund.  WARNING: The shipping is non-refundable

This was a bitter disappointment.  One of the features we expected to get the most use from was the volume control.  However, if we raise the volume much more than a quarter of a setting, we get horrific feedback (screeching).  Nothing seems to help and when I sent a note to the manufacturer for advice, I never received an answer.  Unfortunately I'd already disposed of the packing info when we discovered the problem, so it looks like it'll hit the trash.  Save your money and don't purchase this item

This bench is a bit of a joke, unfortunately.  Having put the bench together myself, I can tell you the most flimsy part of the bench is the part you sit on:  It's particle board wrapped in thin vinyl sitting on two VERY small pieces of metal, balanced over the main structure.  I feel foolish for buying this bench.  

Between the shoddy construction and the fact that the bench is supposedly rated for a MAXIMUM TOTAL WEIGHT OF 300lbs -- INCLUDING YOU AND THE WEIGHT YOU'RE LIFTING, I think it would be a mistake to purchase this.  

The maximum width of this bench is only 3 feet.  It's narrow.  And small.

This bench went together quickly.  All the parts fit well and the instructions were decent.  Anyone with a simple set of tools and about a hour can handle it with no problems.  There are a few steps where a second set of hands help.  Craftsmenship of the parts themselves seems to be pretty decent.

However, this bench is simply not built for much weight.  It will wobble and flex.  It doesn't feel safe at all.  If you are serious about lifting you will quickly out grow the weight capacity of this bench.  

There are alot better benches out there for just a little more money

If you study Pilates then you will see how the performers do not have the proper body positions. One of the girls keeps staring at the camera for no reason and moving her body when it should be still.

As a lover of Pilates and how much it has done for me, I urge you to buy something else

Overall, the system is useable but there are multiple areas of potential improvement. The most important area for improvement is the height of the weight bench. It is too high so there is no way to perform a traditional bench press. Second, the pegs that hold the weight bar in place are positioned where one would normally place their hands. There is no way around this other than narrowing your grip. The fly bars are awkward and tend to bang against the bench support. The lateral pull bar provides resistance through some palstic housing which I am pretty sure will wear out in a short period of time. The weight bench has basically been relegated to my off day strength work outs since it does not provide the stability and support for a vigorous weight session.

This product is actually quite small.  Even though is says mini, I still expected it to be a little bit bigger.  Also, it will not stand up with a drink bottle in it.  The seams on the bottom make it too unstable to stand alone

The Ab Roller was a big disappointment for me. It was more difficult to assemble because of shoddily constructed parts. Then , once that project was done, I was unable to use it as the design is clearly for someone at least 4 or 5 inches taller than me. As a very petite(4'11")woman  my hands barely reached the top bar, making it impossible for me to get the leverage to use the machine properly. So beware shorties out there

Received the ab roller and the box contained none of the hardware necessary for assembly.  5 days after emailing the company, they reply that they are unable to send the hardware and I must return it to them before they will send out a new box.  Very frustrating- I must drive 20 miles to the nearest UPS store to return it.
Wish I had just bought the thing at Walmart

I bought this pump and used it on three bikes, a total of 5 tires before the foot pedal bent, then broke.  If you need a pump, I suggest going to a bike store and paying for a good one.  I tried to go the inexpensive route and learned my lesson.  Bell products are cheaply made and don't last beyond a few uses.  Don't make my mistake and disappoint your kids on a Sunday when there's nothing you can do about it except to drive to the nearest gas station for air.  Stay away from this, and other "pedestrian" pumps.  Makes you wonder what a Bell helmet will look like after a spill

It only runs for about 15 minutes with a child who weighs 50 lbs.  Doesn't run well over pine needles or leaves.  (Make sure to rake the yard before riding!) The acceleration in slow, the child pushes on the pedal and nothing happens.  I spent most of the 15 minutes run time push starting the thing.  It stops when the child tries to make a tight turn.  All of this was on the grass-it was advertised as being rugged off-road capable, when in fact it only works on the paved driveway.  Don't hold your breath waiting on hold for live customer service person...it's been 3 days and still haven't heard!

You can only ride for 45 minutes after charging the battery for 12 hours. Forget about buying an extra battery to charge while you ride, because of the adapter it only charges while its on  the machine. There is no seperate battery charger.

We bought this cargo bag for a 900 mile trip from Pennsylvania to Florida. We didn't use it on the way there, but on our way home, we put two medium sized suitcases in it.  We barely made it 100 miles before the bag started coming unglued at the seams.  Fortunately (or unfortunately due to the color), we had a bright yellow roll of duct tape with us, so we were able to repair the bag as we drove.  After another 100 miles, we had to stop again and repair the bag.  We drove from Florida to Hilton Head, having to stop three times to repair the bag with the bright yellow duct tape.  From Hilton Head to Pennsylvania, the bag started to look like a nightmare of black, criss-crossed with yellow.  The last leg of our trip was nothing but a hassle, having to stop to fix the bag.  

The company has a 30 day return policy, but we missed that by a day, having ordered it two weeks before our trip and being gone for two weeks, and they wouldn't even work with us on it.

I have had this stroller for ONE day and I'm going to send it back or sell it. I am so disappointed. I was so excited for this to arrive. We set it up...instructions were a little shady here and there, and I try and adjust the seat. I have the strap pulled ALL THE WAY BACK and my two year old looks like he is almost laying down. He HATES it. He is a very happy kid and loves to ride in his stroller. He was miserable because he couldn't sit up and look around, plus the tray was at such a weird angle in relation to the seat angle that he couldn't even see the Cheerios on the tray from his angle! His Playtex sippy couldn't fit into the small hole for a drink in the kids tray, and my water fell out over and over again from the parents tray. The construction is great, the fabrics are nice....overall I could have given it five stars, but the seat positioning is SO extreme that it makes my son start to cry....that makes it a really crummy purchase. If you are wondering about which one to buy, DO not buy this one unless your kid loves looking at the sky all through your walks

I was very dissastisfied with the product.   The 16 inch DORA bike was a christmas gift for my youngest daughter.  We had to keep it in the box until Christmas Eve, so that she wouldn't find it.  When I started assembling it that night, we found no training wheels or SEAT.  I was very upset for obvious reasons, how do you tell a 4 yr old that Santa forgot the SEAT and training wheels for her bike

These goggles suck.  I swim an hour a day every day and not only do they scratch if a fingernail touches them, but they fog up in 5 minutes, fit terribly, are hard to adjust, and cause irritation around my eyes.  They leak water  and the different nose pieces are just a joke.  They go from tiny, a little bigger than tiny, huge, and then extra huge.  They don't fit!  What a waste of $15.  I've had similar success from goggles one can find at the grocery store.  They are only  $5, and they fog up and leak the same as these.

I love the idea of this... sleek, out of the way for transit but 
readily available on the road, protected when not in use.  Unfortunately,
the reality is a hard to use product that does little to improve road safety.
Because of the narrowness of the mirror, it's very difficult to focus on what 
is actually behind you with a quick glance.  Sure, if you sit there for 10 
seconds you can figure it out, but I don't have that sort of time when I'm 
dodging through Chicago traffic!

Save your money and buy the excellent Mirrcycle instead

Mirrors are too small and too distorted.  The picture on the package shows a perfect reflection - as if!!  

It's about as useful as taping two foil-wrapped sticks of chewing gum to your handlebars and expecting to be able to see reflections in them

Be sure you have a very flat, smooth surface for these bumper cars. There is almost zero clearance between the driving surface and the bumper part of the car. Our girls rode them in our driveway/sidewalk and constantly got stuck on uneven surfaces or the edge of the driveway. We had to make the girls get out and pick up and move the car to a flat surface. These are probably much better for a basement or a perfectly flat surface like a tennis or basketball court.

I hate to complain too much since this is a pretty cheap item, but just to warn others - I bought this because I wanted an ab bench.  It really doesn't suit that purpose too well since it was one incline position only for abs - the other positions are just back support for working with dumbells.  The ab position is pretty weak and doesn't really work your abs as well as an abs only bench would have, plus it is a bit uncomfortable and as the other reviewer said, if you are anywhere near 6 ft tall or over, get something else.  Combined with shipping - this is a waste of almost 100 bucks here - while usable, it really won't make an impact on your workouts.  I did a few sets of situps and really don't feel the tightness I would have if I used a real bench or even just sat on the floor for that matter.  If you're on a budget, this may work if you put something under the front base to put it on a greater incline and/or do situps holding weights - and make sure you pad it with a blanket or something - the position is just too awkard.  The fact that it's a multipurpose bench takes away from it as an effective ab bench - real ab benches are ONE smooth incline, not a perpendicular seat that bends down halfway which really stretches your back a bit too much in a direction it's not supposed to bend LOL

From the previous reviews it seems that this product doesn't deliver any satisfaction at all. Buy instead the wrist roller manufactured by proboxinggear.I bought one eight months ago and I loved it. I use it at home and even at the gym, since it is small and very light, so it fits in my backpack taken about the same space than my gloves.

The one I bought is really an excellent accessory, since is not only a Wrist exerciser, but a complete Forearm Strengthener. Simple to use, with no spring or moving or breakable parts, it looks like it will resist the hardest workouts and continuous use.

With simple rolling movements and as you gradually increase resistance by adding weight plates to it you strengthen hands, wrist, forearms and upper arms. I have considerably improved wrist stability and holding power, and also feel an Increased range of motion and flexibilit

Both the original order and the attempted re-order were missing the same parts (the plate that holds the weights on the end of the rope and the nut that holds the plate on the bolt at the end of the rope) when the item arrived.  I think that this is a design flaw in the packaging

i bought this bike(in the mermaid ariel theme)for my 2 year old daughter. the manufactor's age for this bike is 1 1/2 year and up. this bike is awful. the seat is set up like it would be on a normal bike BUT, the pedals are attached to the FRONT wheel like a tricyle- which make it IMPOSSIBLE for a child to reach the pedals while sitting on the seat. my 4 year old son can reach the pedals but, he even has a hard time riding it. its truly a waste of money and if i could find the receipt, i would take it back! it was a huge disappointment-as a Christmas gift. Whoever designed this bike did not have a child in mind. there is no way a child could ride this bike comfortably even if they could reach the pedals

When I ordered the product, I kept putting on my order for a medium size. When the final paperwork was sent for delivery, it said it was being shipped and it was a small. A small was sent, instead of a med., therefore
we could not use the product. If you can take care of this matter, with a return ticket for the small one, we would appreciate it

Though I bought this boxing glove with a $20 discount, I still think it was overpriced.

First, I had a hard time getting my hand into the glove and I only have medium-sized hands.  I make do with taped hands but using this glove with the "popular" Evergel hand wraps is out of the question.  (Tape's better than the Evergels anyway.)

Second, on one of the gloves, the Everlast label on the elastic wrist wrap started coming off, though I'd only just started hitting a heavy bag.  It's made of this cheap plastic-like material.  (You'd think for $100, you'd get a glove with every detail of medium to high quality.)  I cutoff the hanging label entirely.

Third, the product description states five distinct layers of foam are in the glove between your hand and point of contact.  With the 10 oz glove, it doesn't feel like anything special, just a thin layer of foam.  I'm not impressed with the padding.

Overall, the glove is of medium to low quality.  It even looks cheap.  (The leather is less than a millimeter thick and the stitching is ordinary.)  I'll use the glove as I've already spent the money, but my next glove I think is going to be a Title Platinum.  Unfortunately, Everlast seems to have gone the way of cheap mass production and net profit at the sacrifice of it's reputation

I wanted to confirm that I had the same experience as the other dissatisfied reviewers. The Everlast Bar comes with nuts that don't fit the screws. The nuts are laced with a hard inner plastic lining that requires you to use powertools to force the screw to chisel through. I returned it for a new one, thinking that surely this was a mistake, but the replacement had the same pieces. Horrible!

However, I was determined to make my purchase work, so I put it together with force. Once I had everything assembled, I found that the bar does not keep together by design; even with the screws pretty secured, the outer loops on the bar (they are supposed to serve as multi-purpose handles) can unhinge and detach from the bar, because their connection to the bar on one side is not secured by screws. That's absolutely ridiculous when this is clearly supposed to be keep you safely suspended in mid-air.

Thoroughly dissatisfied. I've used the Door Gym and it's much more secure than this

First off. The knife is great. I wouldn't expect anything less from swiss army. only bad part about the knife is that the altimeter has an accuracy error margin of about 75%. And since this is both the title of the knife and the main feature of it, I give the knife a two. Only because you can get a knife just like it without the altimeter that works just as well.

This machine is too easy. Even with the additional resistance bands, it's just not enough if you're an active person at all. The assisted crunch funtion is a joke and most of the moves are just as effective without the machine. I used it every day for a month (until I felt I'd gotten my money's worth) & now it collects dust. I'd sell it for $20 at this point just to get it out of my house. I see my Easy Shaper becoming a Goodwill donation in the very near future

This gun sucks!
-it has the worst range out of all the ones I own. When I lob it, I can only shoot twenty feet.
-fps sucks. i can shoot my hand two inches from the barrel and it doesn't hurt.
-flimsy. no joke, I dropped it when I was playing, and it shattered.
-accuracy is a joke. I have a walled backyard, and I was at one end. When I lobbed it, I hit the the wall once (20 ft away.) I fired it again (twice) and I hit 5 and 7 ft away from my mark.
-The one "good" thing about this gun is the price. 3 dollars is not bad for this piece of dog feces

The set is fine, however the crate was completely busted up.  I will think twice before I order an item so heavy for it was not packed well at all.  I was going to try and get a refund, but I am not going to pay to have it returned.  However, if the "Powers that be" might receive this e-mail - a new crate or bag would be wonderful.

Plastic junk.  Tried it once.  Wont try again.  Just get a piece of rope and cut it to size.  This thing is suppose to be adjustable.  Only with difficulty of yanking it through the handle.  The plastic rope does not turn properly so therefore it twists and kinks, leading you to trip over it.  Just get a piece of rope

We bought and then returned the Scuttle Bug.  It was well made and easy to snap together.  However, it was far, far too small for our 27 months old daughter - who happens to be very petite (only 25 percentile for height and weight). Her knees dragged the ground.  I think it is a cool product, but maybe for younger/smaller children.  We wound up getting a kiddio trike which is fantastic!!

Make sure that your bike is compatible with this trailer.  It doesn't work with every bike, it didn't with mine.  I called Allegro Medical several times to try and return it and they gave me a hard time about it saying I cant return it unless it is defective.  So now I have a bike trailer and a bike that don't work together and I'm out $85.00.  Horrible

This bike trailer seemed like a great deal. When I assembled it and tested it out it worked great, seemed very safe and comfortable. My daughter loved riding in it. Initially I was very happy with the product, especially for the price paid. Unfortunately after several weeks in the sun all of the white nylon straps - used for support and restraints - began detoriating and breaking. I would recommend spending a little more on a bike trailer that uses a better grade of materials

Received the order in a timely fashion however, the box was badly I mean badly damaged . It was a birthday gift for a family member . I always order early , mistake , returns are 30 days . We had the party 45 days later when we opened the box rust went on the carpet did you ever try to get rust out of off- white carpeting . To make things even worse it was missing all the hardware for putting it together . Probably fell out of the hole in the box that was there before they shipped it to me . HAPPY BIRTHDAY !!!!!! and your welcome for the carpet stain , all new things come rusty , you didn't know that

I was attracted to the Park & Sun PB-PRO Pitchback Pro because of the large dimensions of the tubing and the hinge assembly that would allow me to easily fold the unit and place it in my garage. The first unit I recieved arrived with the box trashed and the netting, hing pieces, and hardware missing. I promptly recieved a replacement box and it contained everything I needed to assemble the unit. 
Unfortunately, the tolerance on the nipples and flanges of the tubing pieces varies considerably. After juggling pieces around and pushing and tugging, I ended up with two pieces that should have fit with other pieces but absolutely did not fit any of the pieces. On one vertical piece the nipple was too big and would not fit into any of the flanges; on a corner piece the recieving flange was too small to recieve any of the vertical pieces. Also, the tubing is made of rolled steel tubing, and the weld is not ground off of the interior of the tubing so that virtually all of the pieces are difficult to fit together. The packaging was insufficient as several pieces came with the paint rubbed off with rust showing through due to shifting of the contents. There was rust dust on the plastic sleves covering the tubing, particularly at the tube ends. Nice idea, poor execution.

This stand deserves a 0, but that wasnt an option. The engineers that designed it were smoking something wicked. It is of poor design and quality. I wouldnt take if they were givin it away. I've had it set up in my basement for a few days and I couldnt wait to take it down and return. Which I did. Pronto. Do yourself a favor. Stay away

This stand is very bad quality. Not worth investing in this stand. The speed bag platform isnt even made out of real wood. It vibrates too much! The Swivel it comes with is made out of plastic! It Sucks! Invest in a better stand like the ones from www.balazsboxing.co

I was thrilled when I received this knife. It was cute, small, and the utilities were perfect for light duty mom-emergency situations. However, after less than a month in my purse, the floral plastic cover (which in truth I thought felt pretty flimsy when I got it) had broken off one side and was cracked on the other. Sigh..

Don't buy this.  It doesn't work.  The ink is not even at all if and when you can get it on the stamp.  I've attempted around 50 stamps (on some range balls) and not one is crisp and clear.  The stamp is either running (too much ink), or the middle letter is messed up from too little ink.

Save your money, buy a sharpie pen and mark your balls with that

My son hit .515 as an 8 year old last year.  This year, he moved up a division and has struggled at around .250, even though he has a fairly nice swing.  Using this device for two weeks, he suddenly can't hit anything.  I pitched him hardballs today and he swung over the top of every one of the first 60!  The problem with this device is that the ball doesn't drop like a pitched ball, so it actually trains them to swing higher than normal.  I'll be putting this away for the season and trying to recover my son's swing and confidence.  Don't get me wrong, the kids love it.  The entire team lines up before every game and begs you to throw fastballs with it.  It's great for use around the house - just tie it to a tree and you can take swings that you couldn't otherwise.  Beware if you intend to use this for much more than casual practice and don't let it replace live pitching.  Fun-factor is a 5, but as far as a training device, I have to question its value

The design of the bed is awesome.  Unfortunately it would not hold air.  There were no visible flaws.  The instructions state that the bed will need additonal air after the bed is originally used.  The bed would not hold air at all.  (I only attempted to use it in the house and checked for possible problems there 1st)

I purchased another bed assuming that the 1st bed had a flaw and the second one did exactly the same thing.  I love the design but I am disappointed in the quality

This was a big waste of money. The first day of use, my two guest had to pump it back up about five times throughout the night.

I thought maybe it was because two people were on it. A couple of monthe later I had another guest sleep on it. He had to do the same thing. IHe ended up sleeping on the couch. He thought it was a mre comfortable sleep anyway.

Again, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!

I didn't think it was difficult to set up but it clearly isn't designed well.  The target that hangs inside the cage doesn't actually fit.   And..... the netting doesn't stop the balls.  How's that for a good product.  1 out of 5 balls rips right through the net.  

Buy anything else

I expected much better quality from Thule. As used according to the manufacturers recomendations, this bag did not even last one trip from New York to Chicago without it's interior lining cracking and completely flaking off. In addition, the back of the bag ripped creating two large holes in the fabric and the zipper attachments became loose and proceeded to pound at the roof of my car. The contents shifted continually during travel making for a loud noise that's not unlike a pouring rain hitting the top of the car. This becomes a terrible distraction while driving. All in all I had a very bad experience with this product and would not reccomend it. Opt for one of the solid constuction type carriers, they cost much more, but are worth every penny. In the end I thought I was saving money with this product but wound up having to purchase a Sears X-Cargo container to replace it for my return trip back.

Placed the order on 11/20, delivery was supposed to be by 12/9. On about 12/1 I contacted the company that Amazon said was the provider, Unbeatable Sale, Inc. to verify that they did have the order. Unbeatable said that it was an Amazon order, period, and gave me a number at Amazon to contact. Amazon said that Unbeatable had the bike on back order because they fill their direct orders first. 
Cancelled the order and found a similar bike for 20 dollars less at Walmart.

Before purchasing this watch, you should go to a store and take a look. This watch is HUGE. The temperature feature works fine until you wear the watch, then because of your body temp. you have no idea what the temp. is. The barometer feature is displayed in millibars, not something I am acquainted with. I could not get the compass feature to work correctly.
   It took approx. 3 weeks to be delivered ( free shipping ). I returned the "watch" and purchased a TIMEX, paid for shipping, and it was at my door in 4 days and works perfectly

Don't order this item or anything from Mercantilla Inc. The product was a different color than advertised, it was missing three important parts, without which you can't use the bench, and many of the other parts were damaged. I've never had this many problems from any of Amazon's sellers. This was supposed to be my Holiday present, but it turned out to be a real disappointment.

I used one powerglove for a month and it was sporadic at working and then quit entirely.  Amazon sent a free replacement.  It did the same thing.  I couldn't get it to turn on, then after 8 minutes or so if it did turn on I couldn't get it to turn off.  It needs major redesigning.  I like the concept and it was comfortable but that's about all.  Barbara Baxte

I had great hope for this item after reading reviews, but found that it didn't function as described, and that the three buttons that control it are so close together that my fingers were unable to press them individually...and I have tiny hands.  It's a great idea, but needs a re-design before I could use it.

I've been using this mat for a little over a month, for a 5 day-a-week practice. At first I was thrilled, but at the end of my 2nd class, I noticed it was looking a little rough where I placed my feet. It's continued to get worse and worse, 100s of little pieces of mat come off during practice, and scatter on the floor around me. Since I practice in a studio, it's particularly annoying. I practice with the "sticky" side down, and the jute side up. The jute side is the side that flakes. Practicing with the jute side down stops the flaking problem, but then the mat inchworms across the floor.

Basically, I ordered my racket on the 11 and got my racquet in 3 weeks! That was really long, especially because I upgraded my shippping. I dont' like this because the grip isn't really grippy (lol) and the strings make your hands hurt because they're kinda loose. The only thing I like about this is that it donates to breast cancer, but I really don't recommend this raquet. I bought an N-code right after I tried to use this 3 times. Very unsatisfied.

I went to Swiss gear website to check out the pole and see if they had any others.  This is the only pole they have which isn't saying much for the brand, but I found that the suggested retail is $4 lower to what Amazon is selling it for.  Just seems like the seller should always be lower or at least the same price.  Even though Amazon is jacking up the price its still really cheap.  Probably too cheap to be any good

I tried $50-$60 sets from Regent (who apparently also does Spalding), Franklin, and Sportcraft, and only got a usable set by combining parts from 2 sets (alternately, one should check out manufacturer part replacement policies in advance, including who pays Shipping costs).  Regent and Sportcraft had several handles with too few threads, inviting breakage. Franklin wood and threads were such that 1 mallet's threads stripped when tightening by hand, and 1 had poor threads because the wood narrowed and flattened.  Some Sportcraft end caps rolled under, and they claimed their 2 " balls were 3" (if they were rounding, why don't they round their 3 5/16" balls as well?).   Franklin's stakes had different tapers, and about 1/16" different diameters.  On the personal preference front, Sportscraft's handles are grooved, Franklin's balls are, and their wickets are narrow.  Regent's colors are dull

When one trips the safety key, one has to power the treadmill off then on to get the treadmill going again. This action looses all the time and distance information. The Keys Fitness, who manufactures Ironman and a bunch of others, help line confirmed that this is normal for their products. I see this as a safety problem because many people will bypass the safety key by not clipping it on their body

I was so happy to order this. It hasn't even been put together yet... in box for two weeks. They sent the wrong hardware with it. I emailed them 2 times and got no response. After twenty minutes of trying I finally got a human voice. She was nice and shipped the parts. They arrived today and guess what? The same wrong parts again. I can't get a response so I guess I will have to also go and purchase the stuff to put it together. At least I have a list from the owner's manual. Overall experience was a big fat bust

Don't buy this equipment unless you have two very strong people who are expert mechanics. Other exercise equipment comes partially assembled, this just has alot of odd pieces. 
Complaint: 1) No "how to assemble" video as other brand names include. 2) Instruction sketches are small and diagrams are vague. 3) It took hours of painstaking trial and error to assemble, and we ended up leaving one washer out because once assembled, it cannot be diassembled. If I had known what a giant project this would be to assemble , I would never have purchased it.  This is Tony Little product is not an assembly friendly exercise machine, which Body By Jake products usually are. How much more would it have cost them to put in a a "how to" assembly video? I'll never buy a Tony Little product again. 
That said, it's very simple to use. 
Since this is the heavy duty model, it's heavy to move, and it takes up alot of space. It's a type of exercise equipment that needs its own large space. If you have a small room, think twice about this model.

This sounds great in theory, being that you don't have to get under the car to drain the oil. Fantastic! But while this has still seemingly been made out to be a great thing for boats and cars, I don't quite agree. You still have to get under the car to change the oil filter, so I'd suggest saving $50 and taking the ten seconds to drain the oil from under the car, which is actually faster than using this device.

Poor workmanship. Padded handgrip area varied from 3.25 to 3.5" long. Most palms are wider than that. The cheap construction looks like it will fail within a short period of use.  Shipping them back would cost more than they're worth.

This mat may have a design flow, or perhaps it was rolled up before paint on the cute paisley pattern dried up. Layers were stuck together and it was hard to unroll. In the process, the paisly design ripped bits of the bottom side of the mat. I suppose it's still functional, but my brand new mat looks pretty awful

This is not a usable sword. This is for fans of the movie and to hang on the wall. There are very few swords that can be used, among these are Paul Chen's, Cold Steel's and the Last Legend stuff. Only buy this if you intend to put it on your wall because failure is not a possability it is guaranteed if you try to use this blade

Don't buy these cards. They are of very low quality. I bought 4 decks -- several cards in each deck where visibly marked. You will be better off paying a few dollars more for high-quality cards.

I woke up repeatedly in the night with more pain that the Plantars Faciitis was giving me for the following reasons: 
-The front part of the sock device is extremely narrow.  I don't have wide feet, but the pointy ends crowded by toes and caused cramps that I had to adjust for constantly.  Could never get used to it.

-The strap around the ankle was too stiff and chaffed.  Took forever to find the right tightness that didn't cause my feet to swell painfully in the night while not being so loose that it moved and chafed horribly.  

-Honestly, even wearing a hard plastic brace was easier for me to sleep with.

A simple strap that supported the arch and wrapped over the instep has been the most effective, along with faithfully wearing the arch supports during the day.

Don't waste your money

The Thule load bars that I actually received were only 50 inches long, and I needed the 58 inch load bars, so I really couldn't do anything with them.  It specifically said right in the title that they were the 58 inch bars, but they were not.  I even wrote amazon  back to try and right the situation, but no one contacted me, so I had to sell the bars on ebay and buy another pair that were the right length

On my third pair since I purchased these gloves from Amazon a few weeks ago. First pair had Velcro on the inside sewn into the seam. Very irritating, especially when holding heavy weights and having the rough Velcro dig into the palm of your hand. Medium size was smaller than advertised, shutting off the circulation to my fingers and the non slip pads on fingers were ripping off after 1 week of use! Harbinger customer service was very helpful, and sent me out a new, larger pair for free (had to return mine first). This pair shows up, and the gloves are two different colors! Blue and gray on one and blue and black on the other. Strike two for quality control! Waiting for a 3rd matching pair from Harbinger. Again, Harbinger customer service is excellent, but the quality control of these gloves is less than average

This fitness mat is thick and cushy, but I find myself having to make a lot of adjustments during my workout because it's about a foot too short. My biggest complaint is that the 'washable' cover (a major reason I selected this product) shrank to a completely unusable size when I washed it (in cold water, line dried). Now I'm left with just a piece of foam that is inconvenient to transport and somewhat uncomfortable

I was excited to purchase what I thought was a quality knife for a good price with good ergonomics, being a Ken Onion design.  What I bought was designed to sell and not to last.  The handle was textured on the sides, but the edges of the handle were far too smooth to be held safely, especially if they were to ever get a little wet.  The thumb studs have very sharp edges that will wear out pants quickly.  The spring-assist broke after two months of extremely mild, absolutely non-abusive use.
The $12.00 return shipping fee plus the cost to ship it to Emerson makes the true cost of the knife about $84.00...and what if the spring breaks again?  My advice is buy another brand.
P.S.  The only reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is the tanto blade and the fact that it can still be used as a quick-opening folder, absent the "blur."

I would not recommend this product unless you absolutely cannot afford to spend any more money. For around $60, you could get the "World Industries M.A.D. Balance Board" and get a much better looking and more durable product. Or you could spend around $80 and get a Bongo Board. If you really want the best and have the money for it, you could spend about $120 and get an Indo Board.

The Zoomboard that I received was green and blue. Unfortunately, it looks garish, but a child may like the look of this. In addition to the garish coloring scheme, the board has a rough sandy underside. This is good because it allows the board to better grip the rolling tube. However, after a couple weeks of using it (five days each week for 30 minute sessions with my 140 lbs. frame), the tube develops craters from the sand and wears down. Then again, if you wait it out, the sand eventually will slough off of the board itself and you won't have to worry about wearing down your rolling tube. But the gripping surface will be compromised.

 If you try using this on a hard floor and not carpeting, the rolling tube starts to move less fluidly than before. Make sure there are no grains, pebbles, or hard materials on the surface you are practicing on because they can easily ruin your rolling tube. This may be a failing of boards that use a wood rolling tube.

Overall, this board is fun, but not great quality. If you absolutely cannot afford $10 more to purchase a much better product, then buy this board and use it sparingly on a carpet to get a long life out of it.  If you can afford more, keep looking and check out the products that I mentioned above and get something that'll actually be worth your hard-earned money

I am surprised this bike has gotten good reviews; I am quite diappointed. I purchased this bike after looking at many mountain bikes and decided that this seemed to be a good buy. However, it turned out not to be so. First of all, the bike is really ugly with its white and brownish colors, though I suppose that's a personal issue.

As for performance, this bike is not worth its stated price of over $200, so don't think you are getting some great deal. The suspension leaves something to be desired and it seems to be shifting funny. I am not an expert on bikes, but I'm pretty sure shifting is supposed to be a little smoother than this.

Also, after about a week, I noticed a strange noise coming from the bike as I peddled. It's hard to explain... almost like something is out of place.

So again, the bike is not worth this price. Perhaps if it were being sold for around $100 it would be a decent deal

I received my Stamina Products Adjustable Hyperextension Bench on March 13th of '07 and was very disappointed. There was hardly any insulation whatsoever in the box and it looked like it was just thrown in the box. The product was scratched and parts were broken. 

Fortunately the bench works, but it looks like it is already a few years old with all the damage. The product seems to be of quality, it's just unfortunate that SPS doesn't understand how important that packaging is and if it is insufficient it makes the product look cheap

I have purchased this backpack (in black) in August and I haven't actually used it until December of '06. I was carrying around 40+ pounds in this pack hiking along the apalacian trail, and on the first day, this pack ripped. My left shoulder strap ripped off at the bottom, and I had to secure it with a square knot. The next day the right shoulder strap ripped in a different place, and I had to loop the adjustable strap around a seam on the belt.

Also, I have stepped on the waist belt numerous times without thinking about it, and the flimsy peice of plastic broke. It still held, but I had to check it twice every time. I tried to pick up the handle above the straps on my fourth day hiking, and the left side of it ripped partially. 

Another thing that happened was that I was trying to put the heavy items at the bottom of the bag while hiking, and when I came home, I noticed that the bottom of the bag had some holes in it from when I leaned against a rock or ground to catch my breath. The bottom of this bag is nothing but fabric. 

This pack is nothing but a glorified backpack, not meant to hold anything more than 25-30 pounds at the most. If you want a backpack that is dependable, buy something else. If you want something cheap for a day hike or something, I suppose this pack is for you, but I'd still say that this pack is not worth it.

It's not that bad of a product, considering how cheap it is. However I have three definite criticisms. One, it isn't very stable. When your doing dips, it's pretty wobbly. Two, the pull-up bar isn't far enough away from the crossbars, so if your body swings at all during your pull-ups, it's really easy to bash your shins on the lower crossbar. And three, the push up bars are totally usless. You can not do push ups on them with out hitting your head on the lower cross bar.

At first they kept the water out of my eyes and were
comfortable. But after 3 or 4 times they had some water
leakage. I use them for recreational swimming at the
YMCA. But am already looking for another swim goggle.

I hope you post this even though I gave them a poor rating.

These provide good protection in case of falls while inline skating.
However, I've had them less than a year and the material is starting to tear and fall apart.  I am not sure how long they will last. 
I purchased   these to replace a  similar set I had for 9 years, which were worn, but not falling apart.  Now I wish I had not thown the old ones away.

The product that was delivered was defective.  The harness system was manufactured with insufficient webbing.  I contacted LaFuma and was informed that this was a recurring problem.  They sent me a mailing label to return the product free of charge and will send me a replacement in mid-April when the new model comes out.  The manufacturer was responsive; however, I was out of pocket $13.00 for a shipping box that I purchased for the mailing.  In fairness, Amazon should reimburse me for this $13.00 expense.  I did not expect to receive a defective product

The ski rack is attached to the Thule bars by a plastic connector which must be spread almost to the breaking point to wrap around the bar. The old 724 had metal connectors. Making them plastic is insane. These connectors will break over time. Additionally, a thief could simple steal your skis by grabbing the rack and twisting it thereby breaking the plastic connectors.

It was flat after one night of sleeping.  We had to blow it up to capacity every night and would be sleeping on the ground by morning.  

Also, be aware that you need an AC outlet to pump it up ... it's NOT for camping

I loved it the first 2 months i had it.  With out notice the cable shredded.  I called and emailed and nobody at the company got back with me.  It seem that the inside of the wheel was rough and began tearing it.

The customer service is bad and so was the product

My husband bought this for me for Christmas after we both had looked at reviews and decided it was a great product. I used it for 5 months with no problems other than the squeaky sound everyone talks about. Then, without warning, the bolt securing the cable to the right pedal popped off. When my husband called the company, he was told that the parts (including the pedal and cable) were only guaranteed for 90 days, and the frame for 3 years. In other words, there was nothing they would do about it. When I called, they told me that they could replace the entire stepper free of charge, but I would have to pay shipping and handling. That was today, I'm still awaiting a call back from the supervisor about the s&h reimbursement. This gave me a great workout so I was disappointed to find out it was defective enough to break after 5 months of use by a 120 lb woman (and I only used it about 3x per week). I'm hoping that this was a fluke as only one other review in this set currently states the same problem... and I'm hoping the company has the decency to replace their defective product

I would have given this product one star, but I did get several months of use out of it before it literally melted down into a useless steaming pile of plastic.

After about two weeks of use, the Electronic Mini-Stepper started creaking and groaning like it could snap at any moment. As previous reviewers have noted, the thing actually starts smelling of burning oil/plastic/metal. After two months of use, the shocks on both pedals started leaking fluid. Good thing I had a nice thick plastic mat underneath it.

I owned and used the Electronic Mini-Stepper for all of four months, using it five days per week (20-25 minutes per day), before the cable secured around the pully-wheel snapped loose of its moorings. This probably occured because of the extra strain put on the cable due to decreased pressure in the defective, leaking shocks. I now own a twenty pound, forty dollar door stop.

There's no reason, other than ultra-cheap construction, that a 160 pound man should be able to destroy a piece of exercise equipment like this in four months. During this time, I used nothing but normal exercise practices: smooth, even, steady steps...nothing jarring. Buyer beware on this one

My first impression is that the unit is very rugged and nice looking.  Then I tried to use it.  I mostly bought it for the altimeter and thermometer.  In the first day of use I just ran out of patience and plan to return it.

Here's the problems I had with the Altitech2

1.	Most of the time the buttons work fine, but several times I pressed the mode button and the mode did not change.

2.	When setting Declination page 25 of the manual states that you can press SET/RESET/LIGHT to reverse the digits, but as soon as you press the SET/RESET/LIGHT button the unit ends the calibration mode.

3.	The temperature was stuck at 87.5 degrees for about an hour after purchase.  Finally after cycling through the mode buttons the temperature instantly dropped to 81.5 degrees.  I held the unit in front of the AC vent in the car until the car was cooled down to 70 degrees, I suspect the air coming out of the vent was actually cooler than 70 degrees.  The temperature display never budged from 81.5 degrees.

4.	I constructed a rudimentary chamber and placed the Altitech2 unit and a digital thermometer in the chamber.  The digital thermometer registered 78 degrees, the Altitech2 registered 81.4 degrees.  I blasted hot air in the chamber with a hair dryer.  The digital thermometer quickly rose to 116 degrees and I turned the heat off.  The Altitech2 stayed at exactly 81.4 degrees.  After removing from the chamber the Altitech2 slowly increased to 94 degrees, went down to 92.6 degrees and stayed there for a good 5 minutes.  Despite the room temperature being about 78 degrees.

5.	The compass will only stay on for 10 seconds, then the display turns off to conserve battery.  This never seems to be long enough to get a good fix while using in reference to a map.  When the display shuts down you need to press the start button again to turn on the display.  Since this button is recessed, you have to reposition your hand to press the button with your fingernail (I had to).  This moves the compass in relation to the map again and is very frustrating to have to constantly have to press the start button.  I'll stick with my 19th century compass for now.

This unit might be worth keeping for me if the Altimeter is reliable, but after all the other trouble I had I did not even mess with setting up the altimeter as I had lost confidence in the device.

The band that holds the foot came loose with the whole string after two minutes of light use, I didn't even had the chance to kick with it; I excepted better quality from Everlast; too bad
In addition, the bands that hold the chin are designed such that it is difficult to tighten this thing on your shin

I tried $50-$60 sets from Regent (who apparently also does Spalding), Franklin, and Sportcraft, and only got a usable set by combining parts from 2 sets (alternately, one should check out manufacturer part replacement policies in advance, including who pays Shipping costs).  Regent and Sportcraft had several handles with too few threads, inviting breakage. Franklin wood and threads were such that 1 mallet's threads stripped when tightening by hand, and 1 had poor threads because the wood narrowed and flattened.  Some Sportcraft end caps rolled under, and they claimed their 2 " balls were 3" (if they were rounding, why don't they round their 3 5/16" balls as well?).   Franklin's stakes had different tapers, and about 1/16" different diameters.  On the personal preference front, Sportscraft's handles are grooved, Franklin's balls are, and their wickets are narrow.  Regent's colors are dull.  Rated 1 Star because sets tend to be priced by the size of the equipment, and this is too expensive for mislabeled 2 " balls

I bought one of the Brookstone mini-exercise bikes when it was still priced at $99.00 (on February 1, 2007), based on two positive reviews that were posted at that time.  Initially, I was impressed by the prompt delivery of the product but immediately discovered the bike was not factory assembled correctly.  Instead of a left- and right-hand crank arm, my exercise bike has two right hand crank arms.  This may seem trivial until you realize that the cranks are suppose to be threaded in opposite directions to prevent the pedals from coming unscrewed during use.  

I contacted Brookstone Customer Service to request a replacement part (I needed two right-hand pedals) the evening I received the shipment.  I had to place follow-up calls each week for six weeks until finally receiving the replacement pedal.  When, at one point, I mentioned simply returning the exercise bike, the customer service rep. indicated that approval would be needed from higher up the food chain because--as I waited for the new part--I'd had the bike in my possession past the 30-day return policy!

With the new pedal finally in place, I immediately tried out the bike and was disappointed (though, unfortunately, not surprised) that the overall construction feels very flimsy under foot.  The mini-bike is quite noisy and so far, I've found no floor surface that keeps it reliably stable during use--either on a rug or on linoleum.  As a result, I have to back it up against a desk, file cabinet, or bookcase to use.

This product has been a huge disappointment and I would strongly encourage people interested in purchasing a small exercise bike to please not waste their money--even at the reduced price--on this product.

I was looking forward to the arrival of this bike so much, I thought it was going to be a great way to burn calories while doing just about anything. But when I tried it I discovered 2 things. First off your legs have to be at a 90 degree angle in order to pedal without it moving all over the place (which means you have to have an adjustable office chair or put phone books on a normal one). And when I finally get settled on it no matter how hard of a setting it's on it only burns about a calorie a minute. 

This bike might be great for arm workouts because it doesn't move as much on the table and it can offer a lot of resistance (though I only tried it for a few minutes) but definitely not for your legs

I ordered this product for more than what its new price is on December 21, 2006 as a Christmas present for my mother. It didn't arrive until January 9th, and it arrived damaged!  We sent it back for a refund.  On February 2nd, this low-rate item arrived at our doorstep again, AFTER I checked several times by phone to make sure that my order was marked as a RETURN and not an EXCHANGE.  We decided to set it up and see if this one was better.  STILL DAMAGED in another area. I have called The Sharper Image over ten times now over a span of 2 months. I know their customer service number by heart, and I even know their direct customer service number (without having to go through the machine) by heart (call 1-888-344-5555 instead of 1-800...). Their shipment is slow and their processing is painfully slow! They've given me 3 different order numbers without telling me, so I couldn't get accurate information about my order online.  Beware of dealing with this company.  If you can, go into a Sharper Image store somewhere, take the thing out of its box to examine it, and only then consider bringing this product into your house.  One good thing is that they do give you a full refund, tax included.  At least that's what they told me by phone today.  By the way, this should be called a Foldaway Strider, not Elliptical.  It absolutely does not have the elliptical wheel or power that other more functional elliptical machines do

I am a personal trainer and I was asked by a friend to check this "elliptical" strider out for them.  I was suspicious from the price thinking that it really couldn't be an elliptical machine but checked it out anyway.  
As I suspected, this is simply a glider similar to what was on infomercials years ago. Except for the Tony Little TV glider most of those 20 or more gliders that were on the market are all gone. There is a simple reason that true elliptical machines are so popular in health clubs and that there are NO gliders in health clubs. With ellipticals and treadmills users lift their legs with each stride which of course is more like the natural motion of walking and running.  This of course engages many more muscles than the gliding or swinging machines of the past. Also ellipticals have a flywheel to allow the user to add resistance while still keeping a smooth motion. 
I've read the other reviews of this machine and realize that certainly any movement is better compared to doing nothing.  But it is a question of time.  You could swing on one of these machines for hours and while it might be kind of fun for some people it will never come close to a true elliptical.  I'm not promoting any one brand and I have no ax to grind, except that it is somewhat annoying when companies like Sharper Image continue to intentionally mislead the public because they know it sells products. The reason elliptical machines are called "elliptical" is that the user's foot goes through an elliptical path.  Gliders just swing back and forth like a pendulum.  If you don't believe me ask any trainer or exercise physiologist.  This is misleading marketing and no doubt they know they are using that name to cash in on the popularity of the real ellipticals.  My advice to my friend was to save a little more money and get an elliptical.

At first I was very happy with this stroller. I love the big wheels, the front one which swivels. The cup holders are convenient for both parent and baby. And the adjustable handle is awesome because I'm short and I can push the stroller at a comfortable height. Also it maneuvers very easily up and down curbs, steers easily even with one hand everywhere from the mall, museum, park, or on city streets. 

One of the biggest drawbacks for me has been the reclining seat back. There is a drawstring that you must adjust. This requires two hands and can be difficult at times if the child is fussy or uncooperative. Despite this, I still loved the stroller until recently.

However, after only two months of use, my stroller will not lock. It has actually folded up on my son while pushing it. I now cannot even seem to lock it into the open position for use. I have not found any levers to snap in place to hold it open. And because the stroller folds outward, not inwards like an umbrella stroller, it actually pulls the childs body backwards when the locks give out. This is very dangerous. I am contacting the manufacturer about this defect

I have a small head and this was way too tight for me.  It pulled my hair and left me with a headache.  Plus it has a strong chemical smell that didn't go away after wearing in the pool. I tried it 3 times, thinking it might get better, but gave up and threw away. Spend a little more and get the fabric or silcon style instead

After unpacking and assembling the Ab Chair Deluxe, I noticed it was cheaply constructed with poor quality fastners and metal components even at the price point sold. The digital read out display lite up all 8's and blanked regagardless of the written direction input or new batteries. Every black end cap except two have fallen off due to poor fit. I still use it extensively because the principal of crunching and stretching the abdominals is very effective. Get a ab chair, just NOT this one

I wish I could write a review of this product, unfortunately I cannot because the vendor (Verdent) is dishonest. You see Amazon requires all outside vendors to ship all orders within two business days. Verdent Gifts thought they could just sidestep this little detail, not ship my order for 9 days and feed me a line of BS on top of that. Yes, I called the vendor and he told me quote " we are having a difficult time getting UPS to pick up our orders", what a crock unless you are't paying your UPS shipping bills.
Anyway, to make a long story short, Amazon did try to help and is refunding my money after they tried to get Verdent gifts to make the refund, Verdent refused, so Amazon is picking up the tab...and hopefully giving the boot to Verdent Gifts in the process. Avoid a headache and hassle, steer clear of these bums (Verdent Gifts) and thier dishonest practices

I bought the chair for my mother. She really wanted the chair so that she can start working out on it. She loved it. It looks very nice, the size is alot bigger than what I thought it would be, which is a good thing. The only problem I have is that every time she uses it, one of the screws comes out and the arm comes loose. She is very disappointed with that because she's afraid to use it now. I'm not sure what can be done to rectify this problem, but it something that needs to be taken care of. Aside from that, It took a very long time for the item to come in and I'm very upset with the fact that we had to wait so long to receive it, and now she can't really even use it!

Ab Lounge seems to be made of quality materials excluding sauna Belt(import junk). Direction manual is almost useless, does not tell where certain parts go or how they are to be used. You will need to look at TV commercials,and possibly take a trip to your sports store to get an idea how this thing goes together. Their web site is no help

I don't think I have ever run across a more overpriced, flimsy piece of camping gear; and for this very poorly engineered and built table to actually come from Coleman was rather a shock.  The first time I opened the box containing this table was while setting up the camp site.  Too late: the table was so delicate that the main parts that hold it together -- the leg anchors that support the equally flimsy and fragile aluminum cross pieces -- had been broken in the simple act of shipping.  I looked closer, and these main supports were made of some incredibly cheap, delicate plastic.  This thing wouldn't have lasted a day on a campsite, even if it had survived shipping!  (We placed the table in the campsite's trash dumper the next morning). Buy a lower cost table from another company -- no need to even go to a higher priced unit, since anything else would be better designed and constructed than this table.

Continuing their recent trend of crisp-looking cards with nice borders and wonderful sub and chase sets, Topps has done very well with their 2006 line-up of cards.  The basic card design doesn't stray too far from their tried-and-true formula of having complete MLB stats for each player and a brief insightful look at each player.  These insights include quotes from players, teammates, stats from a particular time in the player's career, nickname origins, etc.  This is one thing that always set Topps apart from the pack.  

The front design includes action shots of each player trimmed in a border that somewhat coincides with each team's colors.  The player's and team's name are trimmed in silver.  The back of the cards have the aforementioned stats and a nifty cartoon in the upper-right hand corner with another brief insight into the player featured on the card.

With the collapse of Fleer, MLB has begun working with Topps and Upper Deck in an attempt to draw collectors back to hobby of collecting and trading baseball cards according to Athlon Sports' Baseball Preview.  One aspect of this joint venture is the distinguishing rookie card logo found on all rookie cards this season.  It will be used to remove any doubt on collectors' part as to which card is the "authentic" rookie card of each player.  You'll find cards with that logo in this set from Topps.

Another fine addtion to this set is the Mantle/Bonds homerun cards.  With the scandal surrounding Bonds these days, his cards may not be worth hunting, but Mantle's cards are a wonderful find when you open a pack.  

Topps has also thrown in a few autographs and relics as usual, but the real doozies here will be the "autographs" of all-stars such as John Adams and Benjamin Franklin.  Topps has inserted cards in their set this season featuring the actual signatures of each of the signers of the Declaration of Independence.  I haven't been lucky enough to snag one of them yet, but the basic Declaration cards are a nice addition to the set.

With historic sigs and Mantle cards, Topps has proven that nothing is more American than baseball, Chevrolet and apple pie.

A nice set to get

I have been using a Polar s610 for some time.  When everything is working it is a wonderful device.  However, it is difficult to keep it running smoothly.  For example, when I upgrade to a new computer I go through hell getting the software to work again.  Polar customer service is useless.  Most recently I have been unable to upload data from the monitor to my PC via USB for months.  I do not believe I will be able cure the problem without PURCHASING new software +  the software dose NOT include the USB connection software.  That is sold seperately.  Polar will not provide replacement software unless you purchase it on CD.  The rest of the world will provide software and upgrades to registered users online.  

Bottom Line - the product is pretty good.  However in terms of user friendly Polar is a total failure.

Highhgear is supposed to be in the outdoor and active gear business, which one would assume involves some knowledge about how outdoor and active gear works.  

So what do they do with this item?  They sell it with a ferrous metal split ring on the compass -- so that the thing will never point to north correctly as long as that ring is attached to the compass.  (This leads to the problem noted by an earlier reviewer.)

I bought this model to replace a previous version (no clock) -- the battery had run down and there was no way to replace it.  Which brings up another point:  Why an alkaline battery instead of lithium.  Dumb.  But even more strange is that the earlier version had non-ferrous split rings and the compass worked fine -- so Highgear is not even maintaining the QC they had a year or two ago.

Also, at least one of the buttons on my sample is pretty dodgy.  S1 - by which you set time, date, etc. -- does not work well.  Sometims it ignores input, and other times it registers two hits with one press.

All together, this product is the result of very poor design and manufacturing specifications, and/or very poor quality control.  

Please don't expect to much functionality from this product

i cant say anything for the other things, but the compass does not work at all.  North is always changing and if you move it to see if north will remain the same, north does does not.    i was looking for a simple, compass keychain.  this is small and a keychain, but a compass that works it is not.

No where does Amazon say in their description, that this comes completely disassembled!  I have purchased other exercise equipment and you usually have to put on a handle bar or stabilizer.  So here it sits in it's box like a big paper weight in the middle of my floor.  Amazon is not paying for return shipping and I can not afford to spend half the amount of the purchase to return it.  Buy your big purchases from someone who has a unconditional paid return policy.  This may be a good machine, but I will never find out.

When the scope arrived, it came slightly cracked on the end you look through, which wasn't a good start. Then, when i looked through, there was no magnification, just small red crosshairs. If you are looking for a functioning scope, DO NOT BUY THIS SCOPE. But if ur looking to decorate your gun, then this looks pretty cool on it

 I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son's airsoft rifle as a Christmas gift. The screws were too short to attach it to his Kitty Kat ( a shortened M-4) airsoft rifle's weaver rail. Yes, I could go out and find screws the proper length, but I though I'd make Airsplat do their job. 

So, after several e-mails with the service department, they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size. Wrong. The diameter of the new screws is so big they won't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight. Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws. Take a pass on Airsplat. The sight seems ok for the price.

This product is ineffective. 

The snorkel gets stuck, either open so that water pours in while you're trying to breathe, or stuck shut so you cannot take a breath of air while under water. It's is very distressing when you're out in deep water snorkelling and the breathing tube fails to perform! I often take in mouthfuls of water, or worse; suck for a breath of air and get nothing! It is therefore useless, I stopped using the tube as it is more trouble than good.

I bought two sets, one for my partner and one for myself, and they both fail to perform. The mask on one set broke after 2 months (the metal pin became dislodged) and the tightening clips on the flippers frequently fall off while trying to tighten them to your feet. The bag's zippers rusted not long after use... given that most people snorkel in salt water, you think they would have considered rust proofing the metal. 

Overall the quality of these not-so-cheap kits are embarrassingly bad. We both felt awkward snorkeling with them, and sometimes I even felt they were hazardous. 

We tossed these products and bought Cressi brand gear. It has changed our underwater experience

I wanted a high quality yoga mat that was long in length because I am a tall person.  I thought I had picked the perfect mat when I ordered this one.  I didn't have a problem with the length (although it smelled that new plastic stench) but I did have a problem with the weight.  This mat is HEAVY!  I knew it would be HEAVY when I purchased it and being a person in somewhat good shape I didn't think I would mind it but I didn't realize that it would be cumbersome.  The last straw that made me want to return it was when I was in a yoga class; sweating and I began to slip on the mat.  If I am going to spend this amount of money on a yoga mat I don't want any problems.  To Amazon's credit I was able to return it and they paid for postage.  If I would have had to pay for the return postage myself it would have cost a lot because of how HEAVY it is but I would have paid it anyway (that should tell you how much I didn't like it).  I am now looking for a long mat but lighter and toxic free.  I want something that will be biodegradable.  The problem now is there are so many mats available (too many choices can be just as frustrating as too few).

I've been using this mat for a little over a month, for a 5 day-a-week practice. At first I was thrilled, but at the end of my 2nd class, I noticed it was looking a little rough where I placed my feet. It's continued to get worse and worse, 100s of little pieces of mat come off during practice, and scatter on the floor around me. Since I practice in a studio, it's particularly annoying. I practice with the "sticky" side down, and the jute side up. The jute side is the side that flakes. Practicing with the jute side down stops the flaking problem, but then the mat inchworms across the floor.

bought this machine, based on the reviews on Amazon. It was okay at first. I workout regularly with tapes, outdoors activities and started using the machine twice a week. By the 3rd week it started to make noises as if the wheel was rubbing against the plastic cover of the chain. We tried to see if we can fix it, but it didn't work. I can't use it anymore, mainly because the wheel is not rotating properly and rubber/plastic is rubbing against each other somewhere. You get what you paid for!!! Now I'm looking to invest in something more sturdy. If you exercise once every month this is the machine for you!

This was a horrible product, it was difficult to manuever and control. It did nothing but immediately cause my arms, shoulders and wrists to hurt. I felt absolutely nothing at all in the target area, my stomach. Not even a little. It was boring and pointless to bother.This machine was a waste of time to ship back and forth and I do not recomend it to anyone who wants to work their stomach muscles. Its a misleading product and very uncomfortable on the back also. It hurt my spine to bend in the way they said. I felt the machine digging into my spine. I was so focused on the pain and the pain in my arms I could not continue for more than 5 minutes at a time. Dont waste your time buying this product. Its expensive and not worth it.

This is another fly by night workout machine that looks great in the pictures and on videos but when you take it out of the box, you realize that it is poorly and cheaply constructed. I own a ton of excerise equipment and this is the only piece of equipment I have had to return...I have purchased so much on the internet this past year and have been very happy with all of my products. That is until I purchased this Ab-Doer which was a TOTAL waste of time and money. 

The tension on the arms of the unit is way too flimsy and loose...The foam around the arms is also very cheap foam in fact my daughter used it "once" and there was already a small chunk of foam that came off the unit...She does not even have long nails...The bars that connect the seat to the bottom of the unit stay in place ok when your on it, but they do not lock in the base when your not on it so if you pick-up the unit to move it, it collapses... 

What's really bad is the so called back massager that is located on the main area of the center stem. It does nothing but hurt your back and is worthless...Even adjusting the bar for different heights is a joke...It's a screw, not a quick disconnect... 

This is one of those products that make a ton of money by mass advertising but will quickly fad out fast unless there are MAJOR changes done to this unit...It's sad when you watch some of those excercise info-mercials that have all these people with great bodies that may be fooling you into believing that the products really work...

I couldn't find any reviews on these until now...I will never again buy a product without reading reviews from the customer themselves. We are the best source of honesty on the market...Save your money or just do some sit-ups and leg raises if you can...They work SOOOOO MUCH BETTER than this product !!! 

If you do some searching, you will see some of the BAD reviews about this product that are coming in...Based on Amazon's review rules, I cannot list where I read them from...

Have a Great day everyone !!!

I bought this stroller and attempted to use it but one of the wheels kept going flat every morning. I had to order another inner tube. Then on the third day of trying to use this stroller, the front wheel completely bent. What a piece of garbage. I only had one child in the stroller and the wheel was fastened correctly and all I was doing was trying to push the stroller up a small curb. The other thing I didn't like about this stroller is that there is nowhere to hang/put a diaper bag. I sent this stroller back and bought a MacLaren double stroller

This is my third heart rate monitor. I purchased this one because the battery died in my last HR watch. I thought I could replace the battery, but when I tried to replace it, I broke it. Oh well. . . 

Anyway, I purchased the Reebok Fitness HR Watch because it was on sale (50% off retail). I couldn't find any reviews on it so I "rolled the dice." 

With my two previous HR watches, it was pretty intuitive as to how to set and operate them without reading the instructions. With the Reebok HR watch, I had to read the instructions a couple of times. After a couple of training sessions, I began to feel comfortable on how to operate it and use its settings. 

There are a few PROS on the Reebok HR watch: 

(1) The chest heart rate strap will work with Precor cardio machines with heart rate monitors.

(2) The chest heart rate strap's battery is easily replaced. (I don't know about the watch.) 

(3) It has a lot of features that you'll find in higher priced HR watches. 

Now, the CONS: 

(1) The heart rate reading is much too small if you're near-sighted or need reading glasses. 

(2) The shape of the crystal cover causes a glare under certain indoor and outdoor lighting so it's difficult to read the small heart rate reading. 

In conclusion, because the heart rate reading is too small and there's a glare, I can't read the watch unless I slow down, steady my arm, and position my arm at a certain angle to deflect the glare. Because of this, I'm disappointed with this watch. 

If you've got good eyesight, you can add 1-star

The medicine ball was ordered for a gift and when it arrived, it was very scuffed up and scratched.  It also had a flat spot on it.  I returned it for a replacement, which I got, and it was in the same condition.  Also the packaging was tore as if it had been opened before.  I  would recommend buying in a store so you can look at it.  We also had the same experience above with the 6 lb. medicine ball and the same outcome.  Definitly not happy with it

I went to a sports store and all they carried were sportline pedometers.  I really didn't know which one to buy so I bought this one because it was more attractive than the bright yellow one and it was more expensive than the 340 so I thought it was better somehow.  Even though it says that it measures steps accurately on the packaging, it doesn't actually display it.  It only uses it to calculate the distance that you've walked.  I was very annoyed by this because the 340 does track and display the number of steps walked.  I got over it but the thing keeps resetting in my pocket.  I'm just going to buy another pedometer.  One that displays the steps walked and has a cover

The idea behind this propane stove and grill is fantastic. You have a regular burner, and a small grill at the same time. The execution, however, leaves a lot to be desired.

Fit and finish in this product are extremely poor. Out of the box, paint was flaking, and various pieces required adjustments with pliers just to make them fit. The igniter mechanism on my unit worked very well for the grill part but very badly for the burner part.

The grill plate is aluminum with some kind of coating that already had scratches when I received the unit.

Reading other reviews I can't help but wonder if there are two different grills sold under the same stock keeping unit number: the bad kind and the good kind. If so unfortunately mine is of the bad variety.

I had a lot of fun with this stove while it lasted but it did not last long -- about six months! I live on a sailboat and I used it every day; maybe someone who goes camping once a year will have a better experience. The burner did not simmer well (the flame kept creeping back up) but the grill worked great until the stove itself died. It seems to have a design flaw -- the regulator has an unusually narrow diameter tube and the propane tubes inside the stove are flimsy and wobbly. I called Century and they said this is the way the stove is supposed to be. Hmmmm. I did not think it would last long but I liked it so much that when it died I tried out another one. This one was immediately defective and I took it back. Neither Century nor Coleman seems to make a tough propane stove any more. Camp Chef may be a better, though much more expensive, choice for a person who does a lot of camping

It is unfortunate to have to write such a review, but the product received was so beyond unacceptable that I am compelled to do so. The unit was received new, but the hinges were already rusted, the closure hasp broken (poorly designed and executed), the grille had sloppily attached and bent locating pins and virtually all the lid edges were razor sharp. Made in China, this stove demonstrates no attention to detail, quality control or materials.  I own several other brands of camping stoves and am dismayed that this unit was ever allowed out of the factory, much less, off the design table.  Further, the design of the unit is poor and execution is extremely poor, if not downright unacceptable (in major ways).  As this unit was new in the box, I can only assume that it represents the low level of quality and lack of respect the US manufacturer has for customers. Save yourself cut hands and returns, buy another brand

Beware!!! These balls are extremely hard.  They are like hitting bricks.  I bought them because of the name, Penn. I bought a new ball machine and bought two buckets of Penn pressureless balls.  After 30 minutes of play they broke my racket, my hand hurt and my arm hurt.  I am now trying to return these bricks, I mean balls to SwingSomeWhere.  I'll let you know how it goes

The medicine ball was ordered for a gift and when it arrived, it was very scuffed up and scratched.  It also had a flat spot on it.  I returned it for a replacement, which I got, and it was in the same condition.  Also the packaging was tore as if it had been opened before.  I  would recommend buying in a store so you can look at it.  We also had the same experience above with the 6 lb. medicine ball and the same outcome.  Definitly not happy with it

... and buy a GPS instead. I agree with previous reviewer (Dave57), I WOULD NEVER BUY A SUUNTO AGAIN. Worst than Dave, I simply got caught in heavy rain during a hike and my Vector was full of water, couldn't even tell the time. I send it to Suunto Finland for repair and they say that it leaked from the housing and "kindly" offered a repair for 140 Euros.

I had a Suunto for 10 months. The face scratched VERY easily which was disappointing. However the worst thing is after swimming in a pool that I could stand up in the watch FILLED with water and died. On returning to Suunto they refused to fix it under warrantee because swimming is not covered ! They say the forces created by swimming are to much for this watch and it was never designed for this purpose, despite the sales literature saying it is water proof to 100m. I WOULD NEVER BUY ANOTHER SUUNTO PRODUCT. Whatsmore the shop I bought it from say they have lots returned for the same reason and non of them were fixed under warranty either. It is also very difficult to use and you cannot hear the alarm at all

I bought this for my 8 year old to practice hitting. Although well built, it is poorly designed. The place where the Hit a Way attaches is not logical and causes interference with the legs. The cables on the Hit a Way are so stiff that the ball loses velocity quickly and does not wrap and come back around for the 2nd hit. You might get one or two hits in before it is unusable. A GIANT waste of money. The only reason I give it 2 stars is the construction is solid

I recently purchased a Bean round zafu and I find it didnt live up to the claims in the least.

This zafu came shipped to me with over a pound less filling than advertised (wich wouldnt matter if the cover wasnt made so big to hold much more hulls than it came with). First thing I thought after pulling this cushion out of the box was; this thing seems nothing like the pictures. It's saggy and about half the height of all the images I've seen of it. Not to mention once you sit on it you feel all the hulls displace to give you only about 2 inches or less of lift (I weigh about 160 pounds so I dont think that weight is the problem). I'm very dissapointed in this product.

The reason I bought this was not only for the reasonable price but I thought Bean seemed like a quality company. I payed $40 for this wich does seem reasonable. It does "SEEM" reasonable. That is till you tack on the extra 11 or 12 bucks for a pound of organic hulls to fill it to the level it was advertised at.

I bought this Product from The Comfort Store. Their probably the only internet company; along with Bean of course, I will never buy from again. Unless I learn more forgiveness meditating on my rolled up towel waiting for my extra hulls

I was thrilled to find that a reasonably priced rechargeable bike light exists. I avoid throw away battery items like some avoid taxes. We have too much toxic stuff in our landfills already an I refuse to add to the this insanity. However, to my great disappointment, the internal workings of the light seem to burn out before ever recharging properly and before the the green light goes on to indicate a full charge. Then the light ceases to function at all. Amazon was great in sending a replacement TWO times, yet the same problem persisted. I checked with BELL too to make sure I wasn't doing something wrong and I wasn't. This light is a great idea, albeit with some definate glitches that need to be worked out by Bell. The two stars are for the great idea

Really, folks, spend the money on a gym membership, go outside and play with your dog, play soccer with your kids, or spend time in the afternoons working in the yard or the house after warming up with slow movements and a power walk.  Be reasonable.  Just remain aware of how your body feels, know your limits (i.e. knees, back, elbows) and don't over do it!  It takes time to find your own approach to weight/figure management.  You can do it your own way.  You don't need this thing AT ALL.    

This product will NOT bring you any satisfaction.  you'll only feel stupid for getting sucked into the infomercial and wasting time when you could've been watching Saturday morning cartoons!!!

In the infomercial it shows you "all the machines" you have to use at the gym.  Well, there's a reason people use them- becuase their tried and true.  Those machines, well worth the cost of a membership, guide the user in producing precision movements.  THey cost thousands of dollars and are built to be absolutely sturdy.  You're better off using machines at the gym(hey, don't forget the YMCA), varying your cardio between outdoor and indoor exercise, and throwing in consistant measures of Pilates and Yoga, if you want to "change your body."

This is just another stupid product, we've seen them come and go for years.  It won't be around long, folks...

Disappoint will occur, and the probabilty that injury will occur is well within the realm of possibility.

The Sportline 353 Talking Pedometer works ok as a pedometer and as an FM radio, but it has 2 issues.

The Good: The talking part of this pedometer can be turned off or on. It is nice to hear when you are rolling along, "9000 steps." The FM radio is very elementary, but functional. There is no dial to tune. You push a button and it rolls to the next station. There is a volume control on the earphones. The pedometer uses AAA batteries that can be purchased anywhere.  

The Bad: The pedometer was constantly slipping off my waistband and bouncing on the floor. It didn't break, but it was very annoying. Several times it popped off w/o me knowing and I left it in a restaurant or in a friend's car. 

The Ugly: If I accidentally bumped the reset button  - on the kitchen counter or on the arm of a chair - the pedometer lost the day's count and went back to zero. The pedometer does not have a memory feature - so the tally is lost. This would sometimes happen 2-3 times a day. Very frustrating. 

The clip broke after about 3 months -- so I retired it. 

I bought a Omron HJ112 Premium Pedometer and have been very pleased with it. It has a teather so if the clip slips off my waistband, the pedometer dangles -- it does not bounce on the floor. It has a 7-day memory feature and automatically resets at midnight. It has a clock. It uses a button battery. It does not have a radio and it doesn't talk, but it works and works well. 

The Sportline would be good if it had a teather, a clip that didn't break so easily, and a reset button that could not be pushed accidentally.

I emailed Skycaddie "contact us" the day after I bought a SG4 to ask for help. 

I have received no response in 3 weeks.

I played today with it for the first time. 

A guy I was playing with today also had a SG4. 

Neither of us could get a distance reading despite the indicator saying we had a strong GPS signal. 

All we got was "999" or complete blanks.

He has played with it four times and said it worked ok twice and didn't work twice.

It looks GREAT on TV. It is a real pity that my unit didn't work today.

I plan on returning it this week

I have had two of these units (SG2 and an SG4) and all I can say is "don't believe the hype".  While the units are an unbelievable concept on TV and work (NOTE: WHEN THEY WORK) great, the lack of computer knowledge and the unbelievably awful customer service provided by Skygolf is, by itself, sufficient reason to choose another product in this arena.

Just to relay my experience (and keep in mind I have 15 years in the high technology industry to leverage open when attempting to set-up these units), it took almost six hours on the phone to set-up my original SG2 and even then it was constantly destabilizing my system software (ie-endless restarts).

When the SG2 was stolen at an event, I purchased an SG4 to obtain the next generation of the product.  Since the January 2, 2007, purchase date, I have been on the phone with no less than eight customer service representatives for a total amount of time approaching ten hours (including one Saturday morning, prior to a Sunday event, when they requested I attend a conference call regarding my unit at 5AM (NO, that is not a typing error on my part!) California time).  I have purchased/received (Skygolf sent me one unit from their headquarters out of desperation) and returned three SG4s at various points in the process to ensure that the units were not damaged.  I have attempted to download the software and access the website via the SG4 on five different computers and EVERY SINGLE SERVICE PACK OF MICROSOFT WINDOWS 2000.  Even after I forwarded Skygolf the computer log to show them the problem (software error) neither the software developers nor the customer service department could figure out what was wrong and the units were never operational.

At this point, all I can say is what a complete and utter waste of time this process has been and how frustrating (to echo another review) it is to deal with the people behind the product.

No product, no matter how fabulous in concept, is worth this level of incompetence during set-up and operation.

Good luck to you if you purchase the product.  I hope your experience is better than mine.

All this air pump does is let out what little air may be in your tyres.  I can't think of anything else I have ever bought that was as completely useless as this. It is a toy, pretending to be an air pump.  The nonfunctional lever on the top (mentioned by other reviewers) indicates that it was designed as a toy.  I'm just happy I was trying to put air in my tyres in the driveway, not out on a trail.  In the past, I have bought a number of Bell products, including motorcycle helmets.  I now shudder to think what might have happened if I had put one of them to the test

IT is amazing to me how something like this could even be approved for the market - This pump is 100% JUNK.  SO Bad, that I am finding my self actually writing a review about a bicycle pump.  The instructions were a disaster.... and why would I need to look at instructions for a pump? - Well, that is because it does not work, and I mean does not work at all!  The lever on the side is a total gimmick (does nothing as the previous review states).  Save your money here - Do NOT buy this pump.

I carried this pump on my bike because is small, light and looks good.  But when I had a flat the pump was usless and left me stranded on the highway. This is one of several Bell products I've been dissatisfied with

I got this because it was cheap, but since it doesn't work and I have to get another, I didn't really save any money.  The lever on top that looks like the lever on other hand pumps actually does nothing.  It's completely fake: nothing inside moves when you move it, and it certainly does not help grab on to the valve. It's just something you can play with while you're waiting for someone with a decent pump to come help you.  I did just manage to get air into a fully inflated tire.  With a flat tire, I couldn't keep a solid enough contact with the valve to get air in.

During the time I was considering buying this model, I happen to see the same thing at a local department store; so I bought it. I couldn't wait to take it back.
I wasn't impressed with the cheap plastic. The pump came with the adapter pre set for a Schrader valve; my tires are Presta. The blister pack says it can be used for both and indicates all one has to do is to take off the "round end", remove and reverse the plastic adapter, re insert and then screw on the cap [tight as per the label]. Seemed simple enough, so, I took off the cap, took out the plastic insert [I noticed it is in 2 parts], reversed and re inserted and then replaced the cap. When I put the end on the Presta valve and then pressed down on the "thumb part", I couldn't help but notice that the plastic would not grab the valve, but was loose. So I decided to change back to the Schrader type [and use my adapter valve]; maybe this would be a tighter fit. So, I took off the cap, and tried to remove the insert, but only one part of it came out; the parts separated; I could not remove the "bottom" half. I was not going to force it out. I put the parts back together, re inserted them into the blister pack and returned it. No thanks !!!
I gave this product 1 star only because of the way this review process is set up; it doesn't deserve any star or any consideration for purchase

Scary looking but inpractical.  The wooden handle it too thick unless you already have extra large hands already (if your fists are that big you don't need claws).  The talon shaped blades are sharp but can't dig in, they can only scratch.  They even have a hard time cutting through multiple layers of cardboard.  Nice wall decor but nothing more

Two Amazon's statements about this product were absolutely misleading:

1. "Usually ships in 24 hours". It actually took 1 week to ship it.

2. When I finally received the package it turned out that the watch didn't have "leather band". The band was made of artificial materials (nylon and rubber) or something like that.

I will have to return it

I have had two of these units (SG2 and an SG4) and all I can say is "don't believe the hype".  While the units are an unbelievable concept on TV and work (NOTE: WHEN THEY WORK) great, the lack of computer knowledge and the unbelievably awful customer service provided by Skygolf is, by itself, sufficient reason to choose another product in this arena.

Just to relay my experience (and keep in mind I have 15 years in the high technology industry to leverage open when attempting to set-up these units), it took almost six hours on the phone to set-up my original SG2 and even then it was constantly destabilizing my system software (ie-endless restarts).

When the SG2 was stolen at an event, I purchased an SG4 to obtain the next generation of the product.  Since the January 2, 2007, purchase date, I have been on the phone with no less than eight customer service representatives for a total amount of time approaching ten hours (including one Saturday morning, prior to a Sunday event, when they requested I attend a conference call regarding my unit at 5AM (NO, that is not a typing error on my part!) California time).  I have purchased/received (Skygolf sent me one unit from their headquarters out of desperation) and returned three SG4s at various points in the process to ensure that the units were not damaged.  I have attempted to download the software and access the website via the SG4 on five different computers and EVERY SINGLE SERVICE PACK OF MICROSOFT WINDOWS 2000.  Even after I forwarded Skygolf the computer log to show them the problem (software error) neither the software developers nor the customer service department could figure out what was wrong and the units were never operational.

At this point, all I can say is what a complete and utter waste of time this process has been and how frustrating (to echo another review) it is to deal with the people behind the product.

No product, no matter how fabulous in concept, is worth this level of incompetence during set-up and operation.

Good luck to you if you purchase the product.  I hope your experience is better than mine.

It's not very accurate because the sleep function sometimes takes some time to wake up.  But what was worse was that after I owned it for two weeks, the thing stopped working!  It was never dropped or damaged in anyway, it just stopped.  The display just faded away and wouldn't work again even with a new battery.  This one was such a waste of money, I'll definately buy a different brand next time

I have used pedometers for a few years. I was initially impressed with this pedometer BUT then I discovered the 360 I received did not always 'wake' and keep track of steps. The 360 I received did not always count steps even when already 'awake.' The 'sleep' 'wake' feature is bogus, it does not work and it makes this pedometer a loser. I would not be surprised if other users of this pedometer have simply overlooked the fact that their steps might not be getting counted because the pedometer is stuck in sleep. Heartrate Monitors, the company I bought it from was not responsive when I asked for guidance. I bought another pedometer from a different dealer, the Sportline 345 - It's my second 345, need I say more

I walk pretty much the same distance daily, and this device gave me wildly different readings for the same route. I could see being off by even 100 steps for variations in stride, etc. But off by thousands of steps? Hardly worth it

Initially a very good buy, however after only 3 days of very light use I had an internal piston head on one of the guns break while the gun was resting on a desk.... and I was in another room.  For the look and price its a good buy but you get what you pay for in this case

Im new to airsoft and wanted a couple pistols to screw around with friends with, and found these.  i probably just expected too much out of them, being about $8 a gun you shouldnt expect too much.  Well, me and a friend began shooting at each other, and the BBs curved largely to the left.  Not just a little, but one of them made a near diagonal line to the left.  They're really light (although expected with cheap guns) and have a really clumsy feel.  They at least look kind of neat, and the plastic orange tip is mainly hidden by that attached compensator (looks only).  I later bought a $30 gun at meijer and it shoots nearly twice as far, and shoots straight.  These are just useful if you have too many people and not enough guns.  Dont expect to win with these, unless you're fighting other people with the same thing.  And on another note, my friend pushed down the magazine release and it snapped off.  He wasnt pressing hard, it was just weak defective plastic.

**********UPDATE - THE OLD REVIEW (see below) WAS FOR DIXIEKIP.  THE ONLY REASON IT'S STILL TWO STARS IS BECAUSE I CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO CHANGE IT. OLD VEGAS CHIPS HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT HELPFUL IN THIS MATTER EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T ACTUALLY ORDER THE CARDS FROM THEM.  I WOULD ORDER FROM THEM ANY DAY OF THE WEEK NOW JUST BASED ON THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IN AN ISSUE THAT WASN'T EVEN THEIRS.   MY APOLOGIES TO OLD VEGAS CHIPS IN THIS MATTER.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM AND IF ANYONE KNOWS HOW TO CHANGE THE STARS, PLEASE LET ME KNOW. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THESE CARDS, GO WITH OLD VEGAS CHIPS, NOT SOME OTHER DEALER!!!! - JIM ******************

I ordered these particular plastic cards because in my opinion, they are much cooler than the paisley ones that are also offered.  I immediately ordered them, yet when my package arrived yesterday (in a timely manner, I will give them that) I opened to find the ugly paisley cards looking me in the face.  I have not yet contacted the seller to see what options I have, but this is going to leave me either two options, 1) return them and wait longer for them or 2)suck it up and get stuck with the ugly cards.  I will repost once I have spoken to them

The medicine ball was ordered for a gift and when it arrived, it was very scuffed up and scratched.  It also had a flat spot on it.  I returned it for a replacement, which I got, and it was in the same condition.  Also the packaging was tore as if it had been opened before.  I  would recommend buying in a store so you can look at it.  We also had the same experience above with the 6 lb. medicine ball and the same outcome.  Definitly not happy with it

The gloves looked great online but in actually, the quality of the product was not what I imagined.  The gloves lacked padding on the inner hand and palm.  Instead, it had a thin sheet of nylon.  The closure was not secure enough so I was able to slip my hand out even with it fastened on.  On the bright side, the gloves were pretty and I had no problems returning the product back to Amazon.com

The leather/pleather outting of the glove is soo thin that if you plan on doing any sparring plan on it tearing.  I used them once and tearing occured during padwork and sparring.  I would recomend getting a glove with a thick leather so you know that it will last through the beatings

I am quite dissatisfied with the quality of the new Leatherman tools.  I purchased two Leatherman Squirt S4's and the Leatherman Micra from Amazon recently and was surprised to see that all of them arrived scratched up(like it was used before).  Some scratches were wide and deep enough to cause cuts on your hands when you use the tool.  I purchased the Leatherman Charge XTi from another vendor, which was also not of high quality that Leatherman was once known for.  I have owned the original Leatherman Wave since it first came out and have had no problems with it.  It seems like the newer models are being mass produced without some type of quality control.  Or maybe someone is repackaging used Leatherman tools and selling them as new...
I will not be buying anymore Leatherman tools until they start making high quality multitools as they were once known for.
If you want to buy one of these, either for yourself or as a gift, I would suggest you go to a store and look at it before you buy.  Make sure there are no scratches or smeared letterings or any other problems...The ones I recieved were definitely not good enough to give as gifts

I regret buying this gun. It broke within four days of buying it. We did just enough shooting to adjust the hop-up(for accuracy), and it fired great. It was really accurate. The gun was made of really cheap plastic, and the trigger stopped working. Right now, we're waiting for a RMA on it. I would recommend paying a little extra, to buy a more durable gun. I bought another gun that cost $55, and that one is made of much better plastic and feels much more durable

I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son's airsoft rifle as a Christmas gift. The screws were too short to attach it to his Kitty Kat ( a shortened M-4) airsoft rifle's weaver rail. Yes, I could go out and find screws the proper length, but I though I'd make Airsplat do their job. 

So, after several e-mails with the service department, they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size. Wrong. The diameter of the new screws is so big they won't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight. Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws. Take a pass on Airsplat. The sight seems ok for the price.

The specs on the bag stated that there were mesh panels for drainage and ventilation.  Well if there any, I sure couldn't find them.  Not a good quality in a bag used to place wet equipment.  The bag also has an awful smell that will hopefully dissipate over time.  I'm very sorry that I purchased this bag

Bought mine sometime around Christmas and took it into the water for the first time on a trip to St Thomas last week.  It died within 10 minutes of being in the water.  It was never more than 5' down while I was snorkeling.
While I never tested the compass or thermometer against known "accurate" ones, it seemed to work well enough for my purposes.  Just keep it dry

Overall, not terribly happy with this units user interface and design.  The spartan instructions require pressing buttons referred to in the manual as "SW1" SW2" etc, but they are not labeled as such on the device.  You toggle through modes that are abreviated on the display with just 2 letters to tell you what they are ("TR" "CH" what??) Just an unfreindly interface all around. Look for a better unit.

Don't buy this compass if you need to know any direction. If you know about where the sun sets, you will be more accurate than this "compass." It is impossible to use in the field. A waste of money: inaccurate to the max, impossible to maintain it level, etc. Just junk. They should give them away

Had to return the first one due to non-functioning thermo and fault compass. Small is nice for hanging it on keys or pack, but the same smallness makes it a little hard to opwerate one handed. I also have a Brunton compass that fits the hajnd much nicer. We'll see how long the 2nd one lasts

One of the handles would not go in, the digital unit did not work and had no instructions on how to work it and when I would use the unit the little keeper ring on the side would cut into the side of the housing and cause some drag or friction. They told me to send it back for a replacement and I'm STILL WAITING and WAITING!!!  So I Would rate this unit a  -0-  How do I get my monies back???

I ordered this gun because it was such a great deal. When it arrived, i took it out of the box and the barrel was cracked (a big crack), nothing a little gorrila glue can't fix though. Also the accuracy isn't consistent, it is always about 4 or 5 inches off from about 20-30 feet. I had to put the back part of the laser off the sliding mechanism to get it to be accurate, otherwise it was 3 feet high. The pellet also starts to curve after 15 feet or so too. So this gun was a good deal but isn't the best quality gun i've had. You have to load it from the top of the gun, which means taking off the laser, putting in the bbs, and putting on the laser again. The magazine doesn't even come off! It still has decent speed, and isn't crap (it's just bad). It was worth 15 bucks though

The only thing on this that works well is the watch...   the altimeter, thermometer and compass even after being calibrated give incorrect readings...   the stopwatch is difficult to start and stop and reseting it to zero takes some patience...  it looks cool and the time is correct but it is definitely not a reliable device in the least.

As others have mentioned already, I found this thing to be very, very "wobbly". 

I never, ever felt comfortable riding with my (almost 4-year-old) son on this thing. It just felt too unstable.

I returned this after only a few days

I bought the trailer to take my granddaughter with me when I rode on vacation When I assembled the trailer, the chain was twisted.  I bought a chain tool to break the chain and straighten it.  

Then the chain kept falling off the front chainwheel.  The sprocket was badly bent.  I bought a large screwdriver to straighten the chainwheel.  By the time I got it all working, my vacation was over.  

By the time I see my granddaughter again, she'll have her own bike.  I'm going to try to find someone with a small child to give the trailer to

I rated 2 stars because the joint from the kid's bike to the parent bike was too lose and the child was almost falling off from the bike.  I also contact the company who made this product and they told me that they will send another part that will make the child's bike straight, but I never recived the part.  I am very disappointment about because the safety of my kid is first and they didn't help me. I hope that in some future purchase the company can assist me on my needs.

Thank you

Front wheel was badly bent right out of the box and needed to be replaced. Box had no signs of damage so it looks like it was put into the box this way. I replaced the front rim at my own expense and assembled the bike only to find it also needed a tuneup. The gear shifters were not adjusted properly and shifting would often result in the chain jumping back and forth.

I didn't want to pay for a tuneup and hope there wouldn't be other expenses down the road to deal with so I decided to return the bike and buy something local I can get a look at before we buy

My complaints about this stand:
1. By far the worst thing about this stand is it leans too far forward.  There's not enough counter-weight so a slight pull on the bike will cause the thing to tip.  If it wasn't for this, I might say, "well I guess it's alright for 79 dollars."
2. The clamp isn't strong enough to hold the bike securely.  If you clamp to seat-post for example it will rotate on the seat-post.
3. The thing that tightens the clamp is made of plastic.  I'm assuming it will break fairly quickly.
4. The rotator is made of plastic - I haven't tried rotating on the seat post where it would put any weight on the rotator, but I doubt it will hold it.
In my opinion this product should not be sold.  If you just want to clean your bike on a stand, it's fine, but for anything that requires any force like taking the pedals or crank arms off, forget-about-it

I ordered this item, thinking it was a pair.  When I received it and realized my error, I ordered another of the exact same item.  When I got it, I found that it was half an inch wider than the first, a different shade of color, and the pile seemed thinner and flattened.

Now I'm ordering a pair from a different company.  Hopefully the higher price indicates better quality

I tried this on the day I got it to see how it felt.  The velcro is so strong that when I tried to take it off, the velcro ripped the top layer of the material right off.  I would not advise buying this.  I was dissappointed in the quality of this product.

Like you (I'm sure) I saw this machine on television (mistake number one) and then ordered it online without ever trying it first. This machine is a joke. If you cannot get your legs over your head then MAYBE this machine is for you. But this is NOT for serious users who stretch everyday. I can do more with my $5 stretch band from Target than I can with this big heavy space-taking piece of junk. The resistance is zero, and just laughable over all. Save yourself the money, and frustration - buy a lightweight no-hassle stretch band!

I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son's airsoft rifle as a Christmas gift. The screws were too short to attach it to his airsoft rifle's weaver rail. Yes, I could go out and find screws the proper length, but I though I'd make Airsplat do their job. 

So, after several e-mails with the service department, they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size. Wrong. The diameter of the new screws is so big they won't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight. Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws. 

Why by a gun from these guys?  If it arrives broken, you pay to ship it back.  Want a refund?  You pay a 15% restocking fee.  Take a pass on Airsplat.

Its light was okay, although it could not quite cover an entire page of a book. The main problem is it's too shabby to survive a battery change--so you will get just 40 hours of use before it runs out. Also, finding 3V Lithium batteries is not easy.

Not Amazon's fault, but Everlast's.  Even the box promises 2 10-pound weights, but it is in fact a 10-pound set of 2 5-pound weights.  This is not a bargain, but fairly expensive.  Quality is just ok.  Not flimsy or dangerous, but not what I wanted, either

I got this because it was cheap at K-Mart, and thank goodness I can return it. The ball is really small--I love how they omit the size from all of their information. I didn't pump it up with the pump, so I don't know how good that is (I used an air compressor)...the other equipment isn't too bad, but I was really getting this for the ball, which just so happens to be a piece of poopola. I wouldn't suggest getting this

I had a different experience than the other reviewer. I would also consider myself a beginner golfer, but the Medicus has not worked for me.   It might work if you have never picked up a golf club and you are learning for the first time, but if you are trying to improve your swing it doesn't help.  You develop a way to swing the club without breaking the hinge, but it is still a bad swing. 

I heard from a golf pro that it is good if you already have a solid swing and you are trying to improve it, but not good for beginners.

    They say it will be delivered in its original carton, but they don't mention they have been opening up the boxes and swapping out the new console boxes with returned ones.

    The box came with two bright yellow strapping bands, and certainly looked sealed when I signed for it at delivery. Later that evening, when I cut the bands I was surprised when the top lifted open, the staples on the carton top were not attached and the box was already open. I cut the box open and started laying the parts out. when I pulled the carton containing the console out, the box end flap was open and smashed up where it had been put into the styrofoam. every thing else looked undisturbed. I pulled the console out of the box and could see that it must have been returned, the bubble wrap was torn, and the six screws to mount it were missing.

   I called schwinn and they are going to send me the six missing screws, and I called Amazon to tell them what was going on, I would have sent it back, but I had cut the box open and don't think there is any way I could cram it all back together. 

   Just look the box over carefully when they deliver it, the staples on the top were carefully centered between the holes where the longer staples that originally sealed the box were removed. They sure fooled me into accepting a opened box.

The console that came with mine is broken...so I haven't been able to use it.  I have been told by the customer support people @ Schwinn/Bowflex - since the middle of February - that a replacement is on it's way (even the "supervisor" said this to me).  Hear that ticking?  Yeah, that's the clock on my warranty - it is just going away without ever even getting a chance to try the thing out.  Am I happy...NO!!  Maybe I'll write another review when I get my new console and I can tell you how wonderful this piece of equipment is - until then - I'm one heck of a ticked off customer.  Save yourself the headache and just go to the gym

I notice several other reviews mentioning faulty/defective consoles arriving. Well, I received my first Schwinn 438 about a month ago. I put it all together, and realized they did not ship an AC adapter with the machine. I contacted Amazon, they told me to either send the machine back for another or contact the manufacturer. I contacted the manufacturer on Saturday, they were closed. I contacted them the following Monday and they told me the item was on back order, but, I could buy a compatible adapter from Radio Shack. I did. I came home excited to use my elliptical, unfortunately, the console did nothing but beep at me..very frustrating. I contacted the manufacturer again, they advised me that the console was on backorder and would not be delivered for at least 2 months. They recommended I send the unit back to Amazon for a replacement. I did so. I spent the better part of a night taking the thing apart and repackaging it...quite a job trying to squeeze it back in the box. About 3 weeks later, I received my second elliptical. Same faulty console problem, after spending another couple of hours putting the thing together. Contacted Amazon and demanded a full refund and return. They did pick the unit up, and did not make me take it all apart this time, but, I am still awaiting a full refund. I have since purchased a Vision Fitness elliptical from a real fitness shop in my area. I am extremely happy with the unit, although it was a few hundred bucks more. This was one horrific experience with Amazon. I wouldn't recommend buying this product, seems like they are shipping out defective units

This pedometer is so cheap it isn't worth the $1.88 pricetag.  Unless you want to cheat yourself, this is not the pedomter for you.  You gain 20 steps just putting it on your pants, then walking to my co-workers desk five steps from mine I gained about 30 steps.  By the end of my work day I had apparently walked 11,953 steps that I mostly acquired turning in my office chair, and I won't even go on to say how many steps you gain driving in your car.  On top of all this, the company wouldn't refund me on the pedometers I ordered for my co-workers

This pedometer is not very reliable.  It is very inaccurate in its count.  It counts a step at the littlest movement.  I put it on counted out a hundred steps and checked it and it said 260.  Just moving it to look at it recorded more steps.  If you want something really accurate spend more money

I am the captain of a walking team and I purchased several of these pedometers as incentives for my team members.  I wore my pedometer before giving the rest out just to test it.  On the very first day, the pedometer lost count of my steps on three occasions, and by the end of the day, one of the buttons had fallen off.  I do not feel comfortable giving these pedometers to my walkers.  I should have invested a little more money per item to get the best value for my money

I purchased 5 of these for Christmas presents. I tried one out in order to demonstrate at the proper time.
Number 1: This was dead in the box. So were numbers 2, 3 and 4. I didn't bother with number 5. Every flashlight was shaken more than what the measly instructions suggested. Speaking of instructions, they tell you to "make certain the light is off before attempting to charge." There is a rubber button that doesm't click or sound in anyway do there is no way of telling what the on or off position is.
Real junk, says "hummer", made in China and all five are going back

This is the kind of gift you will give to someone you really, really hate. This thing does NOT shuffle plus it WILL eat up your cards badly. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE... that is unless you wish to annoy the hell out of someone and have fun doing so. If you do go ahead and spend your hard earn mula on this purchase, here are some suggestions on how you can use your brand new Card Shuffler. 

1. Pet Dog's Chew Toy 
2. Door Stop 
3. Play Street Hockey 
4. Stress Release Stomping Toy 
5. Mother-in-law Birthday Gift 
6. Modern Art for Coffee Table 
7. Nerf Ball Target Practice 
8. Condom Dispenser 

Kind of think about it, this is a great toy. Have fun! 

PS. If you are looking for a shuffler that really works maybe you should take a look at: Excalibur Professional 6 Deck Card Shuffler; you might like it.

This Fender is WAY to short on a 17" frame with 26" wheels. 80% of the frame were it suppossed to stop the mud and bricks hitting fails badly.  the rear part is abuot 5"+ to short to stop most of the mud.

I got it to stop bricks damaging my Giant bike frame and failed....

2 stars for build of it and the 20% of mud it actualy stops..

DO NOT buy this is you plan it for the same reason i got it for..

When it is windy, the top of a canopy like this needs to be removed to prevent wind damage. No information is available on how long it takes to do this. I called D.C. America and they say they are only distributors and buy it overseas and have no idea and have no manuals available online for me to look at. They said it takes a few hours to assemble or disassemble. One retailer I spoke with, Fogdog, guesses it would need to be disassembled to remove the top, but he admitted they have not tried assembling it.

So it appears from what these two sources said that every time a wind storm comes up, it would require half-a-day to disassemble it then reassemble it - not something I care to do.

Are there any owners out there that can answer this question? Can the frame be left up and only the top covering removed? If so, how long would it take to remove the top covering? Is it easy to do? It is a nice looking unit, but unfortunately the sellers cannot answer the most basic question for an item like this. Thanks.

The accessories that come along with this nice are great, albeit somewhat impractical (who's going to use a slingshot, anyway?), but the thing that stands out most about this knife is the plastic handle.  Survival knives with hollow handles can go either way as far as usefulness and quality, but this handle has a cheap, brittle feel to it that suggests easy breakage.  It's not too hard to conceive that the blade could break off from the handle under enough stress, which makes this blade a dangerous one to use.  Do not buy this knife, or any other knife with a hollow plastic handle

This product never worked -- buttons were defective, it wouldn't stay on, it wouldn't calibrate. The seller - Sky Box USA - wouldn't exchange or refund because I was outside of the "30 day window" (this was a Christmas present, and a very disappointing one at that). You'll want to look elsewhere for technology that should be as reliable as a Casio watch

The IR link for the Polar hear monitors is great.  It allows you to transfer data 2 ways from your PC:  you can download your exercise data, and also change the settings for the watch from the computer.  This is great, because it means no scrolling through abbreviations on the watch with the tiny buttons.
The biggest problem with the IR link is the driver that needs to be installed on your computer.  For whatever reason, Polar decided not to pay Bill Gates to get the software recognized as being compatible with Microsoft.  When installing the driver from the included CD, warnings and error messages pop up to discourage you from proceeding, which will compromise all security and firewall features that you might have.  There is no updated version available for download from the internet.  I went ahead and installed the driver, but since doing so, the computer has not been functioning properly, and I've been getting those "send error report / don't send error report" pop-ups from Windows.  Polar denies responsibility and insists that their driver is "fine" for use.  I'm no computer expert, so I don't know for sure, but I don't believe them

I'm pretty good at getting devices up and running, but this thing is a complete mess. They don't have the software figured out, and the instructions for trying to fix it when it's not working are preposterously complicated. Note that it comes with no directions of any kind. In fact, it arrives with an unlabeled mini-disc with no indication of what it's for, what it is, how to use it, whether everyone needs it, or anything else. Nothing but the blank disc. Note that this device failing to work is a "Frequently Asked Question" on the Polar web site, and they have a list of about thirty things you're supposed to "check," most of which they don't explain as far as what it is you're checking FOR. (In other words, they say "Check the [whatever] setting," but they don't tell you anything about what that setting should be or what might be wrong with it.) Most of the instructions are outdated, don't apply to current version of Windows, or don't reflect current versions of their own software.

Mine will be going back -- the first thing from Amazon I have ever had to return

I bought this ab roller after my chiropractor told me that I needed to strengthen my abs without straining my neck.  The "neck support" that it comes with does not support the neck or head in any way, but forces all of the weight of the head onto the uppermost vertebrae of the neck.  Ouch!  I would strongly recommend AGAINST this purchase.  Not only does it not work properly, but the foam pads were stained upon arrival.  Gross!  I will try another model

After inserted the 9V battery, I just pushed the button to start shuffling one time, and I heard a cracking noise right away. One piece of the mechanism fell off, and I could hear it when shaking the box. Of course, the shuffler was broken...

This is the kind of gift you will give to someone you really, really hate. This thing does NOT shuffle plus it WILL eat up your cards badly. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE... that is unless you wish to annoy the hell out of someone and have fun doing so. If you do go ahead and spend your hard earn mula on this purchase here are some suggestions on how you can use your brand new Card Shuffler.

1. Pet Dog's Chew Toy
2. Door Stop
3. Play Street Hockey
4. Stress Release Stomping Toy
5. Mother-in-law Birthday Gift
6. Modern Art for Coffee Table
7. Nerf Ball Target Practice
8. Condom Dispenser

Kind of think about it, this is a great toy. Have fun!

PS. If you are looking for a shuffler that really works maybe you should take a look at: Excalibur Professional 6 Deck Card Shuffler; you might like it

I wouldn't recommend this shuffler to anyone.  It shuffles more from one side than the other.  When through shuffling on the left side the right side is only half through.  The cards will jam in the tray stopping the rest of the cards from coming down.  The switch just works part time, you have to stop and restart several times

I bought this for my four year old for Christmas.  The net was broken on the second use when my four year old lightly banged it on our car bumper.  A week later, his friend, also four, broke one of the sticks when taking a shot with the feather-weight plastic puck that comes with the set.  Don't waste your money. Even for little kids it's probably worth it to just go ahead and buy real equipment that will last.

To call this a bad machette would be to generous. It is more accurately described as a machette shaped object. 

As other have noted the blade is thin, too flexible, easily rusts, and fails to hold an edge. The handle is poorly made and mine had sharp edges where the handle halves were joined. If you use it without wearing gloves this "tool" will do more dammage to your hand than to the target vegetation. 

Th sheath material is 1 step above paper. Technically it will hold the machette on your belt. But if you draw the machette with anything other than utmost care you will cut the sheath. 

I can't believe a company with a valuable name like Coleman would put their brand on this embarassing piece of garbage.

This tool will not take an edge, either with a grinder or a file.  It is very flexible so that the energy of a blow goes into flexing the blade rather than cutting stems, which has undesirable consequences for your hand.  If you are looking for a useful tool, keep looking

These Coleman machetes are essentially useless.  They are so lightweight and flexible, I don't know what they intended them to be used for.  They will cut some weeds, but they won't cut through brush or any woody plants thicker than maybe 1/2 inch.  I have used a few of these, as they are the most commonly available at the hardware stores where I live.  They also rust badly.  

You're much better off with an Ontario Knife machete, or another better machete.

We were very disappointed with this style trampoline enclosure.  As it only attaches to 4 of the eight legs, it essentially reduces your round trampoline to a much smaller square.  We were constantly trying to find ways to pull it away from the jumping area as it sort of "caves in".  We finally gave up and purchased a new one that attaches on the OUTSIDE of the poles that attach to all eight legs

I was looking for a trampoline and I kept looking around for the encloser trampolines.  I purchased the 13 foot trampoline encloser but I didn't realize that the trampoline came separate.  I have the encloser kit witch I spent $70.00 on and no trampoline.  When I looked on the internet I never saw that the tramponine was separate and it wasn't clearly explained that it was just the encloser part.  I also found out that the size of the trampone is not standard, therefore, in order to utilize the encloser kit, I have to spend another $110.00 for shipping on top of the shipping it cost me for the cover and the encloser kit.  I am really upset that this is costing a large amount of money just because they didn't specifically say that the encloser kit needed the trampoline. Bevery careful, it is not every day that you go out and buy a trampoline and the encloser kits are totaly separate.  I am very disapointed

These noisemakers are too big and hard for my one year old, she bonks herself with them. My toddler and preschooler are not particularly interested in them. They make fairly interesting noises, but are awkward to hold and shake and are somewhat heavy for their size. No one really plays with them much. I would not recommend them.

1. Calories shown during a workout are about 1.5 to 2 times actual.
   I do have the right weight entered in my user profile.
2. Machine broke right after warranty ran out.
   No manual. No reasonable support. I paid $850, including shipping.
   It is now sitting in my bedroom in a state of partial disassembly.
   Nothing about fixing this is intuitive. Some of the nuts and screws 
   are so tightly put on, you cannot budge them.

I am going to throw this junk out and buy a non-schwinn elliptical that
has a better warranty and real servicabilty. Customer support at 
1-800-864-1270 is practically useless.

Save you rmoney. Buy something else

We received this product for Christmas in 2005 and within two weeks the console broke. We contacted Schwinn immediately and was told we would receive a replacement console. It is now May 1st and the console we need is still on backorder --- 5 MONTHS!!!!! It is absolutely ridiciulous. I call each week and I get the same response.

Unfortunately, we should have contacted Amazon within the 30 day period to get reconciliation from Amazon. Lesson learned there.

The product when it was working was fine. But the pain since then is not worth it. 

I do not recommend this product

We bought this trainer over 4 monhs ago from a local fitness store.  From the beginning the heart rate programs never worked properly.  I train using a Heart Rate Monitor so I  can follow my heart rate during excercise,  If we tried to use the Schwinn's 418's HR programs it read anywhere from 40 to  60 BPM too low!!!, What that meant is that the machine kept on increasing the resistance thinking my wife or myself were cruising along at a nice 99 BPM when we were going aerobic at over 150 !!!.  Not only is that  dangerous, especially for someone who never trained before, but it made 30% of the machines functions unusable.  Add a display that's hard to read, controls that are anything but logical, and this unit is a loser, no matter what  Consumer Reports says.  On top of that spare parts took forever to get delivered, and when they arrived, the machine still malfunctioned.  The only thing good out of our experiance was the sales person  who worked with us to exchange the Schwinn for a better trainer from another company.  Bottom line,  stay away from the Schwinn 418, there's a reason Schwinn  only put a sx month warranty on labor and electronics, they knew this machine is worthless, don't you find out the hard way

Warning: Broken after 350 miles..  a post mortem

After 350 miles of moderate usage (6.5MPH average at fairly low resistance for 40 minutes daily) a piece of metal snapped on one of the arms, rendering the trainer inoperable. Unfortunately this was considered a "wear item" and was not warrantied by the manufacturer since the elliptical was used *very* lightly (perhaps 20 miles max) during the first year of purchase (warranty period). I put the majority of mileage on the machine over the past four months and, while it was great for burning calories, I never really felt that it was a "quality" piece of equipment.

It appears that the manufacturer knows what parts of the frame are likely to break first and conveniently labels these "wear items" , thus making repair expensive and difficult... this is in spite of the fact that the piece that broke was a non-moving, load-bearing support piece. Seems a little fishy to me.

Throughout the life of the machine I was constantly tightening bolts to fix the popping and banging sounds that occurred after moderate use, and observed that the wheels would often attempt to jump out of the tracks with heavier use. After about 70 miles I noted that the wheels were leaving large greyish streaks in the tracks from where they were wearing down against imperfections in the track surface. I believe this was also partly due to too much "play" in the interaction of the wheels and tracks, allowing the wheels to jump the tracks a little which each revolution.

This machine does not feel very sturdy and, throughout the last month of its very short life, gave me a creepy sense of impending doom whenever I used it... somehow I knew it was about to break and, unfortunately, it did. My hunch was real enough that I began shopping for a replacement several weeks ago.

Please shop around... I would not recommend this machine for people looking for a moderate to high intensity workout, but it may be fine for slower walking or jogging paced routines that place less stress on the machine's mechanical components. If you are an infrequent user this model may be OK, but if you plan on using it every day I would recommend that you keep on looking.

Note that my machine was a 428P which, at the time of purchase, differed from the 418 primarily in the computer and heart rate monitoring. The frame is identical in the 418 and 428P, which appears to be no longer sold. Since the problems with my machine were directly related to body construction, they are appropriate for a review of the 418. Unless the manufacturer has made major improvements the problems I experienced are likely to still occur. Visual inspection of the pictures here leads me to believe that no major changes have been made to the frame construction

I just bought this through Amazon and then put it together pretty quickly.  Packaging was lousy, as others have already mentioned, and 3 pieces were either missing or broken, so I had to call for them.  First customer service rep was ok, but the next day I found the pedal crank making a sound, and called back, but the next rep claimed that I put the pedals on wrong and refused to exchange the main part containing the gears.  I held up the phone to the machine so he could hear it, and he acknowledged hearing the noise, but said I would have to open up the unit and identify the broken or loose piece on my own.  The unit came w/ that part already sealed, so I don't know how they can expect me to spend my time playing maintenance technician on their product.  Although the product appears to be engineered well, any company that's not willing to correct their mistakes deserves a negative rating

The first Schwinn Fitness 212 that was sent never arrived because it was damaged in transit. The second one arrived but does not work. After calling technical assistance and being instructed to re-examine the contacts (which I did), it still does not work. This is absolutely useless. They will have to do something

This stopwatch has an amazing array of functions but is difficult to use; sometimes it behaves erratically and starts timing up instead of counting down, or starts all over again when the countdown is only half done. Don't know if it's really misbehaving or it's just on some obscure other function when I think I set it for countdown...? Operating manual is available online pdf, and it's several pages long

This would be a great rebounder, if it were not so cheaply made.
One month after happily using it, a spring broke, then another.
It is one of the least expensive models out there and I guess there is a reason for that. Best to save your money and buy a more expensive model

I previously owned and used the 5 mi. version to communicate with my wife while I am going to and from the school bus stop for the kids. From the bus stop the 5 mi. unit was iffy.  I purchased the 16 Mi. units thinking the little extra power and range would make for better receive at the bus stop. It was worse. We received no signal whatsoever, not a peep.  Don't buy this unit. Save your money and buy the 5 mi unit

Just did a A/B comparison between the SX800R (16 mile range)and the Midland GXT-450 (10 or 12 mile range).  Neither radio came anywhere near the effective range advertised.  The Midland lost communcation after 1/2 of a mile apart in the woods.  I then tried both radios on a flat open road.  At 2.9 miles apart, neither radio could pick up it's counterpart.  It wasn't until we hit the 1.8 mile mark that the Motorola picked up some static from the other Motorola.  Still nothing from the Midland.  At approx 1.5 miles apart, the motorola worked fine.  I gave up with the Midland.  The reason I did not give the Motorola a 1 star rating was because I like the weather band feature.  Bottom line is, that unless you are in an airplane with no obstructions at all or curvature of the earth to worry about, forget about getting anywhere near the advertised range.  A good rule of thumb is, if you can see the other person, then you are in range.

I bought this exact one maybe a year ago. About 2 months later it just collapses. Set up is not the onlt thing that is hard, actully trying to get a high jump is VERY difficult. This is a little kids toy but most little kids don't just like baby bounces do they? I would not recommend this trampoline to ANYBODY

I was attracted to the Thermoskin product because it looked more comfortable than rigid splints for night wear, and because Thermoskin advertised that it could be worn while sitting during the day.  The product indeed has a clever-seeming design, and it is well manufactured.  

But ultimately, this product seems to me to be too floppy and unstable to consistently stretch out the area of the foot that FEELS to me like it needs to be stretched. (I.e., the area along the sole of my foot that I can feel stretching out in the mornings when, before getting out of bed and while sitting up in it, I press my toes hard against a looped cord or towel; that stretch significantly diminishes my pain upon standing up out of bed.)  The velcro fastenings are indeed secure, but the product's sock-like sleeve and ankle cuff move around some even when the straps are cinched down as tight as they'll go; as a result, what feels like an appropriate stretch typically disappears in about five or ten minutes of normal movement and friction in bed while lying down.  Worse, the angle created by pulling the strap up through the buckle in front of the lower leg just doesn't create the proper stretch; instead it just makes my toes feel crampy.

I'm going to try a rigid split, which may be less comfortable.  But I believe that I need to be strapped into something that consistently maintains a proper angle, which the Thermoskin product doesn't.  And I'd rather incur some discomfort, if it will actually help me get well, than continue to use this not too uncomfortable (but ineffective) product from Thermoskin.  

Perhaps others have had or will have better results with it than I have had; and I have no medical training nor deep insight into the anatomy or physiology beyond what I've read on the internet, so consider this to be very much a layman's review.  I've been suffering from plantar faciitis now for about four to five months with little improvement, and I can't compare this product to others that I hope might be more effective.  

But I was very disappointed in this product, and regret having spent the money for it

Most enthusiastic cyclists and bike shop clerks I talked to dislike this product. I've used it a number of times myself and I would never use it again (especially after I discovered better products). It turns your chain and drive train into a black mess. Finish Line was better. TriFlow was recommended by a number of cyclists.

We purchased this ATV for our son who turned 7 in February.  The first time he rode it the battery came loose and disconnected.  We fixed that within a few minutes and he continued riding it.  The next day my son came in after riding it and the throttle was loose.  I tried to tighten it but the Allen screw stripped and it would not tighten.  In addition, the rear axle was bent from shipping.  We called service and they sent us a new throttle and tire rims, not axles.  I did not even try to replace the throttle because I knew the Allen screw was not capable of tightening properly.  So, I went to the local hardware store and purchased a stainless steel screw and was able to correct the problem.  The next day after he was riding it the steering was out of alignment so I twisted the handle bars and force them to straighten out.  I have to do this every time he rides the ATV.  The kids rode the ATV yesterday and I changed the speed key switch to the lower speed so my 4 year old daughter can ride it.  I have change the setting about five times and the switch broke.  It will no longer change to the slow setting.  It is either on fast mode or off.  Needless to say that my son does not want to ride on it because he thinks it will break every time he does

I purchased two of these, one for each of my sons. I received them quickly and the packaging was in good shape. When we took the first one out and tightened the handlebars and so on to get it ready to charge and ride everything seemed ok. But the wires where you plug the charger into the 4 wheeler had to tightened and so did the place you turned the key to change speeds. Got it charging, we think. Then we start on the second one. We take it out and the charger is half melted. Ok, not too good but since we ordered two we thought we could just use the charger from the other one since they were the same. Well, when we plugged the charger to the second four wheeler after about 1 hour we went back out to the garage where it was charging and the charger we were using that had come with the first four wheeler had started to melt! Nevermind that the house could have caught on fire! So apparently someone had plugged the original charger in and that had already happened, rather than someone just having packaged a defective charger. Nice for someone to pack it back up and send it to me used and defective. The first four wheeler turned on and ran ok for a few minutes so it must have been charged, we went ahead and plugged it up as the instructions said - as if we had received it brand new like we thought we had. When it was used the first time it ran for a little over an hour, with only the the light popping out of the front with every little bump. And the light didn't work. While trying to re-attach the light we found several places that needed to be tightened up. We can't re-charge it though because the only good charger between the two was melted. When we first took these out of the boxes they were small (big enough for a 3 or 4 year old) but they looked pretty sturdy, much better than the plastic ones you get from Walmart, and I paid close to the same amount. They were difficult to get out of the packaging, because there is a metal frame in the box that needed to be taken apart, but that should have been good, to protect during shipping. However when you think about how you are going to get them back in the metal frame and box and shipping to send them back so someone can possibly see how bad the whole mess is you start to get cranky and tired. I will admit that I haven't tried to return them. I am quite worried that it will be as much trouble as these things have been already. I am tempted though, because I would like to let people know about this type of problem before they waste their money. Imagine how dissapointed I was that right before Christmas I couldn't give the kids two of their bigger gifts because they were junk. I am VERY upset. So now several hundred dollars (times two) that could have bought very nice Christmas presents just flushed down the drain.

Purchased three of these at Christmas.  Horns and lights did not work on but one, another was missing keys when delivered, luckily interchangable.  Within 5 days, one four wheeler had a faulty throttle and quit, the drive train fell out of the other with bolts going everywhere, and the third had two bald tires which burst!  All this before the new year turned.  I contacted the company, and they offered assistance by sending a box of parts in the mail.  However, they offered no assistance on actual repair, telling me that "any man can do it with a few tools".  After several hours and a visit to the tire shop, I fixed the bikes and they seem to work fine for now.  I obviously question the quality of the product and be aware return shipping is not an option b/c these bikes are heavy and it would be cost prohibitive.  I would buy at a store where I could take back if needed.  Good luck.

This is not the same model I bought but it looks like it's built the same way.  I bought the InMotion Trampoline by Stamina and it was completely destroyed in under 3 months with regular use.  It didn't have springs but had elastic bands that ripped off.  When I called for warrantey information, I had waited too long, it is only guaranteed for 90 days.

I'd give it negative stars, but I have to rate it at least 1 star to get the review to show up

I've been using this mat for a little over a month, for a 5 day-a-week practice. At first I was thrilled, but at the end of my 2nd class, I noticed it was looking a little rough where I placed my feet. It's continued to get worse and worse, 100s of little pieces of mat come off during practice, and scatter on the floor around me. Since I practice in a studio, it's particularly annoying. I practice with the "sticky" side down, and the jute side up. The jute side is the side that flakes. Practicing with the jute side down stops the flaking problem, but then the mat inchworms across the floor.

This tricycle is simply way too big.  While the seat position is adjustable, even when adjusted, this thing is simply huge!  I imagine my 2 year old will have to double in leg length to be able to ride this monster.  By then, he'll be 5 or 6 and be plenty big enough for a normal size bike, so I just don't get the point of this.  Why in the world would someone build a trike so big?

I did like that the trike had large pneumatic tires, and was fairly sturdy (at least in terms of construction).  I suppose if you have a really large child that wants a trike instead of a bike, maybe this monster would be OK. I did have a few issues with design and/or build quality though: First, the grips are fairly fragile plastic and I imagine will break after just a tumble or two.  Second, the way the seat "adjustment" works is simply by sliding the seat clamp up and down the main support bar.  This would be OK, but the seat clamp was too big for the support bar, so I had to shim it with something to get it to stay in place.    

Overall, I'm just not very impressed.

This watch has a great look and much potential 'under the hood', but I am having to return mine because of a defective altimeter - it gives readings of up to 1000ft difference in altitude over the course of a few days in the same location during the same kind of weather. 

I was also disappointed to find that the alarm was barely audible - certainly not loud enough to get my attention if it is under my sleeve - and the metal finish of the watch and band is extremely scratch-prone. I cannot recommend this watch for the price it sells for, even if the altimeter worked correctly.

If your toes get hot it has a zipper for that. (useless)  Better off getting a rectangular if you need more legroom.  

Its small (Even the long one)for a big guy.

The bag is nice and everything, but the zipper does not come down very far and makes the bag tough to get into.

Also, my feet got cold because of the zippered area.  Not really sure I understand why it's there.  My feet never get warm, usually cold.

I liek the material and the look.  Also seemed to keep me warm on a 60 deg. night

its rickety. the bar stands are right where you would want to grip the bar so your either way too wide or close on your grip with a constant battle to not pinch your hands when putting the wieght back up. it is also very hard to adjust and often get stuck. in incline position the stands get in your way again because it obstructs your range of motion. not worth half the money it goes for

I figured I'd give these a shot, since I've heard good things about them.  First off, though, to put these tees in the ground, you have to guide them with a finger; otherwise, they'll bend. 

The control and distance differences for me seemed negligable compared to traditional wooden tees.  Also, because of the sharp edges, there are now some nice grooves on the sole of my new 905R.  I wouldn't recommend these tees if you have an expensive club you don't want dinged up, unless those extra five yards really mean that much.  If you have a slower swing speed than I do, though, (mine's about 105-110mph) the grooves might not be an issue.

The only reason that I gave these even two stars is because they last forever.  When I was trying them out, I was playing 18 holes, minus the par 3's, without breaking a single tee. Overall, though, they aren't really suited for me as is

The HR monitor buttons got stuck in the down position on 1st use, no use any more. Also the shape of the back suggests it is designed for small wrists, not at all comfortable on mine

This product was dificult to get a heart rate reading on unless you are walking, would not give a heart rate even at low running speeds. I used this product 4 times and both heart monitor buttons fell off

Don't waste your money unless your workout is sitting on the couch.  This monitor is sold as "providing unobtrusive reading of your heart rate during your workout".  Since you have to stand still to get an accurate reading one has to wonder what type of workout Reebok did to substantiate this claim.  Get a strapped monitor for working out.  While this is a great idea the design doesn't match the intended purpose

I only had the gazelle for one month when the noise began. It started as a low annoying squeak but gradually the noise increased to the point where it is difficult to hear anything else. Very annoying! Also, the calorie monitor is no where near accurate and the heart rate monitor is worse. While it is a low impact machine, it strains the ball of the foot because of the awkward angle of the pedals. This is not the machine to get if you want any sort of a workout. I am selling mine and buying an elliptical machine. Do not waste your money

i bought a supra model gazelle at sears for 179.00. i thought it is so light and the shock absorbers made a good form of resistance. well after a year the welds cracked for the shock absorber holders and are useless so i took them off.the guy at sears(where i bought the junkpiece) says,"Ew,man too bad"!!Remember that the light tubuler construction while making for ease in transport also means ease in breakage. Another machine meant for looking good in leotards sipping a sports drink and put it away if you start sweating.if you dont the sweat will rust out the weld joints and who knows where you'll be catapulted to when the next thing on it goes.maybe Maybe Tony little will give a surprise visit to you in the hospital!

I bought this bag for a 7 day bivouac hunt in the North Dakota Badlands. The average nightly temps were 40-50 F. The bag was warm during these windy and chilly nights. The bag compresses down reasonably small and is relatively light weight. On my second night of the hunt, I was zipping up the bag and the zipper broke right off of the bag. It didn't just come off, it literally broke. There was no way to fix this in the back country. I had my hunting buddy wrap some duct tape around me at night and then unwrap me like a giant tamalie every morning. He spent big $$$ for his bag and of course, had zero problems with it. Oh well, for the price and free shipping, this isn't too bad of a deal, just remember to bring plenty of duct tape with you.

I receieved the Valeo padded straps and headed off to the gym, after waiting a week for the product to arrive with shipping costs more than the cost of the straps which is rediculous. I purchased them after I lost my previous pair of TKO Fitness straps after beating on them for about 4 years with no problems. I put on the Valeo straps and did one pull-up, and one of the straps ripped in half right on the seam where the neoprene pad was sewn in. My advice, this product is poorly made and cheap. A complete waste of money. Go with something better, and I would avoid the padded straps because the extra stitching weakens the strap fabric.

I give it two stars for the Snorkel, the mask and the fins are just JUNK!! 
The Mask: The mask is a purge mask...meaning it has a small disk that, in theory,lets you blow any excess water that enters the mask by just blowing. The problem is this, any speck of debris that gets caught between the disk or a simple malformation will cause water to constantly enter the mask. AND if you happen to suck in via your nose you'll definately get a mask full of water.

The Fins: The're a strap type fin which is good BUT they are so tight you can't wear any dive booties or dive socks which comes in quite handy if you're walking over coral, rocks or any other sharp objects. The biggest issue with the fins is the strap comes off while swimming. This set was for my wife and hers came off I didn't think to much of it until mine did too. You might say, buy smaller fins but they run in a Size x to Size X so you can't buy any smaller. 

The Snorkel is ok, It's a little short but it works

I found these gloves to be OK for short rides, but the stiffness of the material around the fingers made it painful.  I actually had to remove the glove from my right hand after a while because the pain was getting annoying.  Granted, these are Mtn Biking gloves, I don't understand why they would make them so stiff as to actually dig into the hand.  I've tried to break them in, but after a dozen or more rides, they are still stiff

For one, the gun doesnt shoot 380 fps.  Secondly they spelled enhanced "enchanced." They may have even done this on purpose, seeing as you are taking a chance by buying the gun.  It's about 50/50 whether or not the gun comes to you in working condition

Do not buy this gun from Hot Import Toys. That is my main point. It took a very long time to get to me (8 days) and when it did, it was broken. Not that it was shattered or it was jammed. It just didn't work. The piston seemed to be fine, the motor seemed to be connected, the gearbox seemed to be in tact, the batter (although a little hard to install) was charged, and the trigger was connected to the gear box. I thought that I could return it for either a working gun or just a refund. No. I e-mailed HIT over 7 times over the course of a couple weeks. Nothing! I got no response, no notification, nothing. I continued e-mailing them because they didn't even post a phone number to reach them at on their site! HIT is the worst company to buy from ever! From what i see and know, this gun seems to be quite the MPEG! I would have loved to use it to its fullest with my friends but unfortunately, I bet you anyhting that HIT will decide to wait until the 30 day warranty has expired before they e-mail me back: telling me of how the warranty time is up and that they aren't allowed to exchange my product. BUY FROM AIRSPLAT!!! Trust me. This is a good gun. Fast, accurate, good looking. Do not waste a month of your time waiting for it to arrive, having to find its broke, waiting for them to e-mail you back, and then have to live with a broken, useless piece of potential Airsoft gun. So trust me, don't buy from Hot Import Toys

The gun did not work.  When we emailed Hot Import Toys, they gave a suggestion on how to fix it.  That didn't work.  We emailed them asking for a new one.  No response.  We emailed them again, asking for a paid return label since we paid over $20 in shipping and handling.  They told us to take it to Fed Ex and tell Fed Ex it was defective and that Fed Ex wouldn't charge shipping.  Fed Ex doesnt work like that!!  We called this company numerous times, left numerous messages...no return calls.  We emailed Amazon and complained.  Got a response from Amazon and had to pay over $19 out of pocket to send it back to Hot Imports.  Amazon says they will credit our account.  I strongly suggest to take your business elsewhere.  No invoice was enclosed with the product.  My sons friend also ordered from this company and the gun did not work either..

My friend and I both bought this gun. We both charged it for the recommended time and it never worked. I could throw BB's with my toes faster than this if the gun worked on a good day. In ten minutes only 1 BB came out of the barrel and it just rolled out. It doesn't work, 'nuff said. All it's good for now is to be my back scratcher. Buy a pack of bendy straws to shoot BB's, they will work better than  this gun. Thank you for your time. Good nigh

<review_text>
I have an ICS M4A1.  I am basing my thoughts on this based on what some of the airsoft forums I am registered to have said on this.  I am registered on Arnies, Airsoft Core, and Airsoft Retreat.

1) This gun is from a very, very unreliable company (Well), so you have more chances of getting a bad gun than you do for getting a good one.  This is common knowledge among the airsoft community.

2) Lets say you buy 4 of these guns... each of them costing 100 dollars.  Even over a 5-10 year span, that adds up to a lot of money being spent on a gun that breaks consistantly.  People who have skirmished with an LPEG (Low-Powered Electric Gun) find that the exterior can actually break if shot at with an AEG that shoots 330 FPS with .2g (standard for companies like Toyko Marui, ICS, Classic Army, G&G, Airsoft Elite).  The one thing that this suggests that the gun is badly made.

3) The gearbox (part of gun that fires bbs) broke on mine.  In short, it has a metal gearbox, made of the cheapest metal known to man.  The purpose of this for the company that makes to this get money.  It is very, very weak.  Definitely not worth it.

4) The "Hop-Up" on this gun is non-existant.  The fundamentals of hop-up is a backspin is added to BBs to increase range and accuracy.  Effective range of this- 50 feet (not meters).  Effective range of my ICS M4A1 (with a aftermarket tightbore added) is 150 feet.

5) This gun will get laughed at.  Some children walk into an organized skirmish with this LPEG, telling people that it will own all others, and they will cry home when players with real AEGS destroy them.  I suppose it is fine for backyard wars, but who on Earth would spend 100 dollars for a crappy gun for backyard wars?

6) The cost does not equal quality.  If you think about all of the accessories that come with this gun (light, laser, ect), then account for shipping from CHINA, then the packaging costs (pre-molded styrofoam), you will realize that this gun is very, very cheaply made.  You do not want to be spending so much for so little quality.  The laser itself can sell for 20 dollars.

Put it short, it is not worth it

I purchased these so I wouldn't slip on my sticky mat when my hands sweat.  However, they didn't work well for this purpose because there is only one elastic strip that goes between your first and second finger and it allows your hands to slip right through the yoga paws.  Additionally, after only a few classes, the sticky material started coming off of the yoga paws, particularly on the foot paws.  I guess they would be okay for someone who doesn't ever have sweaty palms and who doesn't do any intense postures.  Otherwise, I would recommend doing what I do now - use a pair of weight lifting gloves with a leather/suede palm for extra traction on your sticky mat

The product is well made, and a great idea for travel without a mat.  However, I bought it so I would slip less in my postures once I started sweating.  However, although the paws don't slip on the floor surface, your skin slips out of them when you sweat, making them worthless. Guess I will stick with having a towel around!

Other buyers have warned me that these cards are cheap for a reason. Over 65% of the decks are marked and unusable. That means that at most 25 of the 72 decks will be OK for poker play (unless you're lucky). I have purchase casino used cards before and honestly, they are not worth the trouble

Our three year old twins received two of these cars for Christmas.  The joystick control broke on one of the cars one hour after they received them on Christmas Day!  My husband ordered a replacement car and then shortly after that, the other cars' joystick control broke!  So, now we are stuck with TWO BROKEN CARS and one that does work, but are wondering when that one will break too!  I need to mention that the kids were NOT particularly rough with the cars; we were right there when the other car broke and did not witness any rough behavior.  The controls are cheap and will break eventually.  The cars are very loud, but on the positive side, the kids do love them and provide fun and entertainment for them.  I would definitely NOT recommend this product

We opened 2 Razor Bumper Buggy's for Hanukkah that we got as gifts from a family member.  Both of them were missing the charger for the battery (and other hardware), so our kids couldn't even play with them.  They were very disappointed.  What is worse, Razor's customer service is TERRIBLE!  They would not send us the missing chargers without a receipt.  Of course, since they were gifts, we didn't have the reciept.  Razor refused to help us until we could get proof of purchase from a credit card statement, which won't be for a couple of weeks.  Then of course it will take a couple more weeks to actually get the chargers.  All this hassle, all the hours on the phone, when they could have just sent us the missing chargers, like any decent company would for such a high price item!  

Our poor kids, just looking at their motionless bumper cars.

Of course, we can't actually review whether the prodcut is any good or not until sometime in Februrary when we actually get to use it.  

Happy Hanukkah to you too, Razor

  I didn't want to invest a lot of money in an exercise bike as I plan to use it while recovering from surgery.  This one seemed to be pretty well rated and the price was very reasonable.  It does the job, but only just.  I've had it for about 2 months and the monitoring device has stopped working reliably.  Sometimes it tracks speed/distance/calories/time and sometimes it just won't come on.  At first it worked great.  Also, the seat is not very stable and is a bit wobbly.  Not in danger of falling off or anything, but just not a secure connection to the base.  Overall, the bike works about as well as you would expect one for this price to work, but I did hope for better quality

I bought this on amazon and used the free shipping and received it about a week and a half later... Took it out of the box, it's pretty simple to put together (took about an hour). But after about 20 minutes of riding the bike on tension # 6 the rubber belt has flipped off it's wheel (like a bike chain off its gears). The bike is now completely useless as there is no resistance anymore. And I can't get to the belt to try and fix it because the cover is impossible to take off without breaking it. Tried calling customer service but they are only open on weekdays 9-5, going to have to call them from work on Monday.

Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money to get a more quality item than this. It'll save yourself a trip to the dump, too. This bike is a piece of junk

Description of bike was misleading.  Weight limit of person using this exercise bike should have been part of description.  Small print in booklet accompanying bike says it is unsafe for more than 250 pounds.
Although I weigh slightly less than this, I am afraid to use the bike for fear of it falling apart.  I would not have purchased the bike had I seen this limit in the description.  Also, the directions for operation of this bike are very complicated.  I thought I was purchasing a simple exercise bike, not such a complicated piece of machinery.  This bike would be perfect for a younger, more athletic, slimmer person

Read the ingredients. Contains refined flour and sugar, hydrogenated oil, corn syrup, and artificial colors. For someone who may be sensitive to chemicals diabetic or hypoglycemic, this would be a poor substitute for real food. I personally would become ill from ingesting this sort of thing. Always read the labels and be sure that the product is safe for YOU

     I put this mount on my M-44 today, and I am not impressed.  There is side to side play due to the 1/32 or so gap between the side of the scope mount, and where the original sight seats.  Not a whole lot, but you don't need much play to have your zero [...] out after a couple of rounds.

     All of the set screws are loose in their respective threaded holes.  One of the set screws stripped the scope mount threads before any tension could be placed on it.  The screw that passes through the sight ears was to short to thread the included nut on, so I mounted it with the original set pin for the rear sight.  The mount did not line up with the barrel when mounted, and this was obvious to the unaided eye - the mount was pointing left of true, and I don't know if the scope would be able to compensate!  I don't think Loctite will be able to hold the set screws in place, once a few rounds have gone down range.  Some of the supplied allen wrenches didn't even fit the set screws!

     I have not fired the weapon with this thing mounted, and I am tempted to just toss it and chalk it up as a loss.  The design could work, if a little more attention was placed on the manufacturing process.

     On the plus side, it was cheap, and the shipping was quick.

This compass fails to do the one simple task I purchased it for, which is simply telling me which direction I am going. 

I spent $[...] for a [...] compass made out of crap materials. It works only for the direction you set it at. For example if you set it while facing north, it will be correct when you go north- but if you change directions, the result is completely random....

This compass only works for one direction- and therefore it is utterly useless for a car situation where you actually (gasp) might turn.

absolute rippoff.

The first one I bought started going crazy within a day. The ecreen showed unintelligible symbols and the like. EVentually I could not even power it on. I was told by PNI Global to take out battery and let in sit for 12 hours. Did that then it started breaking down again. The temp sensor did not work because anywhere I placed it it was affected by other sources of heat or cold. They sent me another one which did the same thing. Now I have sent my second one back and they are going to test it and probably send me another one (my third!!!). The good news is that they are nice in customer service

This is a nice heavy item, perfect for covering your trike.  But I have yet to figure out how to put it in place.  I'vr tried all sides and in between but have never gotten it on like the picture.  My son (yes, he is a grown man) put it on better than I had on my tries. but the front wheel is still out.  They need to put some arrows on it or something!!!

I was very excited to order this bike.  As I started to put it together I noticed that some of the prepackaged parts for assembly were missing!  I still attempted assembly and noticed that pre-drilled holes weren't even close to being inline with the display!  The largest drawback and thing that upset me was that I didn't pay close enough attention when purchasing this - it is DOES NOT allow for adjustment from seat to pedals.  I'm 6'3" tall, and not being able to adjust for my height makes this completely unusable

As a bicycle enthusiast who has owned CatEye products for nearly 20 years, I eagerly attached this light to by mountain bike and went for a spin around the streets and trails of Manhattan. Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed with its overall usability. 

The light uses three intense bluish-white LEDs that are very easy to see from a distance when facing the light. However, these are not powerful enough to illuminate a trail, road, or pothole. In short, the light is excellent tool to acknowledge your position to oncoming motorists and other cyclists.  The flashing mode is especially easy to see. Yet, the light is simply not powerful enough to illuminate the ground before you.  Hence, it is basically useless if you are trying to avoid potholes on roads or vehicle barriers on poorly lit bicycle trails.

Pros
Good Construction
Multifunction
Waterproof

Cons
Insufficient brightness
Uses AAA instead of AA

I recently bought the Gaiam 4mm Eco Conscious Rubber Yoga mat because i want to practice my yoga on a environmentally friendly high quality mat.  After receiving this mat, i am EXTREMELY disappointed.  I feel cheated.  They claim that it is 4mm, but i measured it to be 2mm between the bumps and maximum 3mm on the bumps.  The mat is very flimsy,stretchy and slippery.  After 1 use it looks like it is rubbing apart.

Gaiam claims that it is a natural rubber mat, but it sure does not feel like a natural rubber mat.  I have used a natural rubber mat at my studio, but it is completly different that this mat.  Even my instructor questions whether this is actually a natural rubber mat, since it feels so different than the high quality natural rubber mat at the studio.  If i wanted a cheap mat, I would have just bought one of the low quality PVC mats.  I should have spent the extra $5-$10 and bought a mat from a company that is know for their quality.  Dont make the same mistake i made

Given the picture shows a spike on it, one could have the impression that it is big enough to spike into the ground and mark a trail or something... well, the spike is more like a thumbtack.
I realize the images are provided by the manufacturer, so I don't blame Amazon - but there is NO excuse for not accurately listing the actual size of this.

This case is mainly MADE OF PLASTIC!!  Don't be fooled by the "aluminum" description, only the corners were aluminum, the rest just PAINTED PLASTIC.  The case came poorly packaged!  The box was too small for the case.  The case had scuff marks, and scratches on it.  Obviously NOT BRAND NEW!!  This was the worst purchase I've ever made on amazon.  Will never buy ADG SPORTS again!!!  Their label was crooked on the case too!!  Looks like a 4-year-old put it on!!  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!  TRUST ME!!

I purchased 3 of these for a very old bike with no holes to mount a water bottle.  One of them worked perfect, snug fit and everything worked.  The other 2 had nuts that were too large to fit in the plastic.  This is my second, and last purchase from Zefal, I was happy it wasnt made in China... but i guess the French dont believe in good quality merchandis

Okay, I have owned the Mio for 9 months now and I agree with all of the above complaints, it is not accurate, it can be difficult to run and check heart rate at same time, it's big and clunky looking, etc, etc.
My biggest beef is that this watch broke 6 months into the game.  The heart rate monitor got stuck and rendered the watch useless.  I returned it to Mio (with my $10.00 check) and 2 months later, i still have not got my watch back.  I complain regularly and they reassure me that it is being repaired in their factory.  They assured me that finally after I threw a fit, it would be shipped last week.  still no watch.  The watch not only sucks, but the company sucks as well.  save your money and buy an ironman.

Though the concept of a Heart Rate Monitor without a chest strap sounds convenient, the MIO is of absolutely no use during your workout. You have to stop your activity (be it running, biking or walking) to measure your current Heart rate, as your hand has to be steady. The calories feature does not measure the calories burned accurately and was off almost by 100 calories.

There is nothing wrong with this product, it's how you use it. We almost ruined our $300 trampoline in it's first week by using this product. We put it on our new trampoline and it fit fine. It rained the next day and filled completely with rain water, causing the trampoline to nearly collapse. It took a huge effort to remove the water out of the trampoline cover and we have not used it since. Trampolines are constructed using fabric that is breathable and will let the rain run through. By covering it, you don't allow it to drain. Unless you live in a VERY dry climate, I don't advise using a cover

This cover works well with keeping leaves and such off of the trampoline; but every single time it rains, I have to spend an hour or so getting the standing water out from the middle!  It is a back breaking job and it is hard to understand why trampoline covers are not made to handle this correctly.  More damage is done to the trampoline with the heavy water sitting there than leaves and limbs falling on it! This is a worthless item

I take yoga in a gym.  The class starts as the aerobics session ends.  I bought these socks to help keep my feet warm during class.   Using the socks my big toes were uncomfortably separated from the rest of my foot.  I expected more elastic.  They made my foot cramp during the class.  Because I had worn them once I could not return them.  Now I do not know what to do with them.  I should throw them out but I spent money on them

I got this watch to help me decrease my times for 5k, and it defiantly not 95% accurate.  I run ~10-11 minute mile; yet, both on the treadmill and outside, this watch was reading ~7.5 to 8 minute mile.  Distance was also off by +20%, when running.  

Speed and distance ~98% accurate for walking 15 min/mile.

I bought this unit two months ago and since that time I have used it sparingly. I went to turn it on today and it was dead. So I went out and bought a new battery and replaced the old one. Still dead. I tested the battery on a meter and it was full of juice, unlike this so called 'rugged' unit. A total waste of money, be forwarned

Have been using this for a couple of days now and sorely disappointed. If you move the compass (of your own choice or it falls off the windshield), you need to recalibrate it. I've been sitting at stop lights and seen a 10 swing of direction. I have no intention of keeping this because of its lack of user friendliness

I should have heeded the bad reviews on this site.

I purchased this as a Christmas gift and tried to set it up for the recipient.  It was dead on arrival.

I tried a new battery, still dead on arrival.  Both batteries tested OK, clearly it's a dead unit.

I contacted the new manufacturer (NOT PNI as advertised) and am awaiting a response.

I can't recommend this product.

I bought this product on a Friday and arrived on a Thursday...Good shipping time but a horrible gun.  The pieces are hard to assemble and made of cheap plastic.  The whole gun was made of a cheap plastic which is not worth buying. I payed $30 for this gun and wasted my gift card for my birthday...Complete waste.  The laser's wires split, the gun does not shoot fully automatic and the FPS (feet per second) is slower than my Berretta Pistol.  Also the binoculars are cheap as well...it is just a gimmick to make you buy the product. Use your best judgement when buying this gun but it was not worth the $

My little girl was supposed to get this bike for her birthday (8/28) and due to missing parts. I was under the impression that i was buying a new bike not a used one. For the price i paid i should have gotten a new bike not a used bike that no one wanted. We have been having to go and order parts for the bike. The bike came with scratches and the bottles of paint that came with it were all dried out. The box that the bike came in was in horrible condition, it seemed as if it was left out in the rain for about a year. Then someone tried to tape the box together and ran out of tape. There were holes all over the place and i can see why i am missing most of the bolts and nuts.
We were very disatified and when i called to complain the girl who answered hung up on me. I am very unhappy and this will problaly be my last order with this comapny.

The overall steel frame and structure of it is good, but there are too many flaws with this product, I recommend going with something else.  

Flaws:  
1) Bands do not give you good increments of resistence.  If you want even resistance on each side, you go from 20 lbs to 40lbs in one setting, which is crazy.  

2) Workout and Assembly manuals are terrible.  Especially the Workout manual - what use is a machine if the correct use of it is not demonstrated?  What does that really say about how much Stamina cares about people using it correctly, without injury, and getting good benefit out of it?  Only about 10 exercises are really shown, the rest are just single pictures that let's you vaguely guess at what you are supposed to do, except that many are for some other machine, not this one. I'm sure someone will get injured from incorrect use.  

3) Many of the pictures are misleading, such that you can't actually do many of the exercises suggested or inferred by the pictures.  One customer service person told me the pictures were of some prototype machine.  Ridiculous. 

4) Several construction pieces I received were bad and caused problems, but replacement parts were shipped with no problem, albeit it meant waiting a week or so for each one, and then time to reconstruct the machine.  I had to replace the main Rail and a main leg support frame piece because they were both welded wrong.  

5) Leg padding is inadequate and painful

6) Doesn't seem to be a product that is understood or cared about by Stamina, no one I called seems to use it or really can tell you about it.

For a company that claims to care about health and fitness, they really don't show it with this product or support for this product.  I'd go elsewhere.

I bought this for my 5-yr-old, and he can't even get it on his head.  He wears other youth bike helmets, so I wouldn't recommend this item unless it's for a 2-3 yr old.  Now I have to pay half the price in return shipping

This bigwheel is so poorly made.  You have to affix the pedals and they do not stay on.  We put duct tape around the rod that holds the pedals on so they would stay.  The seat back has cracked already and we've only owned it one month.  The tassles on the handles don't stay in and the wheels are completely smooth so they offer no traction.  Lastly, there is no breaking mechanism.  Anyone who remembers riding a bigwheel knows that having a break is a must if you like to "skid out"!  Keep looking.

A real colorful and flashy bike, however there were several things wrong with it.
 1. the tires had so much excess rubber, it had to be trimmed or else it rubbed.
  2. The back wheel had to be completely removed to loosen the bearings. If not done, the bike would basically come to a stop by itself.
  3. the main (front) sprocket is slightly bent, so the chain falls off constantly.
  4. the bike if VERY heavy. maybe that makes it sturdy, but it also makes it tough for a 4 year old to ride. 
I should have just bought a bike off the floor at Wal-Mart or Target for half the price

I ordered this Pilates ring because I had used one in my health club- big mistake.  It is plastic with little resistance and is totally useless.  Wouldn't even be of much use for a wheelchair-bound old lady.  (The vendor sent it fast though.

Well, first of all, I never folded it up, because it was very difficult to fold, so I would just roll it into a closet.  I would jump on it everyday for an hour and it was great low impact exercise.

I had it about 3 months and the suspensions snapped and I had a good shock as my feet suddenly hit the floor hard.  I weigh 110 lbs!  I really wonder how long this trampoline would last with a heavier person.

If I could give them 0 stars, I would.  I don't know why they even still make these, as they should be illegal--and so should all that laminated foam rubber stuff they use in karate.

The materials break up easily; the stuffing shifts and starts flying all over the place.  I could give tens of reasons why these are not only inferior, but complete garbage right out of the box.

Everlast in general simply isn't good: low quality materials, design and workmanship, but these win the prize for all time worst sports equiptment in my book.  

I recommend buying entirely Ringside--and this is coming from an experienced full-contact fighter

If you study Pilates then you will see how the performers do not have the proper body positions. One of the girls keeps staring at the camera for no reason and moving her body when it should be still.

As a lover of Pilates and how much it has done for me, I urge you to buy something else

The description for this product states heavy gauge steel construction , but this only applies to the top section. The bottom straight section is made of cheap plastic . On top of that , of the 4 holes for the screws to go into mine had 2 of those stripped with a metal backing completely missing on one of them . Even the cheap logo stickers where placed completely off center , though that I could care less about.

If I had to do it all over again I would have purchased "Perfect Pushup" by Bodyrev which amazon sells

DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT BUY ANY PRODUCTS FROM THE WESLO COMPANY. I just received my "Weslo Cadence C44 Treadmill" and have attempted to assemble it. The handrail holes are not drilled in the proper spots so that they may be attached correctly to the console. The Customer Service numbers are all disconnected. Their website gives an additional number to call, and a recorded message tells you to either call the now disconnected numbers, or puts you on hold for about 2 minutes before it hangs up on you. I have wasted an entire afternoon trying to contact them. This company is a complete scam. If you are even considering buying one of their products, your money is better spent getting your head checked

Our three year old twins received two of these cars for Christmas.  The joystick control broke on one of the cars one hour after they received them on Christmas Day!  My husband ordered a replacement car and then shortly after that, the other cars' joystick control broke!  So, now we are stuck with TWO BROKEN CARS and one that does work, but are wondering when that one will break too!  I need to mention that the kids were NOT particularly rough with the cars; we were right there when the other car broke and did not witness any rough behavior.  The controls are cheap and will break eventually.  The cars are very loud, but on the positive side, the kids do love them and provide fun and entertainment for them.  I would definitely NOT recommend this product

We opened 2 Razor Bumper Buggy's for Hanukkah that we got as gifts from a family member.  Both of them were missing the charger for the battery (and other hardware), so our kids couldn't even play with them.  They were very disappointed.  What is worse, Razor's customer service is TERRIBLE!  They would not send us the missing chargers without a receipt.  Of course, since they were gifts, we didn't have the reciept.  Razor refused to help us until we could get proof of purchase from a credit card statement, which won't be for a couple of weeks.  Then of course it will take a couple more weeks to actually get the chargers.  All this hassle, all the hours on the phone, when they could have just sent us the missing chargers, like any decent company would for such a high price item!  

Our poor kids, just looking at their motionless bumper cars.

Of course, we can't actually review whether the prodcut is any good or not until sometime in Februrary when we actually get to use it.  

Happy Hanukkah to you too, Razor

Basically the title says it all.  I figured for a 100 dollars I would get a nice green and that the break would add to the challenge.  Basically this is a poorly made toy that shouldn't cost more than about 20 dollars much less a hundred.  Like I said in the title if you want an overpriced piece of junk then you hit the jackpot with the Tru-Break Putt 'n Hazard.  The only thing this is a hazard to is your wallet

I was disappointed in this product, and returned it - and bought "crank" type no-battery flashlights instead.  There were two things I disliked about the Diamond flashlight.  First, the light lasted a very short time - after shaking vigorously for a couple of minutes (they recommend just 90 sec. for a full charge), I turned the light on, and in less than 5 minutes it was very dim and almost useless.  I tried this a couple of times, with the same results.  The other problem was that shaking it for 90 sec. turns out to be a LOT more work than you would think!  I am much happier with both the light output and the ease of use with the crank type flashlights I replaced these with

Thi is HotImportToys at their finest. They are advertising this as a bullet(bb) proof mask for use in airsoft. That leads me to question why in the upper left corner it says "Not suitable for children under 3 years." Now, why would it say that? This mask is meant to be a toy, yet H.I.T is saying this will stop bb's. Don't they realize that by misleading people like this those people could be seriously injured, or even killed??? I think this really needs to be looked at by Amazon. This could seriously kill someone

I bought both the Nordic Gear batter-heated gloves and battery-heated mittens. Neither product provides adequate heat. The batteries work; but you get only a tiny bit of warmth. I see from the other reviews that my complaint is common. I wish I had read the reviews before buying

Battery powered gloves; little heat for a lot of money

I bought these gloves for my wife who has problems keeping her hands warm. The description of the gloves would have you believe that the battery powered gloves (using D cell Batteries) would provide heat to the hands for 6 to 8 hours.  In actuality, the battery will only provide heat for 35 to 40 minutes before it ends.  To make matters worse, the only heat provided is to the palm of the hand, no heat is provided to the fingers!

I did not use a cheap brand of battery for these gloves.  The first battery that I tried (it takes one D cell per glove) was Duracel with an experation date of 2013 (in other words, brand new battery with lots of shelf life left).  That battery provided heat for 40 minutes before dying.

The second set of batteries that I tried (with the same experation date) were made by Eveready.  That battery lasted 35 minutes.  You should also note that the Duracel fits poorly in the connector case and the Eveready battery fits even worse!

These gloves are on their way to Goodwill.  Maybe they can be used by some one as work gloves or something.  

If you are considering these gloves, think again!  The chemical packs work much better although they (the chemical packs) do have a shelf life.  It just seemed such a waste to us to use a chemical pack for a one hour walk and then have the pack continue to provide heat for another 4 to 6 hours.  Still, that is better than using up two D cell batteries for less heat that only lasts about 40 minutes.

I trained for a marathon and several 10K races using a heart rate monitor. They are very good instruments for training and I recommend them to everyone who wants to lose weight or get in shape. After you've purchased one or two of them, you become a better shopper. I purchased an F-4 for a friend, and I was very, very disappointed in the battery life when I found out how soon the battery in the main unit wore out. Some of the newer heart monitors - Nikon for one- have user replaceable batteries so you can save a lot of money and time replacing batteries after one or two years

Not very bright for an LED.  AND, guess what? This is about 2 1/2 inches long if it is standing on its tippy-toes!
Given the picture shows a spike on it, one could have the impression that it is big enough to spike into the ground and mark a trail or something... well, the spike is more like a thumbtack.
I realize the images are provided by the manufacturer, so I don't blame Amazon - but there is NO excuse for not accurately listing the actual size of this.

I was impressed by all the reviews that said that how quiet the machine was when I bought it.  Assembly was not so bad (2.5 hours).  Then the squeeking started.  Just about after 100 calories burned, there would be a two distinct squeeks at a specific position of the flywheel.  We called technical service and the service person called back on the 5th day (he needed to respond before 5 days) and scheduled a visit for a day 10 days AFTER that.  The technician inspected the machine and said that such sound was normal, and adjusted the tension on some screws and left.  Now the squeeking is starts right after beginning the workout.  It is LOUD.  As in, you need earplugs, loud.  Another call to tech support...

When I saw that most of the critical parts, the ones that bear the brunt of the force were made of plastic, I told my wife "this isn't going to last long."

In the very place I had concerns is where mine broke.  A simple metal pin, instead of a plastic one would have made all the difference.

I also just noticed in these "customer reviews" that right after someone posts a negative review, a positive albeit anonymous review is posted.  That always makes me wonder

The first time I used it, I hit it about 20 times before the ball broke off and went flying into nearby woods.

My Mom had ordered it from Sharper Image.  She called them and they said the would replace the ball.  They never did. 

I have not found a place to order replacement parts.

I don't recall ever being quite as disappointed with a product as I am with the Swing Groover II. Last night I went to the driving range to check some yardages of my clubs, just so I could verify the accuracy of the Swing Groover.  
  
 I was hitting my 5-iron between 180-190 yards most of the time, occasionally hitting 200. My 7-iron was flying about 165 yards. Tonight, I just finished setting up the Swing Groover. My first few swings with a 5-iron produced readings of 133 yards. I warmed up a little more and started hitting the 7-iron. These swings produced readings of 121 yards, with an average of 121. 
  
 This product is designed to indicate swing speed and yardage hit. The yardage is off by about 50 yards, but believe it or not, I think the swing speed indicator is probably pretty accurate. With the 5-iron, it was indicating a little over 70 mph. I've had my speed tested before with the driver and it registered a little over 100 mph, so this number of 71-73 with the 5-iron sounds reasonable.  
  
 I'm not sure if I just got a defective machine or what exactly the problem is, but I'm very disappointed. I'm very inclined to think I just wasted $150. 
  
 My suggestion is to keep looking for other products, because this one is horribly inaccurate

Hydrolized Gelatin is the 3rd ingredient after the chocolate coating and protein blend.  Do a search on that and you'll discover that it comes from processing pork skins and cow bones.  Mmmmm. Doesn't that sound good?  What's more - this gelatin protein is incomplete, so it doesn't really do anything to help grow or repair muscles.  It may taste OK, but you can find protein bars with higher quality protein in them. Or just eat Jello if you really want gelatin. 

Avoid ones with collagen too.  Same issue

While this is a cheap product and worked great for the first application/session use of 20 min, the second time I tried to use it the belt failed after 5 min.  Even after getting new batteries (which turned out NOT to be the problem) I tried to get the belt to work like before but realized I was "scammed".  It is a cheap plastic belt that seems to be the answer to all your problems but really just creates new ones

Yes, you'll feel your muscles contracting. If they were really contracting to a  degree worthy of being called exercise, the contractions would scare the heck out of you: You'd either feel like your whole core was paralyzed or you'd be going into an spastic, involuntary crunch. Don't worry, that won't happen. The machine isn't strong enough. (Try this: Tense up your abs..more..a little more...relax and do it again a few times, for a minute or so...thats already WAY more exercise than you'll get from the 'Ab Sonic'.) If you're a therapy patient who has a poor muscular awareness, perhaps this will help you begin to get enough feeling back to move on to a real exercise program. If your spinal cord is severed, this may be all you can do to get a little musuclar stimulation...fine. This is not exercise. It may 'remind' you to tense your abs in order to not look like a fat slob, but why not just remind -yourself-? It's not powerful enough to do do any real strengthening, and even if it was, it by-passes the most important part of your  workout: the will. You  aren't learning the effort of tensing the muscles, or tolerating greater stress, you're just electronically agitating the muscles. In the end, this has ZERO effect on strength, muscular development, work tolerance, and function. Are you in therapy? No? Then why are you trying -so hard- to avoid -moving- your body

I bought this item based on other people's reviews. I'm sad to say they were wrong. Maybe it's just my individual toy but it really did not work properly out of the box. The gun starts doublefeeding pellets as soon as I started firing it. It sprayed pellets in everywhich direction except for where they were supposed to go. My recommendation, well, just look at my title.

Let me just start by saying this gun is terrible. The images are misleading; the gun looks to be of a shiny more durable plastic, but it is a dull black. And it smells really badly at first. Not once did the gun shoot over 100 fps, and is sold at 300. My friends didn't even notice being shot. I have a 300 fps pistol, it leaves welts through jeans. This ISNT 300 fps. It's a rifle fit for an infant who's been dropped on their head and thinks it's good. never even shot farther than 80+ feet. bad buy

I bought this elliptical three month ago unwilling to pay big bucks (over $1,000) for recommended models, hoping to make an exclusion from the rule.
No, it did not happened. Starting with the errors in assemble instrucions in the manual, inaccurate display readings, and so on, ending with a squicky and noisy piece of ... equipment.
Their customer service is just a place to order parts, although they sent me some parts I broke when assemling - a threat on the bolt, a couple of broken (by me) plastic part. I noticed that I'm using this machine more rarely because I just don't like the way it works.
If I new what I was going to get, I did not buy it

I bought this for my wife because of it's low cost. You get what you pay for. She uses it a few times a week. After a little more then a month, the left pedal broke. She is not overweight at all, so that wasn't the problem.
I'll spend the money for a good one next time

This is a very heavy machine so make sure you have help if it is going up the stairs.  It is fairly quiet, not silent.  It is shakier than I had hoped.  The wire to the monitor came broken.

I recently purchased the Stamina Elliptical. It took me a day and a half to put together. The meter didn't work so I called customer service and they sent another one out immediately. It makes a lot of noise and it's not very sturdy. I would return it but it would take too long to dis-assemble. I wouldn't recommend this product.

This imported 'sword' is actually a long dagger, about the size of a WWII-era bayonet.  In the scabbard it is all of 15 inches.  The construction, fitment of parts, finish, and overall quality is poor.  Definitely a mass-produced, low quality item.  The blade is plain stainless steel and would not hold an edge.  It would properly be labeled a "Masonic-ish" sword as the symbolism on the handle, guard, and scabbard do not strictly conform to those of any branch of Masonry.  There are prominent red crosses and a few Knights Templar-ish symbols but no one that knows anything about Masonry would mistake this for a genunine implement.

The blade is sharply pointed so this is NOT something children should play with!  It looks okay hanging on the wall (in the scabbard) but that is about all it is good for.  The price is not a bargain, it is about right for a Chinese-made import of this size and quality.

As long as you don't expect more that what I have described, you might like this item

If it is kept in the hilt, it makes for a decent wall piece.  If you pull it out of the hilt, it is not a good thing.

My sword has a bent blade, and a bent handle, which was noticable while in the hilt.

I would not spend the money on this item

If you need a "starter" or "disposable" bike carrier, this might be okay, but not suitable for longer trips or valuable bikes.

Good parts:
Cheap, $99

Bad parts:
1.  Cheap
2.  The adapter for a 2" reciever hitch is horrible, you'll have to shim it, jury-rig something, or go to a parts store and pay for a workable one.
3.  Way too much sway, which is obvious as you put it together.  Turning corners in town have you checking your mirrors with concern.  Multiply the effect for highway speeds or bumps.  Would need to rig something.
4.  Straps holding the bikes.  Cheap, rough on your bike, and not very tight.

In summary, if you want to spend alot of time rigging it up to save a few bucks, it might be worth it, but out of the box, I wouldn't trust any worthwhile bike or vehicle with it

I gave this product one star because it was the lowest option. What I really give it is this: WARNING! The outback hitchback 4 product is a dangerous piece of junk. I installed it on my Suburban (which required the - needs to be redesigned - adaptor to 2 inch) and put one full-sized and three kid bikes on it. It swayed a range of 10-12 inches newly installed. My wife  had went on the Target web site earlier and read that the sway was normal. By the time I had traveled 1/3 of the way back to the Bay Area from LakeTahoe (in the middle of the night) I noticed in the lights of the car behind me the hub of the full sized bike wheel sticking out from the side of the vehicle. I pulled over in the dark and checked it out. Due to the constant side-to-side motion of the winding mountain roads the main metal braket had bent and the sway had increased to a now dangerous 2 feet! Needless to say the rest of the four hour trip was nerve racking. Roping the rack to try and stabilize it. I'm taking the rack back to Target

The first time we set the arbor up we found the top would not fit over the frame.  Two parts pulled off the top trying to get it to fit.  The seller forwarded the photos and complaint to Texsport and they sent us another top.  When we put that top on we found the same thing.  That is when we found the frame was 4" longer than the top.  There were seams that were not sewn properly and there was a hook missing on one corner.  After cutting the poles down we were able to get the thing put together.  When next spring comes we will replace this one and I can assure you it will not be a Texsport product

I got this Zafu(meditation cushion.) It is round in shape and too  high and bulky to be comfortable to sit on, around 9 inches high and 15-18 inches in diameter. It is also pretty heavy, around 4 pounds due to the sheer size.

I could not sit comfortably on it due to this reason returned it. I would recommend trying it somewhere before buying.

The filling seemed of good quality

I got this item to give a a gift.  I got it fast, however opened the bag to find out the zipper was completely broken.  It wasn't worth returning it because if you've opened it you can only get a 50% refund and have to pay shipping, which would have cost more than what I would have been refunded.  Don't bother with this one

The literature describes this unit as a flat-mount ski rack compatible with any factory-installed roof rack with crossbars.  Hardly.

My vehicle is a 2006 GMC Envoy with a factory roof rack.  This rack is the same one used on many GM SUVs, so great numbers of them are out there.  These racks have crossbars with a "reverse wing" shape that are tilted forward, presumably to reduce wind noise.  The Thule "universal" mounting system will not conform to these crossbars, and will only mount with the ski rack tilting forward (or backward) at a silly angle.  It can be used in this conformation, but it looks odd.

Also, the ski rack indeed locks over the skis/boards, but the mounts are not lock-protected, so the entire ski rack and contents can be easily stolen with standard wrenches.

My searches found no alternative to this rack, however, and it does work for the intended purpose

This is a $22 tee ball? Maybe they have the decimal in the wrong place, since these should cost about $2 at your local sporting goods store. Maybe they comes 10 or 12 to a package (but it doesn't say that clearly on the page).

Bottom line is don't buy this until they clarify the pricing issue

I was unable to use this treadmill for several reasons. One, the belt will not stay centered. It shifts to one side and then starts rubbing on the metal guides intended to keep it centered. If I were able to get the belt to turn with out a large amount of force, the second problem, it would soon be torn by the guides. As I said the second problem is the belt will not move without a lot of force. I had to lean over and put so much force down that after only 3 minutes my legs were cramping. If I tried to stand up and just walk normally the belt would not move. Also like others several of the plastic knobs were broken and it was either a used unit or the numerous scratches happened during shipping

This is the worst purchase I have made from Amazon or anyone else. The "first" unit arrived with several parts broken and the tread immovable. After a number of calls to tech support, it was decided to return and replace the unit. Amazon promptly replaced the treadmill. This one had a movable and usable tread but the electronic display did not function. My friend at tech support did not have a clue. He suggested that he send me all the electircal cables used on this unit. It is not clear what I am to do with them. I strongly recommend that anyone wanting a manual treadmill puchase it from a diffrerent manufacturer

This is not as described..it is very hard to move - heavy and bulky. If you have a place to set it up and leave it, fine, but this is not going to be pulled out every day for a 'stroll in front of the TV', as described.  Performance-wise it seems very nice and is a good solid piece of equipment, but definitely not an item that can be put away after each use.  I'm disappointed

The goal arrived at my house assembled wrong, then after it was fixed be me, I successfully put it together, which was relativly easy.  After several moderately hard training sessions two large holes were in the net.  That is on top of the fact that the pins that hold the net together are weak.  The weakness in the pins causes the goal to collapse if there is a shot off of the post.  Overall, this is probably not a good buy.

Prior to purchasing this item, I read a review that one should instead look towards a product that pulls up from the base of the foot and not the toe.  I wish I heeded this advice because, on top of fasciitis, I developed severe toe pain by using this product.  I then had to by a second product anyway that, thankfully, eliminated the toe pain.  Even though this is less expensive than other night splints, it may do more harm than good.  Go with a firm, non-toe injurying splint instead

Maybe the S120 will work for you, but it was nothing but trouble for me.  I bought it because of the great features and price, but returned it because of all the problems: 1) The manual is anything but friendly, e.g. after completing the 11 steps to set the date you are then told that there's a short cut.  Thanks.  2) After spending much more than an hour with the manual just to get the basic settings in, I'm off to exercise.  Great start, the reading is my usual pulse around 55, then it drops out to 0.  Ok, maybe the contacts are too dry, so I wet them.  Off I go again and the pulse rate measures 204 then to 0.  Ok, maybe the chest strap is positioned poorly.  Different position, same result -- measured pulse rates all over the map.  I decide to forget what the monitor records and finish my exercise.  Final result -- I got periods of reasonable heart rates, but lots of time the values were either 0 or over 190.  The next day I try again with the same result -- drop outs and then sky high readings.  It went back later that day

I ordered the Igloo quick and cool 150 from Target. I had it 2 days after ordering. It was a very nice cooler but very clearly quite used. Back it went. Be careful ordering from Target in January. They have to do something with those Christmas returns. Check out the product carefully.

The medicine ball was ordered for a gift and when it arrived, it was very scuffed up and scratched.  It also had a flat spot on it.  I returned it for a replacement, which I got, and it was in the same condition.  Also the packaging was tore as if it had been opened before.  I  would recommend buying in a store so you can look at it.  We also had the same experience above with the 6 lb. medicine ball and the same outcome.  Definitly not happy with it

Don't ever buy this. It is a rip off and a gimmick. Your hands will get tired really fast for shaking the flashlight and 30 seconds of shaking will not even get you 5 minutes of light with consistent brightness. Even more the light dims almost instantly after shaking with no retention of charge whatsoever. Other flashlights that require cranking can give up to 2 hours of light for 1 minute of cranking if you get the right one

LIVING IN FLORIDA I BOUGHT TWO OF THESE EVERLIGHT FLASHLIGHTS. 
THE PARTY THAT SAID THERE WAS ENOUGH CHARGE DURING SHIPPINS IS A LITTLE SHAKING IN THE HEAD. IT TAKES AT LEAST A COUPLE OF MINUTES OF OF SHAKING BEFORE THERE IS EVEN A GLIMMER OF LIGHT. AFTER THAT IF YOU DON'T CONTINUE TO SHAKE IT DIES OUT VERY RAPIDLY.
THIS LIGHT MAY POSSIBLY COME IN HANDY DURING A HURRICANE POWER FAILURE BUT THERE ARE OTHER LED FLASHLIGHTS WITH BATTERIES THAT ARE SUPERIOR TO THIS ONE. THE POWER USED BY THESE LEDS IS LOW AND THE BATTERIES LAST A LONG TIME.

I have been purchasing a few of these self charging flashlights lately to find the best one.

This one puts out a a poor amount of light. It also does not retain its charge well.  You will have to shake it frequently to keep it charged.

I would say it is one of the worst ones I purchased

It holds my bike but seems unstable - I still can't figure out where all 6 straps go on my car, and the support rails tilt downward towards the rear instead of upwards.  Plus, probably the biggest concern - there is no means of strapping the bike to the rack (user must tie the bike down every time).  My bike hasn't fallen off though..

The light came without the batteries that were supposed to be included.  Batteries were very difficult to find and quite expensive.  Even with batteries the xenon light did not work.  So now I have a very expensive led flashlight with hard to replace batteries.  The case was nice however

If you want to picture yourself wrestling with poles, and pins while camping, then this is the item for you. The instructions are made only to confuse things more. It could be made so much more user friendly.

Not strong enough to hold even 2 gallons of water in a shower.  This is shown with a shower hanging in it but the only way it would hold it is empty.  Not usable as a shower.  Good if you are looking for privacy or changing room but not for a shower

I already have a good quality FitBall stability ball that I really like and only bought this set to get the DVD. I had planned to give the ball to a family member, but unfortunately it is of poor quality and not burst resistant, so it will probably just get thrown out.  The included pump is a piece of junk, so even if you do want to use the low quality ball, you'll need to find another way to inflate it.  Finally, Mindy Mylrea is a good instructor, but the music & sound quality were lacking and I ended up not liking the workout, so in the end I got rid of the dvd as well.

Now I am a firm believer that breakfast is a very important time in your day. Yesterday morning I was driving to the dentist's office when I realized that I had forgotten to eat. I started to have quite an anxiety attack, so I pulled over at the only available place. A Gas Station. Nothing really caught my eye as something I would like to put inside my body. Now this was no ordinary Gas Station. This was a special kind of one where they had hot food behind the counter, including supreme-pizza, chicken drum-sticks, and even breakfast-style food, like a little sausage-egg-buiscuit-combo-sandwich. Sure, the food smelled alright, but the thought sickened me that one of the mechanics or gas-pumpers may have had oil, grease, or even gasoline on their hands when preparing these dishes. While I was peering over the counter, trying to scope out just how filthy their hands were, something to my left caught my eye. 

It was a golden box of something called a "Powerbar". The name had me sold immediately (a food that creates power), and they were even individually sealed to prevent the repulsive hands of the workers from contaminating them. "I'm going to eat a POWERBAR" was the only thought on my mind as I purchased 4 of them on the spot. I hopped back in my VW Cabrio and sped off down Livernois towards the dentist's office. 

I unwrapped one of the Powerbars. It looked just like a normal candy-bar but the name told a different story. Just how much endurance and stamina would one of these provide, and for how long? What kind of advantages would I gain? I thought I had found my new favorite food. Finally, a food that defines Howard Tuttleman as a person. That is, until I took my first bite. 

My first bite literally took me 2 minutes to chew up enough to be able to work it down my throat. It was a tough rubbery nugget inside the chocolate that stretched out a bit like taffy. Every bite had the same grimy and bitter flavor, with an atrocious after-taste. My mouth felt like I had ingested a whole bottle of Elmer's glue, and every crevice between my teeth was gummed up with it. I reluctantly continued to eat the entire bar. My stomach began to feel as if I had eaten lead. I felt no extra power in my body. If anything, the Powerbar significantly weakened me by making me feel ill. I was convinced that I had simply picked a bad Powerbar, so I unwrapped another one to give it a second chance. By this time I was in the Dentist's parking lot. If I went in now, I could make the appointment on time, but I had to try for more Power. Big mistake. The second Powerbar was no different. It felt like the Powerbars were fighting my stomach. I finished the second Powerbar, feeling even worse. 

My third Powerbar however was the worst of the bunch. It was a different flavor, and I nearly threw-up. I felt 20 pounds heavier. My teeth and lips felt like I had been eating drywall, and were covered in chocolate and grimy nugget. I simply could NOT eat more than 2 bites of the fourth one, no matter how much I tried. It was time to go inside. 

My dentist was a little ticked-off that I was late, and got really annoyed about all of the Powerbar remains stuck in my teeth. Apparently I wasn't supposed to eat for a while before my appointment. I felt sick for the rest of the day. I gave my dog (Morris) the rest of the 4th Powerbar to see if it would work on a dog, but it just made his butt really powerful that night and was a real pain to clean up after. Please beware, the name of this product is deceptive, unless it is supposed to mean that the Powerbar ITSELF is powerful, and will overpower YOU. Later.

I am disappointed with this product as I thought I was ordering the stretchout strap which is all nylon and very durable which I give to my patients. This one is made of nylon and elastic. The stitching broke within 2 days of minimal use. The elastic may be more comfortable on the hands but the stitching is poor quality and just fell apart. Go with the Stretch Out Strap which I have been very pleased with

how can this table be used with FACE HOLE?
either -- 
1) use no sheets, ie client lies directly on vinyl, 
  or 
2) fitted sheet covers hole, ie client cannot breathe.
Neither of these 2 options is even remotely acceptable

We have in the past owned an In Step single jogger.  It wasn't perfect but it certainly met our needs.  It always needed to be tipped back to change direction and it rusted a little because we left it outside.  If we had stayed as an only child family it would have continued working but with the addition of another baby we decided to sell it.  After being in transition for over a year and now that the weather is warming up we decided to get a double jogger for strolling.  We purchased the In Step Run Around LTD 2 Jogging Stroller in hopes it would meet our new needs.  The problems of the single stroller seemed compounded in the double stroller.  My husband had no problem getting it together but complained about the cheap caliper style break... it doesn't stop the stroller and barely even slows it down.  It took him the same amount of time to work on the break as it took him to assemble the whole jogger.  After that we placed our three year old and our 18 month old in it for a test ride.  When placing them in we encountered our next problem... the seats even at the highest point are super reclined.  They wanted no part of laying back but instead were both utterly thrilled to sit far forward and mess with each other. As for the straps a six inch long safety label sewn to the webbing made it almost impossible to thread them through the front buckle. So off we set on our test drive.  It was really hard to push and almost impossible to turn.  After a while we figured out that letting the kids sit so far forward threw off the balance of the whole jogger.  The only way to make it partially work was to let out both seats to the fully reclined position, criss-cross the shoulder straps and constantly yell "Stay down kids...if you sit up one more time I'm going to sit in it and make you push me!"  Well we got home from our test run and my husband pulled out the cardboard box and with a resigned air began the job of taking it apart.  I don't recommend this item.  In all honesty our Radio Flyer Pathfinder Wagon does the job more effectivel

We know strollers!!  This is our 5th stroller over 4 kids.  We decided to try a dually.

Pros:
Plenty of room for 2 children both about 25 pounds.  "Cute"

CONS:
We're reviewing what we consider to be an expensive stroller.  In our opinion the added expense shouldn't equal just an extra seat, but better design and higher quality.

1)  While the dimensions are listed in the description, the relative size to every day objects are not discussed.  Objects, like say, doors.  This stroller won't fit through 90% of the doors in the world.  You basically had better only expect that it go through the front door of your house or plan on Parking it in the garage next to your suburban.  The doorway must be a 3'0 door (36  inches wide).  That's usually only your front door.    Forget about pushing into or out of any interior doorways which are generally much smaller.
2)  The straps are awful.  Again, our 4th stroller.  Worse one of all.  Incredibly, incredibly difficult to use.  I'm actually flabergasted at how difficult the straps are.  Despite having tightened them up as tight as possible, the two year old was out in under 10 minutes (once she decided to be out).
3)  Impossible to allow the children to sit up.  Again, adjusting the straps to the utmost, the angle of the backrest remains extremly steep.  Perhaps to counter balance the lack of effective straps?
4)  Hand brake is setup for the left hand.  Appears to be reversible if you want to work on it.
5)  Hood can not be lowered to cover front of children.  If say, you are walking into the sun (morn or evening), the kids are completely exposed.

Conclusion:
Very frustrating buy.  Wouldn't recommend it at all

This was one of our worst purchases. Rental gear that we have used on previous vacations works better! The snorkle and mask were constant problems, leaking, filling with water, etc. We had to stop snorkling every few minutes and finally just gave up.

the jacket works well for shedding water which isn't really losing positive weight. the pants rip during the first work out. i've purchased two of these hoping in good faith that the pants woouldn't rip. but they did. save your money unless you just want to jacket.

The suit will make you sweat if that's what you are looking to do.  I had rivers running out of my sleeves and pant legs, but the pants tore within weeks on the inside seam.  I was using the suit about 5 times a week with a vigorous treadmill routine.  It will likely last longer and be fine for occasional recreational uses, but buy something more substantial for a serious workout.  You truly do get what you pay for

 I received the exercise bike, put it together as soon as I got it,  and started using it. Just looking at it I had second thoughts about buying it. Ten minutes later it broke. Some part in this cheaply made product broke on the inside. I contacted the guys who sold this to me to get my money back but they never got back to me.
 One more thing. Even if it hadn't broken, the resistance setting on this thing is horrible. You get absolutely no resistance on it. That means no workout

Received the bike in our office as a possible incentive for our wellness program and no one was able to use it.  You can't get it to pedal.  The cheaper way is not the way to go on this type of bike.  You need a heavier base and very smooth cycling.  This model runs on a fabric type band on the inside. MADE VERY CHEAP.  I DON'T RECOMMEND

This wasn't actually a card game. It was more of a book of 88 tear out sheets with one game each. They is no way that this can be played as a card game. The box doesn't even indicate that it's a card game. I thought this would be a fun card game for my husband & daughter to play together. You can purchase magazines with more games for less price. I wouldn't recommend this product unless you would like an overpriced book of sudoku games. I'm returning it & buying an electronic version for husbands PDA. The price is about the same.

I bought this for my 5  year old daughter and we tried to take very good care of it.  Within a few days of careful use, one of the latches bent, a hinge broke off and a piece of the edge came unglued.  It is a great idea, but needs better construction.  On a positive note, my daughter loved it and would have spent hours drawing and creating with the tools inside if I let her.  However, I had to take the box away so further damage does not occur before I can fix it.  The drawers work fine.  The problem is with the two doors on top that flip out.  Note about drawers; Little plastic door knobs pop out.  Need to be glued in.

My daughter has an earlier version that the one shown so it is possible they have addressed some of these issues:

1) most games have a 1 minute time out which is really frustrating for my kids

2) "Oh that's not so good" - If I hear Barbie say that one more time I may just throw this thing out the nearest window.  My daughter will get a score in a game she feels really good about and barbie says, "Oh that's not so good, but you'll be better with a bit more practice"  This has broken my daughter down into tears more than once.

3) There are no parental controls.  I wanted to turn off or lengthen the timer.  I expected those sorts of features from Oregon Scientific.  

Right now the most fun thing my kids do with it is play the Flower Fun game (like hangman) and type in "ICUP"

If you are looking at a newer version of this I would strongly recommend playing with a demo for a few minutes to check it out

My daughter received this as a gift & we all found it extremely difficult to use.  I was not able to play most of the activities on the screens without first getting the handbook out & doing step by step which was still not very easy to figure out.  It was not at all easy for a child to enjoy.  There were very few activities my 6 year old daughter was able to understand & play. It is too advanced & difficult to use for the ages listed.  The screen on the monitor was low graphics & poor lighting quality as well.  This is a very expensive mistake that provided no benefit or fun to my daughter

I am the mother of two elementary aged children who love art projects.  This was a Christmas gift and I was never so disappointed in the quality of this item.  It arrived with crayons broken and the ones that weren't, you couldn't even use on paper.  The markers are dry and caps don't stay on.  This is a terrible product and the price is ridiculous!!!

The case is a CHEAPLY made box of wood that did not even survive shipping.  The materials contained inside are poor quality.  The rating does not deserve one star.

I returned it due to the damage sustained in shipping, but it would have been returned regardless because it is GARBAGE!

Yum...play food! This is a great set. I will buy it as soon as I find it. This is a great set! Lots of cans (good for storage), ice cream, boxed treats, cookies, (yummy), and of course, much more. And who could resist the spaghetti with meatballs? And is that chocolate chips on the ice cream? Oh my gosh, it's better than I thought.
You might think that to have a good time, your child needs 40 dollar Melissa and Doug wooden play food with real cutting noises and a Fisher Price 100 dollar kitchen for imaginative play. Bullpies, I say. I have tons of dollar-store food. I have ultra-realistic foam food from a kitchen set I got. I prefer the dollar store food. Dollar store food is better because it has more in one package, looks real, is cheap, pretty durable, and looks nice. I have a really silly play food set that came with a stovetop (small, but the knobs turn!), a pink and purple propane tank, a can of "barracuda" (seriously), and a can of "barracuda hash" which included barracuda, ham and eggs, chicken, turkey, potpie, and more eggs. But the logo has spam and a hotdog, and the front of it has beans, turkey, fish, sausage, and lots of weird meat. But it says "Eatable, 100% dainty, Present!, Daintiness, Dainty". Just wanted to let you know. 
So, bottom line is, dollar store play food is much better than you think it is. It comes with lots of things that the expensive companies would never have dreamed of

It seems like a nice complete set of playfood, except that the boxes are really flimsy cardboard, and I've thrown most of them out already.  It doesn't take much to crush them.  There are much nicer sets out there, and there are separate pieces sold on ebay, that are probably used but will stand the test of your kids much better.  Not worth the money

I was really excited about this toy because it was a stacking and sorting toy in one. And I love Laugh and Learn toys. I got it for my daughter for christmas when she was 16 months old. She never liked it. I kept it out and encouraged her to play with it, but she just really didn't get into it. Also, there is a sticker that goes on the bottom of the top pot so you can see the shapes through the holes on the lid, and the sticker shapes don't match the holes! Unfortunately, this toy was a big let down.

I was so excited when I ordered my Star Wars Holographic Emperor figure. I'd been waiting for this exclusive figure be available for weeks!! When I got home today, the box with the Amazon logo was on my doorstep. Upon opening the box, I was completely disappointed to find that the Emperor figure I'd been waiting for was damaged since it was jammed into the box so that the backing card was crushed. The people packing this stuff are half-wits!! Anybody with a brain would know better than to  cram something into a box like that!! They should be ashamed of their service & to all you collectors out there....BEWARE!!

This looks like such a great toy, and the packaging is really impressive, but don't be fooled like we were. I assumed that by paying close to 25 dollars it would be somewhat durable-just reasonable durability-I don't expect much from plastic toys...but this is really really bad. You might also think that paying that much would give you things like closable doors...you know, 99 cent matchbox cars' doors stay closed, but the space shuttle's doors don't-which limit it's "fun" factor. The "movable arm" is just a free floating plastic stick that simply is stuck into a hole..It doesn't even stay in. The "launch pad" and the fuel tank/boosters are down right horrible. They don't connect to the shuttle, which was disapointed all of us, especially my son. And it is so cheaply made, I really can't believe that it wasn't bought from the dollar store. My son was so excited for this set. But after playing with it for just a few minutes he hasn't gotten it out again. I would definately NOT recommend this

My 2 year old son loves to "cook" and to serve Mommy and Daddy meals from his kitchen.  My only complaint is that it falls over easily and it seems we are often picking it up off the floor.  It isn't very sturdy, but I'm not unhappy with this purchase

This game is for people to play if they're drunk or mindless...or in some cases both....it's completely pointless and uninteresting...if ur just going to play bunco to see if u can get 21 snake eyes you either love to waste time or are just stupid...sorry but i mean think about it?...why PAY MONEY for this when i can JUST USE DICE from OTHER MORE INTERESTING board games I already own? DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
~*Even if you manage to make the game interesting by being creative and thinking a little...you still shouldn't buy it...b/c like i said before JUST USE DICE FROM OTHER BOARD GAMES YOU ALREADY OWN!

My twin sons got this for christmas when they were 3.  They loved it!!!  The dog is so cuddly and cute.  They loved playing pretend with the accessories.  My only complaint is that within a day the latch was falling off, the syringe was coming apart, and the brush had lost a couple of bristles.  The boys had not played rough with it, it just wasn't the quality that I had hoped for.  It is a real favorite of theirs, I am just afraid that it won't last as long as their imaginations.  I think that with a few improvements it will be a fantastic toy.  A real winner for young children in the hospital.

I bought this for my daughter for her 11th birthday.  After playing the game once, she asked me if I could take it back.  She said that the game was boring because it was so limited as far as what you could do in the game.  My daughter has always played a lot of "simulated life" video games (i.e., the Sims, Animal Crossing) and online games (i.e, club penguin).  I suspect this is why she found this game limiting.  Other games that she has played portray a more intricate "life" and therefore draw the player in to a greater degree.  My advice would be to consider what your daughter is used to before buying this.  If your daughter has no experience in these types of games, this game will probably be fine.  However if your daughter has previously played simulated life games, she will probably find this one lacking.

I bought this for my nine year old daughter.  The game in theory is great, but ours does not work right, and the company is not real great to deal with.  I am still trying to get a replacement.  If the game worked properly, I would rate it 5 stars, easily.  Even my thirteen year old daughter loves it

We were excited to give this to our 5 year old for his birthday.  After opening he loved the design and having his own cool looking notebook computer and was very excitied.  However the screen is very disappointing.  I can't even rate the games because overall I simply just can't see what is on it.  The product is relatively useless in a dark environment and dissapointing.  I should have gone to a toys r us and actually compared the product to other simular products.  I would suggest anyone do the same prior to buying it

I bought this game for my new family for Christmas.  This is not at all the Game of Life that I remember playing for countless hours as a child.  First of all, my old game had all of the mountains, houses, and spinner permenantly attached to the game board.  With the new version, all of these things have to be attached with each setup, which takes about 10-15 minutes and they are easily knocked off the board.  Also, the spinner is hard to spin and frequently comes off of its pivot.  The cars are less sturdy and the people pegs do not stay in the car so you are constantly having to put the people back in the car.  Finally, the rules of the game have gotten more complicated and yet the meaning of the game has become more trivial.  I think I will put this in the top of a closet or in a yard sale and go find my old version of the game to play in the future

We were very disappointed in this toy.  It does not spin fast enough to make the paint spray evenly over the cardboard.  My older children had a spin art toy that was great.  It made the most spectacular designs. This is not worth the effort or money

This is more of a costume item for an adult or older child than a toy for a young child.  There are only two working buttons, one to open the visor and one that repeats a single message through a crackly speaker.  There is some padding on the top, but not enough.  The manufacturer acknowleges this by including a note suggesting that more padding be added.  Overall not a good value at all for the price.

I was really excited about this toy because it was a stacking and sorting toy in one. And I love Laugh and Learn toys. I got it for my daughter for christmas when she was 16 months old. She never liked it. I kept it out and encouraged her to play with it, but she just really didn't get into it. Also, there is a sticker that goes on the bottom of the top pot so you can see the shapes through the holes on the lid, and the sticker shapes don't match the holes! Unfortunately, this toy was a big let down.

My daughter received this as a gift & we all found it extremely difficult to use.  I was not able to play most of the activities on the screens without first getting the handbook out & doing step by step which was still not very easy to figure out.  It was not at all easy for a child to enjoy.  There were very few activities my 6 year old daughter was able to understand & play. It is too advanced & difficult to use for the ages listed.  The screen on the monitor was low graphics & poor lighting quality as well.  This is a very expensive mistake that provided no benefit or fun to my daughter

Great concept, but bad design. Both of my children have had one for a year. Due to the discomfort, they never use it! It needs to recline back further and the plastic is slippery making it hard to sit without slipping around

I bought this Basketball hoop for my son who was two and LOVED to shoot hoops.  Great height for a small kid, but difficult to adjust, latch always got stuck. Also, after a few months, the latch broke right off.  Now I have a hoop that is too low for the basketball to be any fun for my son.  Now it is just a $30 peice of trash

Yum...play food! This is a great set. I will buy it as soon as I find it. This is a great set! Lots of cans (good for storage), ice cream, boxed treats, cookies, (yummy), and of course, much more. And who could resist the spaghetti with meatballs? And is that chocolate chips on the ice cream? Oh my gosh, it's better than I thought.
You might think that to have a good time, your child needs 40 dollar Melissa and Doug wooden play food with real cutting noises and a Fisher Price 100 dollar kitchen for imaginative play. Bullpies, I say. I have tons of dollar-store food. I have ultra-realistic foam food from a kitchen set I got. I prefer the dollar store food. Dollar store food is better because it has more in one package, looks real, is cheap, pretty durable, and looks nice. I have a really silly play food set that came with a stovetop (small, but the knobs turn!), a pink and purple propane tank, a can of "barracuda" (seriously), and a can of "barracuda hash" which included barracuda, ham and eggs, chicken, turkey, potpie, and more eggs. But the logo has spam and a hotdog, and the front of it has beans, turkey, fish, sausage, and lots of weird meat. But it says "Eatable, 100% dainty, Present!, Daintiness, Dainty". Just wanted to let you know. 
So, bottom line is, dollar store play food is much better than you think it is. It comes with lots of things that the expensive companies would never have dreamed of

It seems like a nice complete set of playfood, except that the boxes are really flimsy cardboard, and I've thrown most of them out already.  It doesn't take much to crush them.  There are much nicer sets out there, and there are separate pieces sold on ebay, that are probably used but will stand the test of your kids much better.  Not worth the money

My 2 1/2 yr old son actually loves this product but he loves to take it apart as well.  We tighten the little colored pegs and a few weeks later he's taking them off again.  So far he's brought me pretty much everything that can come off including bolts with small washers.  Thank goodness he's past the stage of sticking everything in his mouth.  Also like everyone else we've had the same problem with the chalk board scratching just from writing on it with chalk.  I've always liked the Melissa and Doug products we've purchased but I wouldn't reccomend this easel at all

I purchased this coffee maker for my 3 yr. old son who loves to role play with the real coffee maker we have.  He was very excited about having his "own" coffee maker, however after only a few days it quit working.  The lights and sound still work but the water won't run anymore, he was very disappointed as this was his favorite part of the toy.  He still enjoys playing with the coffee maker so I will probably not return it because I think it would just break again and he has already accepted the fact that the water doesn't work!

When i first got it i was sooo excited! But when i opened it, it had no instructions. even the 10 things to do with it didnt explain how to work everything. sure it was fun at first but then i realized, "how am i supposed to do anyhting?" the semi worst part was the stuff stunk. i got really nauseous when i got a wift of it. now i can usually handle smells but this was the worst! I got dizzy and almost through up! I wish i could have soaked everything in like bleach or sumthin just to get rid of the stench! I had to clean it too! i kept pointing my nose in the other direction and walking away for fresh air! I would not personally reccomend this. i ahve not been able to REALLY use it!! I dont no if directions was supposed to come w/ it or what but i can tell you that i was NOT pleased!

I was rather disappointed with both Doll TV and the item.  The coin looks like it was made of cheap plastic.  I have toddler toys made of the same material.  The packaging is also very cheap and childish for a limited edition collectible.  

I was certainly expecting a lot more for a limited edition replica which costs $25.00.  

When I contaced Doll TV to discuss the item, I was told that this was "an exact prop replica of the coin necklace worn in the movie" and that they would refund my shipping costs if I removed my comments.  I didn't even pay for shipping!

This is a very cheaply made reproduction of Malfoy's wand.  Whether you buy it or not probably depends on who it's for.  It would be great for a very small kid who will lose or break it, as it's cheap and made of plastic.  However for anyone else who craes about detail and feel, you might as well be waving around a wooden dowel

I got this puzzle for my three children (age 5, 4, and 2) and within a day my 2 year old had chewed off enough of the little black rubber pieces that the toy no longer worked.  It requires two of them for the vehicles to make sounds, so removing one means it doesn't work.  The pieces are small enough that I wasn't very worried about choking, but why buy a toy which makes you worry?  We were really disappointed.

I am now the laughing stock of my friends, why because I payed money for the lamest excuse of a 8 bit console tv plug and play ever.  My atari plug and play has better graphics and feel than this.  There are bars that have the projected GTEE screen that makes the game all most real I feel my little tv had to much resolution for this toy making it feel not so real in fact in two words "it sucks".

The batmobile itself is nice and stylish for a boy who adores batman. But this same boy gets extremely frustrated trying to shoot the coin shaped projectile that it comes with. You have to insert it "just-so" to get it to shoot when you press the button and my son doesn't always do it, then I have to get a butter knife and pry it out so I can put it in for him. For 10 dollars it's worth it, so long as your child doesn't absolutely want a shooting batmobile. 

PS. My sister bought the same one for her son this Christmas and is having the same problem, so I do not think it is unique to mine

I don't know if we got some old box left over, or what.
Magnets are so weak, that kids can't make anything vertical.
They just collapse, and slide.
If I knew of course I wouldn't have purchased.
I got rid of the box, so I couldn't even return it.
OVER PRICED BIG TIME!!

This product reminds me of thick slightly mushy sand that you would play with at the beach except it comes in colors.  Playdough is much easier to work with if you want to build items/objects/shapes.  My daughter will play with playdough for hours but with this product, she lost interest after 10 minutes

My son kept seeing the commercials for this doll and he wanted it so badly.  Talked about it for a month so we got it for him.  He was super excited when he got and and the thing didn't work.  It just randomly gives clues that confused my son the point of tears. He was so confused it would tell him that he was close to it, then say he was no where near it.  Then when he was standing next to it, it said he was no where near it. He was so disappointed.  He thought the toy would be able to play hide n seek with him.  We followed the directs and helped him play with it.  He's 4. ( He wasn't running around like crazy like another person mentioned was why it doesn't work for some kids.) I think this is a terrible toy and Hayley's now in the trash.  She's too cheap and junky looking to even save for my daughter as a regular doll to play with

Not only did this phone not work, but the screen was really quite tiring on my eyes. The only ringtone that it had was a sound like beads being shaken up. The flashing light was distracting, and its features were extraordinarily limited! The camera option didn't work at all, and where the heck was the texting??? My parents bought this phone for me for my birthday, and it really made me mad!! I can see that this might be a good starter phone, but you can only get 0 calls froim it, and really limited reception in the mountains. Switch to a Razr as soon as possible

My daughter just about flipped when she received this toy as a birthday gift!  So immediately after the party, my husband went aboutputting it together.  My five year old played with this for all of about 30 seconds before a piece came off.  We've had it for about two weeks now, and EVERY time you touch this thing, some peice comes off.  No one plays with it.  It's just too much of a hassle to keep together.   My advice - but something else

My daughter really wanted the Cloud Kingdom for Christmas.  As soon as I saw the quality of it, I should have returned it but I knew it would break her heart.  It takes up a lot of room and does not fold for storage like most Barbie houses.  My daughter is very frustrated with it because the pieces do not stay together, so she hardly plays with it.  This toy is definately not worth the money.  I wish had read the reviews on this toy so could have bought her something that she could actually enjoy

Bought this for daughter for Christmas, and when I opened the box and saw the cardboard backing, debated on returning it. But they love the Pegasus Barbies, so figured okay, let's try it out! Is really beautiful when all put together, and my daughter LOVES it! But, that stupid cardboard backing. Nope, no way does it stay on at all. Am going to tape it to the wall behind the playset, and it will be fine. Right now is just standing up behind the set. Really, couldn't they have made a plastic piece with a big sticker with clouds/pegasus horses on it that attached to the back?  
When assembled, the whole thing will fall apart if you literally move it a couple inches.  My 3-year old daughter understands this, not to move it, and so far she has been fine with it. I showed her myself moving it and it falling apart, and said see, don't move it, okay!?  
But when it comes apart, is very easy to pop the sections back together - which in my house, the kids play with toys for a while, and then I like to put things away in the closet for a bit - which this I can easily break down some of it to store, and then in seconds have it snapped back together again to play with.
Yes, durability-wise is a piece of junk - but a beautiful piece of junk, and is worth it if your child loves the Pegasus Barbies

This was very cheaply made.  I was disappointed in it's quality.  Also, it comes apart constantly.  All my daughter has to do is barely touch it and it comes all apart.  I am going to try to glue the pieces in place so she can at least play with it.  We have many Barbie toys and this is by far the worst I have ever purchased.  Not to mention that is was expensive!  I expected much, much better quality from a Barbie product

I can't believe that they actually put the word 3-D on the box of this thing. How dare they advertise this as a fun and usefull learning experience. I wish I had read the reviews before I bought it. There is absolutely NO 3D value to this at all. They should have just made it plain 2D and then it would have been cool

The slides are awful and repetitive.My son had to keep asking me what they were pictures of...and I couldn't even answer him.I think the only thing he liked was when I turned the unit on without any slides and the light projected onto the ceiling.He thought that looked more like a moon that the acual slide did.Huge disappointment!!!And the base of the unit is worthless

First I would like to say that when I purchased this item it was advertised as the "Hobby" addition.  When I received it I didn't think it was the hobby set so I called amazon, the operator said she did not know about this product and provided me with the phone number to who sold it to me.  I called that number 3 times and left a message each time to please call me and I have yet to receive a phone call back.. When I gave this item to my husband for Christmas he confirmed my thought that it was not the "Hobby" addition.  I was not only upset that I did not get what I was looking for but that no one had returned my call

Don't be deceived by the box: Dread Pirate LOOKS like a really cool game with exceptionally made components, but it is DREADfully boring to play. The game is slow, tedious, and completely luck based, and simply no fun to play. You have been warned

Most of the other reviews for this toy are correct. when it works my kids love it. and it is pretty cool when it works. but it doesn't work very well very often. you need to find just the right car and everything needs to line up exactly. and even then the car crashes a lot. we have found one car (out of about 200) that works somewhat well. but even with this car the success rate is about 1 in 15. so, read the reviews and make your own judgements. personally, i'm glad this was a gift and i did not spend any money on it. my kids will still play with and enjoy it, but not as much as they would if it worked better

No wonder they are selling a 30 dollar toy for 5 bucks, it does not work and the quality is sub par.  I have three boys so we get alot of hotwheels toys and this one is the worst I have seen.  Do not take if it was free.  Garbarge and disappointment await.  I gave one star because you have to, but I would give negitive stars if I could

Leave this one "on the shelf"!! A "Hotwheels" product which doesn't come with "wheels"!????!!!  Who would have thought at $25.00 it doesn't come with a car and then they have the nerve to make it not work with other Hotwheels cars!! This is a very annoying junk toy which was such a disappointment to my son Christmas morning.  I would not have been so disatisfied had I shopped on Amazon and got it for the price being offered now--$5.00!!

Ho Ho Ho!!
My 6 year old has been asking for this toy for about 6 months now and today he finally got it. He's had it for about 5 hours now and is already tired of it. We've tried no less that 20 different cars and have yet been able to get it to work. The only thing it seems to do consistently is play that obnoxious sound over and over again (if you know how to turn the sound off, let me know. I'm ready to remove the batteries or clip the speaker wire).

Do not buy this toy. You'll be very disappointed in it.

The toy is a lure to a social networking website for little kids.  They play games against "friends", who are strangers on the web.  They "chat", but only with preapproved messages.  There is always a reason to come back to the website tomorrow and play some more.

I don't think teaching little kids to keep coming back to a website is particularly healthy.  I REALLY don't think teaching them to interact with strangers on the internet is a good lesson, no matter how sanitized the interactions might be on the Webkinz site.

My one year old and I love these blocks.  They are light, soft and provide endless opportunity for imagination.  However, they are extremely expensive and of inferior quality construction.  When we opened the box, we found  that several of the blocks were not cut along a straight edge making them  difficult to stack.  Also, several of the identical shape blocks were not  exactly the same size leading to stacking problems.  One of the blocks was  peeling in one corner.  These blocks are such a great idea I find it hard  to believe no other companies are making them

This is a piece of garbage. The balls deflate after a couple hours. The rim is so frail it won't hold up to much. My friend came over and yelled slam dunk threateningly at my hoop at which point I got in between them and the hoop and said this hoop was not for slam dunking. They correctly pointed out that it says "Slam Dunk Challenge" right on the back board. Don't do it - it will break. When I turned it on it kept score wrong and gave points for misses. So that function is worthless. The only reason I gave it two stars is that it looks kind of cool but will have to find a nerf ball.

We just bought this for our 3 year old.
I do not at all understand why it is labled for 5 and over!!
Cute game idea- 
But this was not well put together.
First I about died when I saw the super cheap, barely cardboard gameboard!!!!!!! It is a VERY small board, set up like a 4 piece puzzle, that I predict will barely stay together after a few plays.  
the jewelery, subpar.  the crown and rings are OK, the rest very cheap and plain.  But is serves it purpose just fine :).  
I give this low marks for educational and durablity.
BUT the jewlery box and spinner are a nice & durable!! If they put the same effort into the WHOLE game it may be worth buying.
My daughter DID enjoy dressing up and playing a game together so that salvaged a star for the game.

This puzzle (also known as Rubik's Revenge) is good fun - and because it has another layer of movement, it is much more likely to fall apart than the 3x3x3 cube. However, the puzzle of reassembly is also quite fun - and requires no force! A clue to reassembly - make sure that the last two pieces are the same colour edge pieces - and they will (very gently) snap into place.  A second clue: only the centre pieces (four flats pieces on each side) fit into the grooves of the ball - be gentle, and your cube will be as good as new. Start with the four centre pieces of one colour at the bottom - and build up the cube layer by layer. Remember! No force

I "played" with this at a specialty toy store and was pretty disappointed with it. I thought I wanted this for my son after seeing it online but I'm so glad we got to try it at a store first. My toddler showed almost no interest in it. It looked hard to use and not at all fun. However, it looked like it was well made of good wood and with good stains/paint and finishes.

We've had more fun with a plastic food container that I cut a square shape on the lid and my son fills it up with his wooden ABC blocks. BTW, you can  do the same using matchbox cars, Peek-A-Blocks, etc. Just use a different plastic food container (yogurt, sour cream, powdered drinks, etc.) for each shape.

I am not too happy with this item.  It has a handle, yet is heavy enough to hurt if a toddler drops it on their foot.  It is difficult to reach inside to get the shapes out.  And the vertical placement of the holes is difficult to use.  Other than that, it is attractive looking and constructed well

My son loved this tent.  He fit perfectly in it and it fits inside his crib so he can sleep in his tent.  My only beef with it is that somehow he's bent the frame of it so now it doesn't sit right on the floor.  Actually it doesn't sit on the floor at all because of where it's bent.  The tent would be better made if there were a floor to it and some support (similar to what keeps the top portion rigid) at the base of it to keep the "legs" (there aren't any but that's the best way to describe them) apart.  The tent would also be better constructed if it didn't have one continuous wire for the frame on each side.  If the wire gets bent there's no getting it back into its original shape, unless you take out the stitching (around the WHOLE tent frame) and repair it then restitch it, but who has that kind of time?  Overall it's a fun toy for a little one but not a well thought out build.  I'm glad we got it as a gift and it wasn't something we spent our money on

The fine print on the box tells you this is a "multi-terrain" vehicle, instead of an "all terrain" vehicle, this is because while they advertise it to go through sand, and grass, and mud, what they actually mean is that it will go through dry sand, such as you would find in a desert, dry grass, such as you would find on the african savannah, and dry mud, such as you would find in their fertile imagination.  Mine has shorted out and stopped working just going through dewey grass.

My son LOVES to "drive" cars. I saw this and thought he would love it. It is totally unrealistic, doesnt make much noise (which for some parents that would be a +, but in this case its not) and it is not entertaining at all. Paid entirely tooooo much money for something that he will not play with at all. I have tried letting some of my friends children play with it, and they dont seem to enjoy it either.

Purchased this item for traveling. Our son doesn't travel well. So we purchased this item for him and it doesn't strap on to the car seat like the picture shows. The straps are material and velcro on the ends. How do you attach these straps? So, now we just let him play with it being free. It doesn't attach

I am so glad we tested this product ahead of time. As a rule we test all battery opperated gifts before we wrap them, these walkie-talkies worked for ab out 10 'feet'... yes I said feet. We gave them to my 2 year old grandson to play with instead of his big brother who got a set of Midlands. Don't waste your money on these..

I wish I'd read the reviews before buying this product!  I would have saved us money and aggravation.  I bought these for my son's Christmas present this year.  He was really excited about playing with them with his sister.  The problem is, we haven't been able to find one single spot -- inside or out -- where we can get reception on both units!  Even when you can pick up one person on the handset, the sound is so staticky and crackly, that you can barely make out what the person is saying.  What's the point?  My kids got so frustrated in the first couple of days, that they dumped them in the toybox and haven't played with them since.  What an incredible waste of money and such a let down for the kids on Christmas. It's pretty rotten that National Geographic can conscience putting this piece of junk on the market.  Don't make my mistake.  Heed these reviews! This is a must-avoid product

My daughter got this for Christmas this year and almost immediately pulled off the top half of the Greg character on the keyboard.  In their defense, none of the other characters have come off so we will try to return this in case it was an isolated incident.  Other than that, she seems to like it.  She also received the accordian and LOVES it so I would recommend that over the keyboard

This tractor is advertised as a great back yard toy but is geared to high for younger children.  My son, who is almost 4 is a very stong bicycle pedaler but he can not make this tractor move across the lawn.  It would be great if you have a lot a pavement to ride it on, but if you planning on them ridding it through the back yard, forget it.  This is an on pavement toy only

This Sudoku YD-638 puzzle is very hard to use. And I think of my self as a computer geek. 

To make matters worse the instructions are very poor. They may make sense to someone who has used this for years, but not to a new user. 

Save you money to buy a different game.

I recently purchased the deluxe version of yahtzee after enjoying the regular game for many years.  I was impressed with the gold dice and the dice cup.  Everyone else in the house not playing really loves the padded cup.  I was disappointed in the dice tray.  It is very flimsy and not properly designed.  It should have a rotator and be made of more durable material.  Also, the score pads that came with the game do not have a place on the back to tally player totals.  I felt ripped off when I discovered this obvious mistake

This is fun and a good idea, but the quality of the stand and the plastic is very poor.  It fell apart the first time we had it up, and while you can put it back together, unless you want to be doing it every ten seconds, it isn't worth it.  The keyboard itself is fine. The microphone overpowers the keyboard music and has no volume on it, but the keyboard does.  The microphone stand is really cheap plastic and broke right away.  I would suggest buying a cheap keyboard and microphone and just using it on a table instead, or if you buy this product, don't expect to use the keyboard stand for long, but it can work without it

I bought this for my 2-yr-old at a rummage sale. He loves it! But it's very flimsy, the microphone gives constant feedback, adn the volume repeatedly resets to a dangerously loud level. It was worth the $6 I paid, but I wouldn't recommend buying it new

My son got this for his 4th birthday.  Moon Sand is a terrible toy--ugly and messy.  He seemed to enjoy playing with it (but no more than Play Doe), but the clean up is horrible.  The sand stuck to the treads of his shoes and was tracked throughout the house.

My daughter received this for her 4th birthday and I must say we were terribly disappointed!  This "sand" did nothing but make a huge mess of our play room.  There was dust everywhere and nothing the kids tried to make stayed together.  UGH!  As it is "sand," when it gets on the floor, there is no way to easily pick up the pieces except with a broom or vacuum.  We put it on newspaper to contain the mess, but boy was that a mistake.  Wet newspaper and dry sand............

We're going to take it back and get some good, old-fashioned Play-Doh instead

This product kept my 5-and-3-year-olds' attention for ten minutes, tops.  It does not look like the pictures in the ads.  It usually got stuck in the molds instead of sliding out effortlessly as it would appear in the ad.  It makes a mess, gets all over the place and truly does not seem to be much fun. It got put away in the cabinet and my childen never asked for it again.  My money is better spent on modeling clay or other arts & crafts types of activities

I did not buy this from Amazon but sought it out here so I could vent about this outrageous product (that's 'outrageous' in its traditional meaning, that it outrages me).

This is two packets of colored dust, approximately the consistency of unmixed plaster.  Empty the plastic bags and the colored dust flies everywhere, mold it in your hand and it retains its shape for a few seconds before blurring and falling apart.  My wife and I repeatedly checked the packaging to see if we should add water or do something else to make this usable but apparently not.

The claim on the package is that it "Molds like Dough," obviously intended to remind us of Play-doh, but Play-doh is a clay-like material that retains its shape and can, in fact, be molded.  This material -- again attempting to compare itself to Play-doh -- states that it won't dry out.  Of course not!  It's dust!  It can't dry out, there's nothing drier than dust.

In case you're wondering I have no connection to Play-doh or its makers (I don't even know who does make it), I'm simply the father of a 3-year old who uses Play-doh often and hoped this product might be a workable addition to our playtime.  Wrong

While my son enjoyed the illustrations anf fun content of the books in this set, I felt it was disappointing as a learning tool for beginning readers because it moves much too quickly.  The first book is just letters and letter sounds.  Very introductory.  The second book introduces three letter words right off with no transition at all like 2 letter blends.  That was ok to me since it was phonetic 3 letter words, but by page 2 we were already "leaping" to 4 and 5 letter words and by page 3 they were already introducing a sight word - "does" and a double consonant word - "cannot".  I thought the pace was frustrating for my son.  I was hoping/expecting a book devoted to just blends and/or 3 letter words.  Instead this program is organized by vowels with the letter a being introduced first.  I don't see that as a problem, but I was expecting more phonetic 3 letter words to start and introducing harder 4 and 5 letter words by maybe book 3 and sight words coming later, like maybe book 4.  Unfortunately, you can't see exactly what your getting until you open the box.
Nonetheless, the audio is entertaining for children with music and humor thrown in and the reward stickers, poster, and ribbon are a fun way to recognize your child's achievement.  The practice game is basically just like the Word Whammer Fridge Phonics product but with cards instead of magnets

just my opinion; but i have a hard time finding books to go with my 3yr old daughter's first leap pad.  she loves maurice sendak's where the wild things are and she loves many of the other books that go with the leap pad that is for 6mo-24mo age range.  i think they should have done a bit more research on which stories were associated with which leap pad system.  as for the pooh bear game; i agree; way too easy here; this would have been perfect for the leap pad made for younger children, and made a more challenging one for this level.  great idea; just not well put together

I had high hopes for this game, but played it with a friend last night and was appalled at the number of confusing questions and just plain incorrect answers.  For example, one question asks, "Which of these animals is not found exclusively in South America:  (a) chinchilla, (b) sloth, (c) guinea pig, (d) spring buck".  Ruling out zoos, my friend reasoned that since zillions of kids in the US have pet guinea pigs, the answer must be C.  Alas, no; the correct answer is "(d) spring buck" with no explanation.  Did they mean animals in their natural habitat?  We aren't sure.  The question is not clearly written.  Another question asks, "The word `berserk' is derived from:  (a) a Norse god; (b) the German for `crazy life', (c) a tropical plant".  I read this to my friend and said, "None of these is the right answer."  The word `berserk' comes from the Germanic branch of the language tree and means `bear-shirt'.  The game says the correct answer is "a Norse god.  In Norse mythology, the god `Berserker' always fought in a state of frenzy."  There is no such Norse god.  Who wrote these questions?  One of the aspects of trivia games that I enjoy is the prospect of learning something in the process of playing; this game concerns me because I do not know which answers are incorrect.  From a learning standpoint, the badly written questions and poorly researched answers make this a frustrating and intellectually dangerous game.

I got this for my eight year old. Unfornately I read the reviews on Amazon just before he opened it, not before I bought it.  This is a great idea very poorly implemented.

I am completely dissappointed, and if I had not bought it at a final clearance sale... would be bringing it back.  My son's previous method of holding a piece of paper over what he wants to copy and then taping them to a well lit window is much better and cheaper

After waiting for 1 month to get this toy I cannot tell you HOW disappointed my 7 year old daughter was when she got it. Absolutely this thing is a WASTE of money!

It is poorly designed and there is no way you can trace from it. The image is impossible to see with any amount of detail.

DO NOT BUY THIS TOY! I would give it zero stars if I could

The game of course is great fun, but the 3-D is not worth the extra cost.  The kids get distracted by the slides and ladders and don't play the game.  They fight over which direction the marble should move (and of course marbles get lost easily).  How to count the spaces is not obvious.  I would just get the good old classic game if I had it to buy over again.

When putting together the mobile section of this item, I was very disappointed in its flimsiness. It looks like just a few knocks will cause the screws to break from the plastic. 
When I turned it on I was disappointed a second time, this time by the irritating buzzing sound that the mobile makes as it rotates. It's so loud you can't hear the music, which is a shame because I'm sure my son would enjoy looking at the moving lights.
The third disappointment - the buttons are VERY hit-and-miss. Sometimes the music buttons don't work (the lullaby one worked eventually once I mashed it in really hard). That I could live with, but it's fiddling with the other controls that is really irritating. Control for music off, lights on/off and rotation on/off all seem to be tied up in two buttons. If you have the music and lights going, then turn on the rotation, the music and lights will go off as the rotation comes on. Then you have to press buttons in whatever order seems logical until you get them all going the way you want them. Please bear in mind I am NOT particularly daft - I managed to figure out my TIVO remote in a day or so - but the controls for this baby's musical mobile make no sense to me. I thought at first it was supposed to be deliberately challenging in order to stimulate 'baby's natural curiosity', but after two nights it really got on my nerves, and if I can't figure it out, I don't see how my one year old is supposed to. I can only think that there is something very screwed up with the circuitry in there. 
I'm not dismissing this item all together. The music is lovely - not too simplified and not too electronic-sounding. The Minute Waltz is particularly nice (I've noticed my son scans for it). The lights are lovely too, and do look pretty when they're moving if you can stand the buzzing. My son has come to depend on the music to amuse himself with as he falls asleep. BUT, if you buy it, I'd recommend testing the buttons and the motorized rotator before screwing the very flimsy mobile pieces together in case you need to return it.

This appealed to me since I would be able to use it longer than the standard mobile, but it ended up not working when we wanted it to anyways.  I liked to idea, but just doesn't work.  This mobile constantly stops working (before the 8 minutes are up)...it stops going round.  The music continues & the lights are still on, but the base stops rotating, it seems as though it always gets "stuck" and we have to push it to get "unstuck".  We've changed the battery and that doesn't seem to help as the base keeps getting stuck, I contacted Mattel to get a voucher since it's been more than 90 days since I bought this, can't return it in the store.  (It's kind of big and ugly too, didn't expect that from the picture.

My husband and I just bought the Family Feud 2nd Edition DVD TV Games.

I have to say we both LOVED this game when it was first on (and on GSN as repeats) and I like the computer version.

We played this once by ourself and a couple of times with friends and we all have found that this game was boring & as someone said they can't believe they put this out.

If you are going to get this game then buy the computer version.

You have 
5 rounds

Round #1
Round #2
Double Money Round
Triple Money Round
Fast Money Round

You have Team A and Team B.

If you get one wrong answer and you click wrong then it says go for steal.
HOWEVER, you only get one X.

Per Guide...IF an answer is revealed that Team A did not have written down, they press Wrong Answer button and pass the remote to Team B.
Team B now has the opportunity to steal the round.

So most of the game was passing the remote back and forth.

IF the steal answer matches any one of the remaining answers they steal the round (even if you-Team A had that written down) and takes the money for any answer the other team has answered correctly (even if they got 4 out of 5 and both Teams say have the same answer)

The game itself was simple and basic.
There was no real fun to it.

We tried to play it with others and they said afterwards that they found it boring and not all that fun.
One person said they would have more fun watching the game itself on TV over playing this version of the game.

You get two markers (red and blue) to write on the two wipe-clean score cards. The negative on this is that the markers do not write all that good on these cards even though they were meant to.

Another thing is that the same game will come up more than once.
We had the same question and answer come up even though we only played twice.

This is the 3rd or 4th DVD game we have been given or bought.
This is the only one where we disliked it so much after playing it a couple of times that we are giving it away as we will not be playing it again

This is the first time I'm writing a review of anything on Amazon.com, but I need to warn people about this game.  It would be great except for 2 problems:
1.  It skip excessively.
2.  There is no way to easily skip past games that you've played.  So once you've taken out that DVD, put it back in and you'll recognize the questions -- you've answered them already!

Not recommended.

If I could give it negative stars, I would.  However, Amazon makes you give it at least 1

My son was excited to get this for christmas.  After we opened it and put it together it just never worked the way it was designed.  The arrows launcher never held the arrows.  As soon as you tried to load them they would fly out.  The shuriken launcer was cumbersome and difficult to use.  He pretty much gave up on it after a few days and now it's gathering dust in our closet.

This toy barely gets used in our house. It has a very low to the floor design, my 18 month old daughter has to hunch just to play with it. The sounds and characters are cute, but clunky and not very realistic. I am very dissatisfied with this purchase, not worth the investment. If you are looking for a fisher price doll house for your youngster, I would suggest checking out: Fisher Price - My First Dollhouse. It has a higher design with more realistic characters, not so clunky. I wish we would have purchased this one instead

I just recieved a Fisher Price magazine in the mail and thought this product would be a nice Christmas gift.  I was thinking that Amazon would have a good price, but they are almost double what Fisher price is asking.  If you go to Fisher Price's website this item is only $33.00 + $7.95 shipping and handling.

I just ordered the world of little people sweet sounds from amazon. I haven't received it yet. I paid $200.00 for it. Now I can see it's selling for $139.00. I've also seen it for $32.00. What's going on. Is there a difference in sets? I'm not sure, but I think I acted too quickly. Can anyone tell me if there is a difference in the doll houses? Did I make a big mistake

I got the baby alive Hispanic doll for my daughter for Christmas. I opted for the Hispanic doll becuase I thought my daughter would learn a bit of the two languages as we speak French primarily in our home.I must have received a broken doll because our doll is nothing like the description. She does not speak English at all...you can press her bracelet a million times and no English. And when she does speak, her English is slurred and unintelligible. We have contacted Amazon several times and have had them decline a return. After 2 months, we are still wiating for her to eat and fall asleep. VERY DISAPPOINTING! Would not recommend at all!!! The reason that this rating received one star is because my daughter loves her death even though she does nothing

I bought this table for my almost 8 month old who is starting to pull up on things.  I thought this would be safe for her to learn to stand with because it has hand grippers along the sides of the table (just for that purpose) and is recommended for ages 6 months+.  All of the fun shapes, colors, and sounds immediately caught her attention.  She cawled over to it and when she tried to pull herself up it fell over ontop of her.  She bumped her head and cried, but fortunately, wasn't hurt.  I put a rug under it thinking maybe that would help make it more stable, but as soon as she tried to pull up again (within 5 minutes of taking it out of the box) it fell over on her again.  The top of the table is very heavy, but the legs are not very sturdy, making it topheavy and easy to topple.  Needless to say, I took it back to the store.  
I would not recommend this toy unless you only wanted to take the legs off and use it on the floor, or if you have a toddler who is very steady at standing on his own.  Personally, I think the recommended age should be changed for older children or this toy should be recalled and the legs redesigned.

My 10-mo-old son showed no particular interest in this "table". I did not like it much either. Why would a 10-mo-old show any interest in table items that sing? I have left it without legs. Two minutes after I installed the legs my son nearly fell with the "table" on his face. Had to uninstall them. Not good for active infants. Also not very entertaining. Buy the one from Leapfrog but still be careful when you have installed the legs because they say that that one is higher than this (might have more balance though but I do not know for sure)

Our 7 yr old daughter was given this last Christmas.  It is awkward to use and the motor didn't seem to have the power needed to turn the wheel when the clay was on it.  She ended up using the clay and molding it by free hand.  It now sits in the corner of her activity table and isn't used at all.

As in my title I have mixed feelings about this toy. My children both have the original color version of the VideNow. I thought I would upgrade them to the newer version. They have a cheap feel to them and don't seem to work very well. In fact one is going back to the store next week for a trade in. There is a lock botton that freezes the bottons so you can't accidently turn off while watching. But it seems like the buttons freeze up on their own quite often. I can see why the batteries go dead quickly because if a child can't turn off the unit it just gets left on! I am very dissapointed in this. The kids really enjoyed their Color versions and I feel I shouldn't have gone to the extra expense to upgrade them. However, even with it's faults my kids still enjoy them. My kids don't watch a lot of TV and prefer the shorter pvds to the long Dvds. I prefer that too. That way I can say they can watch one show and know they won't be watching for an hour or more. If you are a parent thinking about purchassing one- keep you receipt in case you need to exchange and carefully think about how your kids will be using it. If your child is easily dissapointed by items that may not work properly this may not be the item for you

Please. These things SUCK. Oh, wow! Its got a 3 inch screen!! Big deal! My portable DVD player is 10.2 inches; almost tripple the size of this! The quality is pixely and crap, and you have to buy the stupid "Video Now" Pvds. $14 for, what? 6 episodes? Oh, thats so cool, as in not really. Trust me people. Stick to portably DVD player. Yes, they are very expensive, but they will last twice as long. If you want a really good DVD player, buy the 10.2 inch Insigna Portable DVD. Yeah, its $260, but it is worth every penny. So, all in, if you are gulliable, and like blowing your money on a device that is better left in the store, buy this! But, if you are like me, stick to DVD players.

This game is heavily developed based on the actual movie.  If you haven't seen the movie, and/or your kid was too young to understand the plot, then they might not get the game.  

Most of the adventures are based on the story plot.  A lot of the adventures are a bit dumb, like McQueen bumping alphabet tires into a truck, McQueen tipping over the tractors based on counting smoke rings, McQueen herding the tractors back into the pen, McQueen driving down a long road and picking up shapes, McQueen driving down a road looking for Mack based on memory, McQueen dodging the firetruck water blast, etc.  The only adventure I liked was the forklift picking up tire numbers (odd vs. even) and installing them on the race car.

Don't buy this game unless your kid is obsessed with Cars

I bought the race cars to go on the speed and go racetrack.  After shaking the cars, they do not even go around the racetrack once!! My boys still love the cars becasue of the way they look and the noise that they make. And boy do they make alot of noise! They love to push the cars around the racetrack.  It frustrates me becasue I bought several of these shake and go racecars that do not go around the track and use alot of batteries

I had a feeling that this toy would be trouble when I saw the delivery guy walking up to our front steps with a weird grin on his face.  Evidently, the box had been vrooming, vibrating and shrieking throughout his rounds, and he was only too glad to end his term as its temporary steward.  My two-year-old has largely lost interest in this toy; he doesn't mind the shaking and noise, but more often than not it just vrooms and then doesn't go anywhere.  My advice: buy Matchbox, or Hot Wheels...or something more reliable with volume control. This will probably be in our next load of donations...thrift shoppers beware.

HI.everyone gues what i went to toys r us and amazon.com and i saw these hamsters. i thaught they were just too tenderly sweet for me. so i asked my mum over like abillion times. Can i get this mom no she said.2 minutes later can i get this mom no she said AGAIN.then i really started begging her that she just suddenly agreeed. now just remember don't always beg your parents cause the secret is if you ask your parents once and they say no then be really good for about a week and then they might surprise you with you'r special tenderly sweet toy. so now remember i am and always will be raiting  5 stars. so just please try to test this. boys might even like it. if you listen to me and get it you can/could still return it okay BI FRIENDS!!!!!!!!!!
you really did me a fauvor

...doesn't make it a great toy. A lesson learned the hard way. This toy is unbelievably loud. So loud, my husband and I can't stand to be in the same room with our son when he's dancing (stomping) on it. So ridiculously loud, my son can't play with this toy inside at all anymore. Every time he moves, the songs start over. Grates on your nerves after the 5th or 6th stomp. What a disappointing toy. We've had it out of the box three or four times to play with. It is now hidden in the deepest darkest part of the hall closet until we make our next round of donations to Good Will. Save your money for one of the other good dance mat toys on the market. This one's a stinker

This toy is the most stupidest thing i have ever had. The only reason why i gave it a one is because you couldn't give it a zero. First of all this thing beeps every five seconds. I swear even when im sleeping this thing beeps. It wsn't always like that when i got it i would bring it to school then everyone started getting one even kindergarners had one then the princble banned them because one third grader lost hers. During class kids would ask me do you want to connect? Im just saying this is a toy for little ones. This toy can also get repetative i mean its a baby then it gets a tooth ache toddler teen adult old person. So parents if your thining about buying this toy for your children dont because in about a month and a half they would probably stop using it. So dont buy it

I couldn't agree more about this product. It's appalling how badly made it is. The concept is very cute - a toolbox that unfolds into bridges and roads for the small die-cast vehicles. My 2.5 year-old has a hard enough time dealing with frustration without this toy adding to it! The bridge on the right doesn't properly attach or stay up and the road pieces do not attach properly. It's also a battle to get the tool box to connect together. My son always wants to play with it, but I can't cope with his cries of frustration when it all falls apart. I think this toy will have to mysteriously "disappear" one night while he is sleeping. They should withdraw this rubbish from the market and refund us all our money!

I absolutely love this deck.  I bought this along with "Zombie Madness" and the "Warrior's Triumph" structure decks.  They all rock,  but this is my favorite.  And for the guy who gave the Winged Dragon Of Ra tip, on the bottom of the card it says "THIS CARD CANNOT BE USED IN A DUEL". So even if you happen to get one [which costs a LOT] you can't officially use it. Overall,  this deck is very cool.  I love Red Eyes Darkness dragon! 


P.S. For best results,  buy the Yu-Gi-Oh! deluxe pack for 20$.  It comes with "Dragon's Roar" and "Zombie Madness" plus two rare cards ["Rope Of Life" and "Armed Dragon LV7"]. Here's what they do:


Rope Of Life

PGD-105-Ultra Rare

This card can only be activated by discarding your entire hand when 1 of your own monsters is sent to the Graveyard as a result of battle. Special Summon the monster just sent to the Graveyard in face-up Attack or Defense Position, and increase its ATK by 800 points.

"Armed Dragon LV7"

 This card cannot be Normal Summoned or Set. This card cannot be Special Summoned except by the effect of "Armed Dragon LV5". Send 1 monster card from your hand to the Graveyard to destroy all face-up monsters on your opponent's side of the field with an ATK equal to or less than the ATK of the sent monster.



Add this the deck for an amazing combo!  Start off by setting a Masked Dragon card in defense mode.  When your opponent destroys it,  use its effect to summon "Armed Dragon LV3".  During your Standby Phase,  Send it to the graveyard to Special Summon "Armed Dragon LV5".  Then use it to attack your opponent's monster which is most likely destroyed.  Then when you end your turn use its effect to special summon "Armed Dragon LV7" from your hand OR deck!  You now have a 2800 atk points on the field!  Sweet!  And its effect is soooooooooo cool. I put the "Rope Of Life" card in my "Warrior's Triumph" structure deck.  It helps out a lot! I hope you will make the right choice in buting this deck or the more preferable deluxe pack.  Yu-Gi-Oh! Your Move

I purchased this item yesterday, also set it up as shown. There is a little plastic gray piece that sticks up and doesnt let the cars go through. We have yet also to get ONE car through. A huge disappointment to my son who was excited about it. But I called Mattel and they gave me a gift card for the amount i purchased it for. Great customer service. I think this product should be recalled because the cars do shoot back at you at an alarming speed. Hit my son in the head.

We bought this item for our son's birthday. We assembled it exactly as shown in the directions.  The cars do not launch properly into the loop - we have yet to have one car make it through the entire track. Also, when you place cars to "launch" and "crash" they shoot clear across the room. One knocked our daughter in the chest! 

Not worth what we spent on the item and we are finding ourselves increasingly dissappointed with Hot Wheels items.

I have been searching for the perfect handheld sudoku game and this is not it.  I found it very difficult to see the numbers without a backlight even with my reading glasses.  Also I would perfer a stylus pen instead of having to scroll around the screen to enter a number.  I do like the idea of being able to use a dry erase pen to mark off numbers, but I couldn't even see those.  Still searching

We gave this toy to our 4 year old son.  That was 1 1/2 years ago.  It worked at first, but the balls did not pop up high enough for him to hit.  After about 1 month, the balls did not pop up at all.  Little Tikes replaced it with a completely new toy.  Again, it worked for a few months, but now it does not work.  The beeps sound (a nice feature), but nothing happens.  My son has given up on the automatic feature and will sometimes use it as a t-ball stand.  Most of the balls are lost.  Thank goodness I only paid $10 for this on sale - but not even worth that much

Purchased five of these sets thinking they would be fun stocking stuffers.  Wanting to check out what I purchased, I opened one of the five.   The geodes are tiny (not as pictured).  It was like breaking open dirt-clods... that have a small empty space inside... but not crystals.  Maybe it was a "dud" box, but will probably be returning the other four.

Bought at Toys r Us for 8 year old. Had fun putting
it together, and like I said it Looks cool.

However, you barely touch it while playing with it,
and it falls apart. Even frustrating for a kid.

I would expect better quality for $40.
Probably will return

Here in America, Lindsay Lohan is what many call a conspiracy. Lindsay Lohan is NOT  a "beloved collector's item". She's a bulimic spoiled brat. 

She's also, weird. MyScene has made the biggest marketing mistake of their life. Lindsay Lohan went from cute child star to bulimic brat in a milisecond. She thinks she can sing, and she can't. She thinks she can do a romantic comedy, and she can't. (Just My Luck, was not "lucky")

I bet not even a million bought this doll from a cheap knock-off of the Barbie line.

You'd only buy your child this doll if you want them to idolize a young woman who has thrown her life away

Okay, the concept of this game cube is great, and believe me: you will spend many hours trying to solve this puzzle.
Now on to the reality...
I first tried this brain buster in the eighties when it came out. Upon its first release, the stickers stayed on, the plastic squares didn't break off, and it just seemed like a higher quality piece. I beleive the plastic might have been heavier.
But now, twenty years later, the stickers peal off, the squares pop out. JUNK, JUNK, JUNK!

If this was made in the USA it would now cost more than it does being manufactured over seas, however ...it wouldn't be junk.
You get what you pay for.

I had purchased two of these Smack and Yack cars for my grandson.  While wrapping them the night before I planned to give the gift, I discovered that they did not make noise as advertised.  If I had looked at them earlier, I would have returned them for a refund.  It's no fun to have grandchildren that are disappointed

I asked my sister to buy this bike for my daughter for xmas last year - she decided to buy another one for my nephew also since he is the same age as my daughter (2 yrs old at the time). She bought the two bikes at the same time, same model, same color, same store. My daughter, who is far more coordinated then my nephew, tips over very easy, my nephew seems to do fine. My daughter is taller and that may be where the difference lies. Perhaps the height of the child using the trike is what is causing the trike to tip easily. Not sure - but I know I regret that she ever got the bike -it was a total waste of money

I bought two of these trikes for my 19 month old twin sons.  Within the first 10 minutes of use, they both tipped over numerous times.  They tipped over when they were trying to use the pedals and also when they were just using their feet on the floor. Definitely not a sturdy trike.  My husband and I were very disappointed and returned them immediately.

In reading other reviews, I see that our experience with these trikes is not unique

This bike may be cute, but it tips over too easily.  My daughter was on it for 10 minutes and she tipped over several times, then would not go on it. I returned it to the store, after reading on this site that it is obviously a common problem with this bike.

I have a BIG Dora fan in my house & this was one of her first Dora dolls (last year). She played with it for the first day or two...its loud, very mechanical, not very appealing. The toy saw a rebirth in use when it was discovered that it she could make Dora dance & terrorize the puppy. The doll only does one dance, regardless of what skirt she has on now. From reading other reviews, if I pushed & held it while she was wearing it she might ballet, but not worth the hassle! Since then, my Dora lover has received various other Dora dolls, so we have a collection that sings, dances, speaks various languages, and the ONLY one she plays with regularly is the Dress Up Adventure Dora - she's more posable, does something other than sing, and you can change her outfits. Perfect for my almost 5 year old

Loud annoying and entertaining for only a day.  I got this doll because my 3 and 5 year olds, both "had to have it".  They watched it dance for about 30 minutes and that was the extent of the play with this doll.  It isn't a doll that they can use imagination with, snuggle with, or any other type of constructive play.  A Dora video would have been a better choice.  At least their attention would have been captured for the 30 minutes and then they would have watched it again later.  In order to get the skirt to stay on (to change the song she danced to) I had to push VERY hard.  My kids couldn't do it on their own

I wouldn't waste my time buying anything from this company. We purchased the Train table for a Christmas gift and while assembling it on Christmas eve there were quality issues. Several drilled holes were not drilled in the proper position and the table surface had several deep scratches. I called and e-mailed the company several times to try and obtain replacement parts and never got a response. Most companies want you to contact them when you need replacement parts rather than returning it to the store, but not KidKraft

My daughter loves the sticker maker but she used the cartridge in one day and still has plenty of stickers left to make and I can not find the refills anywhere.  They need to make the refills for these types of toys easier to get.  I am to hesitant to buy the bead maker now because of that and I know my daughter would like it but It's a waste if it's a one time use and upsets my daughter

This product is terrible. The very essence of Su Doku is logic & reasoning. This product leaves everything to guesswork. I returned it, ate the postage, & was happy to be rid of it! I then downloaded shareware from the Palm Store to my Palm Pilot for $10. Couldn't be happier

My kids were getting very frustrated with the connections of masts and hulls.  They are very poorly designed and "pressure" fit to a point where they easily pop off. Both boats - the Royal Dutchman and Black Pearl - have poor fitting. Compared to lego, the ability for parts to connect and stay connected is extremely poor.

I plan to write a letter to Mega Blocks about this quality issue

I could get the aircraft to pickup and eventually hover but there is no such thing as getting that thing to go in the direction you want it to. I put the aluminum weights on the nose to get it to move forward that way all I had to do was turn it in the direction I wanted it to go. It is very difficult and is no way as easy as it looks on TV. And I've practiced a lot

I purchased the Havoc Heli for my dad. He saw an ad for it on TV and wanted one, so I was excited that Amazon.com had it for a lower cost and free shipping. However, that was as far as the "good" went. My dad was disappointed to find out that not only could the Havoc Heli not pick up and fly with the accessories that came with it, but it had a difficult time flying without any "extra weight". This helicopter has no risk of creating any havoc. But, it does make a cute little paperweight.

The McQueen car went first. Motor sounds worked but no voice and rear wheel activation. This, after about two weeks of play. 
Then the King car stopped working. Same thing, no voice or rear wheel activation. The cars that came with the Shake 'N Go race track are holding up but go through the batterys. The cars have a tough plastic shell and alot of thought has gone into the details. One gets the impression of a quality toy when handeling it and they look good just sitting still. But, that is not what we get them for.

I feel like an idiot, maybe I didn't have all the parts or something but I tried and my husband tried and my neice tried and my friend tried and my stepson tried and NONE of us could figure out how to get this thing together.  

Since there were no instructions, that helped alot.  

There was a picture but the hoops that went over secured to nothing and fell on the kid, making it utterly useless.  Though there were little things that appeared to attach to something, they taunted us and we tried and tried to attach this here and that there and maybe that will work...it was ridiculous.  

We haven't had the issue with any other baby thing...not car seats, not the red wagon, not the baby gates, not the crib or the cradle...but this thing after several attempts we just took the hangdowns off and she played with those until the batteries died.  We sold it at a garage sale for a buck and felt like glad for it to be out of our lives and out of our closet

This item is cheap and I don't mean the price.  It will not stay together.  The plastic frames do not attach well to the mat because it is held with velcro that keeps coming undone.  The arched bars are not bent enough causing one side to pop up off the floor.  I tried bending them myself, but they always return to their original shape.  Pay the extra money and get a better mat

We just put the stupid thing together and put the batteries in and nothing worked.  The light would go on and off, but there were no sounds at all.  We made sure we had everything plugged in correctly, but it still wouldn't work.  After all the time of putting it together what a disappointment.  I will be calling Fisher Price tomorrow and seeing if they have any suggests and/or taking it back to Toyrus.

We founds missing parts and 2 side pieces were the same, when they should have been"a" and "D".  WE got 2 "D"  pieces.  Part "Q" was also missing

At first the case seemed like a good idea, but after the third use the zipper stopped working. Because the case does not stay open on its own, there is a tendency to push the case open and force the zipper backward and apart. After fixing it a couple of times, it is now permanently broken. Bad design. Perhaps Velcro would have been better here.

This is a very cute and realistic set.  The measurements are all accurate.  The whisk is very DANGEROUS though.  It is metal.  One of the "things" came out of the handle and stuck out like a weapon.  One of the kids could have been severely injured had I not found it and thrown it away.  If you buy this item, make sure get rid of the whisk!

I purchased this for my daughters 2nd birthday. Withing the first 5 minutes the back of the chair part for the high chair had broken off and would not stay on. The first time she went to take it in the bath Pooh's arm came off and will not go back on. I am just really disappointed that it wasn't anything as great as I thought it would be. I saw the it in the store and was excited that my daughter would love it, but sadly it was very depressing for both of us

I bought this kit solely for the prism to show my kids how the light split into a rainbow.  The prism is such poor quality plastic, that the light doesn't even go through it correctly.  I could have made a better prism in my oven with plastic pellets and a form.  The sides look like a cake top that fell, causing the light to not go through it correctly.  The rest of the kit sucks too.  I put batteries in the flashlight and the plastic of the flashlight cracked and crumbled in my hand!  The cardboard cutouts are ok... if you want to pay lots of bucks for cardboard cutouts and the included soda straw.

This stuff is greasy and hard to wipe off tables and fingers.  It's good for older kids who can keep their fingers on the paper but not good for little ones who smush their fingers into the wax and get it all under their finger nails on the table, chairs and walls.

Although Crayola is a wonderful brand, I was not impressed with their Color Wonder fingerpaints.  The time between when my children put it on the paper and the time it actually appears is too long for them, and they get frustrated.  It is very hard to keep their attention long enough to make an entire picture.  Also, it is not "mess free."  The paints are very greasy and you end up cleaning it off of everything they touch (other than paper) anyways.  I did not like how mushy the paint was...I am still finding globs of it everywhere

Looks great, but NOT worth the money.   My son begged for this toy - and it was a big dud.  Almost impossible to fly - I think once out of 50 tries were we successful.   Made out of flimsy material, it chipped and scraped right away.  

Do NOT buy this toy!!!!!

I was very unhappy with this product because the paint is chipping off the wood side-boards which is very dangerous for kids.  I was wondering if there was it possible for me to get new side boards for my grandson's wagon which I purchased for his 2nd birthday.  He is unable to play with the wagon because of the paint chipping off

After reading the reviews on this table we thought we would gamble. We were very disappointed.  The packaging arrived torn and open in several places. Only a few screws came with the table, not that this made much difference as there were table parts missing too. The parts that did arrive were chipped practically in every corner and the paint rubbed off. Amazon were efficient in having the item picked up for return and refund

I read all the negative reviews on this table and decided to go ahead and order hoping I would get lucky and not have all the problems the other customers had. DON'T DO IT! The table arrived poorly packaged and beat up just as the others here have described. One corner of the table top was bashed in, another piece of wood was split, the green paint from the table top rubbed off onto the white table leg, and edge of the other table leg was dented in revealing the plywood underneath the paint. This is a very CHEAP table - cheaply constructed of plywood. It is functional, but just not very attractive since it arrives already damaged. Just beware before you buy that you will more than likely be getting a banged up train table

As far as I know there is only one tempo and one type of dance sequence on this mat.  No matter how much we play around with the different buttons it does not do anything different.  This was a big request from my 6 year old daughter for Christmas and now she hardly plays with it.  It entertains our 15 month old twins more!  Resist any begging by your kids for this item and buy something else, a CD boombox maybe

We bought this for my son for Christmas, on the conditon that he never put fish in it, since the reviews said it killed fish.  That worked fine until he won a fish at the school carnival.  Of course it had to go in with the sharks.  So with freshly treated water and a prayer, we put the fish in.  The next day it was very listless and lying along the bottom.  After checking the reviews, I saw one where the person removed the fish and they recovered.  So we've taken the beta out and are waiting to see if it will survive.  I still would rate this aquarium 1 star for cool looks and lights, but it's very noisy and I believe it kills fish

Followed all directions, added fish, within hours the fish were "sleeping" on the bottom of the tank. Luckily they had not entered the never ending sleep so I took them out putting them in a bowl of water and after an hour they started getting better.  Changed the water in the tank this time using distilled water, added fish, 3 hours later they were lying motionless on the bottom.  took them out and put them in another bowl of water and they got better. Something is seriously wrong with this tank.  Bought regular plastic tank at the pet store added fish and guess what... they are doing great!  Do not put fish in the shark tank.  They will die

My 4 year son is learning about the fragility of life the hard way with this tank.
Two Goldfish, two flushes. If I take the struggling fish out of the tank and put it in a fish bowl it seems to come around, but they won't last 24 hours in this tank. I've followed the directions to a T, Adjusted the pH, tried lights on lights off, pump on pump off, even used bottled water, but the fish just do a slow fade when in the tank

I bought this toy for my shark-crazed 5 year-old... she was so stoked and we prepped the tank, added the recommended water chemicals and dropped in two small goldfish. Less than 24 hours later, they were dead. Repeat... 40 hours later... same story. We tried a single Betta, Frank, but less than 4 days later... he's dead. We don't know what it is. The water was tested, it's fine. We think it is the overall design of the tank, could the tight-fitting lid be responsible? Possibly ammonia by-product buildup from the fish? Who knows. But we have given up and are dumping this promising toy into the trash bin

I agree with the comments about the taste and size.  Personally I think someone should look into the false advertising.  On the preztel kit, which is also a "4 pack", you only get two pretzels.  One of the packs is salt and another is glaze.  Then you get two packs of some pretzel dough.  These pretzels are not much larger than the ones you get in a bag out of the vending machine.

Total rip-off.  Hasbro should be ashamed of its marketing staff

Horrible advertising on these packages.  It shows a huge delicious bowl of pasta when says 4 pack, but it only makes two "bowls" of pasta.  The servings are so tiny, that if you make both packets together, you maybe get a half a bowl of pasta.  Not to mention that it takes about 11-15 minutes to cook!  Pasta's so sticky you have to use no-stick spray.  The taste is so bad my son, who eats anything wouldn't touch it, and the sauce packet was hard as a rock, so it didn't mix up and left big chunks in the ketchup you have to add.  We tried the mac and cheese too, it takes 15 minutes to cook and again says 4 pack, but that's only 2 pastas and 2 cheeses.  Very expensive, hardly any food, and pretty nasty to eat.  They need to be alot more realistic on their packaging instead of trying to use false pictures and saying "4pack"  Eight thumbs down from this family

The go-cart is much smaller that it appeared to be. My 2 year old barely fits. These is no reverse and it is a sit in toy. So the child has to get completely out to turn around, or you have to follow them around. The steering column is not straight so the steering wheel has to be sideways to drive straight. All together it is not a very impressive to. My daughter enjoys it very much but I should not have got rid of her Lil' Quad.

We got this set for my 4 year old son for Christmas. His eyes lit up when he saw it. He dropped everything and insisted that we open it right away....we didn't, of course...we waited a whole day...thank goodness...it literally took an hour to put together. There are so many pieces that look alike but are barely different. It was very frustrating...then it wouldn't stay together once it was finished. It has been nothing but a frustration for him and me ever since. He gets so upset when he tries to play with it. We saved the box. It's going back, if they will take it...

Santa got this castle for my five year old son for christmas. I agree with many of the other reviewers, though it is visually appealing it is very flimsy and was painstaking to put together. Despite all that my son seems to be enjoying. This toy is fun for the child but not for the parents.

Our almost-4 year old son loves dragons and has one of the Imaginext dinosaur sets, so we thought we'd really surprise him on Christmas this year with the Imaginext dragon set.

While I'm very happy with how happy my son is with it (he's been playing with it for hours) I have a feeling we're going to be in much the same boat as some other reviewers.

Pros:

- Interesting color scheme
- Good detail on most pieces
- Re-configurable
- The dragon figure is really neat
- The trap door, rotating floor and other moving parts are a lot of fun for my son to operate
- Got it on sale at the local Toys R' Us for 11 dollars less than listed on the web site.

Cons
- The directions are picture-only, and much too small to see fine detail.
- The pieces are not packaged together logically, so that the elements of the set are all in one bag. You have to open every bag and lay the pieces out in order to be able to find everything and even then there's some question as to whether you've got the right part turned the right way, per the above comment about the directions.
- The whole thing comes tumbling down like a house of cards if you bump against it lightly/during casual play. I've had to put it back together no less than 5 times since I initially put it together this morning. Some of the connector pieces don't fit tightly enough into the sockets on other pieces, so they tend to just slide out instead of locking together firmly.

I think that next year, we'll just stick to Legos

My son loved the toy and couldn't wait to get it opened, but the problem came when we tried to close it back up.  The treasuer box would not close back up easily.  I had to work at it very hard, my son who is 7 could not close it by himself.  He got pretty frustrated

This thing just doesn't work, don't bother.  It won't stay upright no matter what you do, so there's no way for the kids to play any form of tether ball with it.  Looks like it would be fun if it worked.  The most entertaining thing about it was that the dog kept barking at it for some reason.

I was very excited about buying this phone for my daughter after seeing it on the internet.  That was, until I saw it in the store.  There were about 5 in stock and not one of them was in full working condition.  Most of them had not enough power to play any sounds, while others had parts broken off of it.  Don't waste your money on this product.  You will surely be disappointed

I ordered this item and was so excited. It loaded fine. It let me upload files just fine. It wasn't until I actually tried to create my PVD that I received errors that shut down the program (many many many times...with numerous types of video files) I double checked the system requirements for the software and my computer checked out fine. The worst thing is that there is no support for the media player. I tried contacting Hasbro with no response. I am so dissapointed.

My son's best friend got one of those for christmas and we went to the lake to test it against my son's regular RC boat. The hovercraft was very slow and not quite that maneuverable. It hovered OK on water, but couldn't handle sand or concrete. The "skirt" slipped out of its track a couple times (despite our being careful fitting it as best as we could), filling with water - the foam inside it didn't prevent the boat from being swamped by the smallest wave (even in good shape it couldn't handle waves like the other boat.) The thin skirt finally ripped and the boat is pretty much unusable now. Big disapointment. It was somewhat fun while it worked, the concept was intriguing for the gearhead boys, but once the novelty wore off the regular boat was a lot more exciting and all the kids prefered taking turns running that one.

Whatver your favorite fruit may be, this game will certinaly not be in your cadre of favorite games. It is basically boring, and ill-conceived. I have played it  a few times with my kids, and found it to be of no particular interest on any level-it is neither fun, exciting or challenging, for them or me. I strongly recommend you try a Cranium game , or how about CHESS??? The only positve thing i can think of with regard to this widly overrated game, is that it's better than TV, which isn't saying much

I bought this item for my 6 year old niece.  Not only was i disapointed with how it physically looked (colors were not bright like other Cars toys), I was absolutely disgusted with the name calling in one of the sayings.  I realized when it called the tractor a negative name, stupid I believe it was, that it was going back.  I wouldn't want my child having a toy that calls others names, so I wont give it to anyone either.  Not to mention, the grammar used, is not correct.  I realize that is the character, but why would I want to teach children grammer that is wrong?  All in all, disapointment, that Disney puts out toys like this

My daughter had a drink and wet doll that she could give a bath but it filled up with water and even though you couldn't empty all the water out, it still leaked everywhere. I got rid of it hoping she wouldn't notice. Well, she did, so a new "doll I can give a bath to" was on her Christmas list. I wanted to find a solid rubber doll that would not fill up with water. Like the dolls I had as a child. I thought this would be it since the top half visible in the box appeared to have no holes. Wrong. It has a soft torso filled with polystyrene beads that get waterlogged. The water all (I hope) drains out of the bottom of the feet after a couple of minutes of squeezing. Then you have to let the torso drip dry. Last night after bathtime, my daughter wanted to tuck her doll into to the doll cradle, but couldn't because she was still wet.

The other features are fine. The shower works great. You don't have to fill up the fish. Just attach it to the tube and squeeze. It suctions water from the bottom of the floaty. The doll doesn't sit upright in the floaty, but she doesn't flop completely over, either.

I don't care for the bow sewn on to the head. Who takes a bath with a bow on? But if you take it off, she'll have holes in her head

My daughter wanted a doll that goes in the water last christmas.  I chose this one, and she was so pleased.  THe doll is beautiful.  She did not quite sit the right way in her raft.  Someone needs to hold the raft while the doll is in it, or it will tip. My daugther did not like that we could not just dry the doll off with a towel, so she could take it around the house with her, but that it had to hang and dry.   Still she loved this doll and it was her favorite, until two months later when the material around the leg wripped.  Instead of trying to sew it, I figured it was cheaply made and the rest would rip also, we said goodbye.  This year I am getting her another doll that goes in the bath, but I am getting the Paul Drink and wet doll by corolle.  It is a lot more expensive, but I think it will be worth it.

The remote worked only for 2 days. My daughter loves the look of it so I am not able to dispose it off. Its a total waste of money. I wish I had read the reviews before buying it since lot of people seem to have the same problem with the remote.

I agree with a previous review, this ball pit will NOT STAY INFLATED!  My kids had barely played with it and it started tearing and getting small, unrepairable holes in it.  This is also a very small ball pit.  It is too small for two kids to easily play in it and not bang heads.  We had purchased a Little Peoples ball pit train years ago for my older daughter and it held up for years.  This was a very disappointing purchase

My son is 5yrs old and this was one of the 1st things on his christmas list. He loves Power Rangers of all kinds but when we finally opened this and I tried to put it together...I thought I was doing it wrong b/c nothing fit or stayed together!! My son still played with the dragon part that was already put together but the storage bin is useless and the rope that the Power Ranger can "slide" down is barely high enough that he stays off of the ground and he pretty much falls down rather than sliding down. The so called "instructions" were horrible and another reviewer was correct in indicating how small the pictures were. I would have never wasted my money on this if I would have read the reviews 1st (I usually do). My son played with it for about 5-10 minutes and then asked why santa would bring him something like that. In my opinion it was a huge waste of about $50 and gave santa a bad name with my son for bringing him such a piece of junk

Whoever decided this was good for four year-olds must not be a parent of said age group. My four year-old received this as a birthday present. His adult aunt could barely figure it out. It's one of those toys that collapses the moment you play with it, taking all the fun out of the imaginative play that should be occuring. We have all the little parts and bigger pieces in a pile and he just walks around with the bigger piece wondering what to do with it, even though we have the corresponding Mystic Force Power Rangers themselves. I think this toy should be perhaps 1/4 of the price listed. Simply disappointing

Bought these beads for my 18 month old. He enjoys taking them in and out of the container. They are made out of thick plastic but are too heavy to stay snapped together.  When we snapped 4 or more together they would not stay snapped together because the weight of the beads pulled them apart as soon as they're moved

Horrible...I was very excited to play this as I am a huge fan of the arcade game.  Of course, I wasn't expecting the quality to be the greatest but I was hoping for something playable.  Track ball is stingy, graphics are atrocious and there is only one course to play.  I have played better functioning, playable golf games 20 years ago on an PC.  The idea was great but this just wasn't made well.  Don't waste your money on this

I am very disappointed in the construction of this toy.  The picture on the website and the picture on the box made it look like it was made of a more durable material.  It was made mostly of styrofoam and cost way too much for what it's made of.  I have no doubt that this toy will not survive until next Christmas. I would have sent it back if it had not been from "Santa".

I just finished the World's Largest Crossword Puzzle last night.  It's been one heck of a project--approximately equivalent to 200 slightly oversized daily crossword puzzles.  I'm going to love hanging the puzzle on my wall--it really is something to behold when it's all done.  But it's also a big undertaking that requires a great deal of patience and perserverance.

The puzzle itself is moderately difficult, but made more so by the fact that somewhere during the revision (it's been re-done once) or perhaps during the original construction some errors were made.  Because of this, many of the clues don't match the answers. Add to that the fact that the author uses many hundreds, possibly even thousands, of abbreviations that are specific to a certain field (e.g. "Abbreviation used in electrical engineering") that no lay person ever has a chance of knowing, and you've got what can be an exercise in frustration.  You can work for hours on one small section and only later find out that the clue doesn't fit the answer. I'm generally pretty dogged in completing crosswords until letter perfect, but that's not possible here.  So I had to sacrifice a bit of my honor and force myself to give up after a couple of passes through the ups and downs.  Still, it's about 98+ percent solvable, which is pretty good when you consider how intricate the puzzle is and how hard it must have been to create.

Overall, I enjoyed the process and am pleased with the result.  If you've got the time and energy, I highly recommend this.

This Elmo table will suddenly go off in the middle of the night.  I had to ship the first one back to FP on my own dime to get a new one, that one was broken as well!  The cookie monster did not work on the first one and now the ABC part does not work.  this time they are paying for my return shipping but come on!  what a pain!  shoddy electrical work.  i have the same issues with the aquarium bouncer baby seat.  make sure you get this garbage on sale!

This dog looked so cute and fun in the commercials and it was the one of only two things my 4 year old really asked Santa for. Come Christmas morning, today, I open it and put the batteries in and all it did was whine and we were petting the head and chest hard. After about 3 minutes I did get it to bark then another 3 minutes later I got the tail to wag but the leg wouldn't shake for another 3 minutes. 20 minutes of trying to get it to do any thing at all it finally licked but the tongue was not wet and I did put water in it so it should have been wet. Then my daughter got mad because she couldn't get it to lick again. The dog doesn't even stand up like it appears to be doing on the box.. it just lays there. If you are buying this, be prepared to be paying for a highly priced stuffed animal because that is all it amounts to. I can't believe a manufacturer would put some thing like this out there so that kids can be disappointed on Christmas morning... this product should have just plainly been recalled

Just like a big chunk of us right now, I'm quite the sudoku addict. I just can't put those little puzzles down! So, I have to tell you first, if you haven't worked sudoku puzzles yet, you are really missing out! Get your hands on some!

Naturally, I was excited to try out a sudoku game and race against my friends to solve the puzzles. But what a disappointment! One small board, several people straining to see it, everyone racing to fill in the puzzle...it just doesn't work.

The way they designed this game was to have a board, which is the puzzle to be solved, and number tiles that you distribute evenly amongst the players. Everyone rushes to fill in the puzzle, and the person who uses all their number tiles first is the winner, assuming the puzzle is solved correctly.

First of all, if you have more than 2 people playing, the players aren't all going to be able to see the board well. Some people are going to have the board upside-down trying to solve it. That's rough! Talk about getting confused between 6s and 9s! Plus, everyone's hands are in the way while they're laying their tiles, which makes it really hard to see and concentrate on the puzzle.

Next, inevitably in the games I've played someone lays a tile wrong. Then the whole game is thrown off. The instructions say that if someone rids themselves of their tiles but placed them incorrectly, then the next person to finish would win provided all their tiles are correct. Most likely, if one person has made an error, that will have caused a chain reaction and the next person's tiles will also be placed wrong, and not necessarily by fault of either of the players. It could have been anyone who started the chain reaction.

The format just doesn't work for this game. My advice is to pass on this particular game. Perhaps a game where people were racing side-by-side on the same puzzle, but with their own puzzle, would work better

We bought this for our snowboarding 11-year-old son. Being used to Playstation and Gamecube, he wasn't impressed with the graphics and control of the characters is very clunky. It's a cool concept-- but it needs more time in development

My 3 year old got this for a Christmas gift, and I thought it to be a great idea, since he loves Elmo and bathtime.  WRONG...  the darn crayons stained my bathtub!!  I had to scrub my tub for what seemed like forever to get the stains "almost" out.  I threw the crayons away after that.  My son likes the Elmo still, but I wouldn't recommend the crayons, especially in an older-style porcelain bathtub, like ours

I'm more or less fine that they changed a murder with an object in a room to who ate the cake at what time with what beverage.  Buying this for kids and all that.  Its not as intuitive or intrinsicly interesting, at least to me, but hopefully it is to kids.  However, they also changed the mechanics of the game from adult Clue, and not in a good way.  The "room" variable for example, drops out.  Its not relevant.  Its who ait the cake at what time with what drink.  It just feels silly to set up the room pieces and move from room to room if the room is irrelevant.    

The idea is probably to change the mechanics to make the game simpler.  Well, the problem with that is it was pretty simple in the first place.  And the change sort of makes it more complex in a way.  You need to remember the rooms where you already checked tokens.  Now the sheet does list the rooms, you could use that to check off the rooms where you checked tokens.  But since the rooms are not otherwise relevant, its not intuitive to track the rooms where you checked tokens.  

The game is also incredibly cheaply constructed.  For example, the "die" does not have numbers on it, you have to put number stickers on it.  And the board isn't flimsy -- flimsy would be an improvement.  

Anyway, not recommended

I bought this for my boyfriend as a present. We both love the TV show and thought the game would be as exciting (without the live crowd, of course). But the game moves slow, no models - only picking case numbers. You can compete against one another, but its not really exciting. 

Maybe you should try the board game version - it can't be any worse.

This game is one hot mess.  I bought it for my Mom for Christmas.  We decided to play the 2 player game thinking it would be fun.  Well, the word my Mother used to describe it is "EXCRUCIATING".  This was the slowest and most boring thing I've ever played.  There is at least a 10 second pause between EACH function (choosing a case, opening the case, Howie giving you directions, taking turns, looking at your opened case. . .you name it).  Each time you switch back to the other player, THE SCREEN LITERALLY GOES BLACK!  You only see the suitcase girls in the beginning and the end.  When a case is opened, you only see two arms, breasts and the case!  When it is your turn to pick a case, there is COMPLETE SILENCE as you scroll - and I use the term loosely - up and down to pick a number.  For a "video game" which you assume to move quickly, you'd better set aside at lease an hour to play it.  You will be exhausted when you're through.  We suggest they go back to the drawing board and stop with all the pauses, play some theme music when you are choosing your case, show the girl who opens your case, have the audience clap - ANYTHING!!!!!!!!  If you buy this game, you only have yourself to blame. P.S.  I won $750,000 and didn't even care, I was just glad it was over

My daughter's birthday was to take place the next day.  At 10pm I went to Wal-Mart, and after seeing on the package "over 100 songs, stories, and games", I thought this would be AWESOME!   I bought this toy excited that the doll would actually sing happy birthday the next morning to my 2 year old!  

I installed the software on my desktop (XP machine), but the real headache came when I hooked this thing to the computer (and I am a computer guy, so it shouldn't be that hard).  I plugged in the doll with the USB provided cable, and Windows XP loaded the update to the drivers for the USB port.  I clicked "Download to Dora", and the system came up with the "Incorrect Doll" that another reviewer mentioned.  I tried Fisher Price's help files, but it was no help (in fact, it said call their customer svc department).  

Following another reviewer's instructions to try this on a new computer, I loaded this software on my laptop.  Hooked the doll in.  Had Windows XP update the USB driver.  Then with great anticipation I clicked "Download to Dora"....and.....and.....I received "INCORRECT DOLL"!  

Finally, at 1AM...I gave up.  I took the doll back to Wal-Mart.  She got a nice tri-cycle instead

Remember Spirograph by Kenner you played with as a kid? This thing Hasbro sells under the same name is NOT that toy. It is obviously of cheap quality, parred down to a handful of "gears", and designed so poorly that it doesnt really work! Stick with the original, which means purchase it used on eBay, but do NOT buy Hasbro's Spirograph.

I purchased this for my nephew and my daughter as a present.  I was significantly disappointed.  With this item having the Smithsonian name on it, I expected better construction.  While trying to assemble the item, the plastic cracked on the one.  The tubes and caps were so loose that I was afraid the bugs would get out into my house.  I put silicone around the extremely loose ones.  However, I did not seal everything so the critters could breathe.  For the price, there are other similar items out there with better construction

My daughter has the ethnic version of this doll.  She absolutely loves it.  However, as a parent I notice that the color on the lips are peeling and the doll cheeks has no color to them like the illustration.  I am also very upset that I can not get a replacement for this item.  How do you tell your daughter that Santa Claus can't fix or replace this item?

I bought this dollhouse for my daughter's 3rd birthday.  Within the first week I had to glue at least 3 pieces of furniture back together.  Over the past year I've repaired numerous pieces and the house cannot be moved without the back and roof coming off.  (It is now taped together). For $150 and with all of it's "awards" I expected much better quality.  I think ALEX needs to stop selling this house and redesign it

I should have bought my girls ipods.

Yes, these mini-muddles are cute in that they fit into little girl purses and pockets, but that's where the novelty ends.

First, it is NOT abundantly obvious to children how to work the controls to get where they want to be.  These are kids for crimy sakes!  They needs to have controls that are clear and easy.  My youngest has no idea how to get to a particular song because the buttons never do what she THINKS they should do (That's a big hint to Hasbro...don't design a product from an adults point of view.  Design it for a child from their point of view.  A button having multiple functions is very confusing for kids).  So I end up having to constantly mash those itty-bitty buttons until I can figure out where the song is for her.

Second, the process of getting music from point A to point B (point B being the mini-black-hole) is NOT a quick and easy process.  Copy here, burn there, transfer to this spot, drag/drop to who knows where.  Oy vey.  And THEN you discover the music isn't in the correct format so you have to start all over again.

As for the 128 worth of space...128 is a piddly amount of space but it is clearly advertised on the packaging that this is the amount you're going to get.  No surprises there.  Now if I could only get the darn music into the player without giving up and chuckin' it to the dog to play with.

An ipod might be expensive, but Apple certainly doesn't cause this consumer the grief and frustration that Hasbro has

My 10 year old received the Massively Mini Media Player for Christmas and she and I both are very disappointed in it. There is simply not enough memory and this product does not seem to be compatible with our Napster files (at least not readily. perhaps I could burn them to cd then rip them back to my computer and THEN transfer them to the mini media player but I have not tried that yet.)  Folks, 128MB is a joke even for a young child. There are much better players out there in the same price range. I own the Sansa e250 which is a solid little mp3 player and I am seriously considering buying the same model for her as well

This looked to be a very cool item but what we thought was a miniature picture of the item turned out to be the item itself.  How they expect you to enjoy a movie on a screen the size of a thumbnail is beyond me.  Fun idea to be able to carry this in your pocket but not worth it

I bought this toy for my son for Christmas.  I thought he would enjoy the toy because he already likes to place balls and other items into baskets and he likes rattles.  Unfortunately the toy ended up being a disappointment because it is SO LOUD!  It scares him everytime I turn it on and there is no way to control the volume.  I know lots of kid toys are loud, but I have never heard one as loud as this one.

My four year old picked this toy out with a gift certificate given to him by his grandmother.  He already had pirate sets made by Playmobil, but this looked like an interesting addition to the sets.  Well, set up took nearly an hour for his very mechanically able father, and almost as soon as he began to play with it, pieces fell apart.  NOTE:  he is NOT a careless child, nor is he rough with toys.  But this toy doesn't stand up to even the most basic four year old play.  
 

After he had had it up without playing with it for six months, we finally just boxed it.  We found all the parts and sold it for five dollars at a garage sale.  I just hope those people don't come back to reclaim their money.  Save yourself the pain and frustration and buy Playmobil's Pirate Lagoon -- this is just a cheap knockoff

This toy was a huge disappointment for me. My boys took one look at it and threw it. I thought it was much bigger than what it is. I was also upset that I spent as much as I did and it wasn't even a decent size. My boys are moving to a car themed room and it just wasn't what I envisioned. It also only says one thing which can be quite boring for small children

Differences between First Version and Added Features Versions

This car pictured could be a BASE or First Version defintely not worth 299.00 These are going for 100.00 and less on the web.

 If you havent noticed the differences in the packaging it wouldnt suprise me. Lots of people dont notice. Heres the differences below...
 
 
On these 5 cars there is TWO versions of each driver(5 different drivers) that were made. First versions or BASE version and Second versions or "Added Features" Version.
 
The FIRST versions have NO "added features" stickers and you CANNOT race ANY TWO (or more) cars of the 5 different drivers' cars at the same time! Dale Sr. and Dale Jr.,  Jeff Gordon, Jimmie Johnson and Tony Stewart cars of the FIRST versions (no added features) CANNOT race together! Transmitter frequencys cannot be changed. Speed and steering are straight function. (no varilable anything) They either turn right FULL turn or left FULL turn or it goes straight. Speed is either it goes FULL ON or it doesnt. Same for reverse gear.
 
 Again, each of the 5 different drivers' cars made are two different versions of the same car one has more features than the other. 
 
UPDATED or "ADDED FEATURES" versions have "ADDED FEATURES" stickers. 
 
 Those "Added Features" are...
Digital proportional steering (variable steering), which means you can turn the transmitter wheel slightly and the car turns a little. Turn the transmitter wheel alot and the car turns alot.
Variable speed control  this means you pull back on the trigger a little the car moves a little, pull back on the trigger all the way and the car takes off! This also works for reverse gears as well 
 
Now if this isnt cool enough... 
 
Each "Added Features" car has  DIFFERENT Frequencies for different drivers' car.  The transmitters for the cars are different as well. "ADDED FEATURES" version transmitter has two "trim" adjustments on the back of the remote as well as the Frequency Chip on the side of the remote than can be changed, and can also be changed on the chassis of the car. So if you own 2 of the Tony Stewart cars, you would have to have a Frequency pack to race them at the same time. Now, two or more different drivers' cars can race together (or Five people can race 5 different cars). NO TWO ALIKE CARS can race together UNLESS you have the "frequency of another car and transmitter"  to change it, or a "Frequency Pack" from Team Up Inc. 
 
ALL 5 Frequency Chips DO NOT come with the car in the box, off the shelf. This "Frequency pack" is sold seperately! 
 
You can also purchase tires, suspension parts and body hold down clips, fully painted and ready to use new spare OR other drivers' teams bodies, extra rechargeable battery packs seperately! 

 I have done lots of research on these cars and should you have any questions please ask...nascarnbroncosfans@msn.co

I am an active 48 year old and I own a Vurtego Pro Pogo stick. I ride motocross and I mountain bike regulary and I like the exercise and fun factor it offers. I chose the Vurtego Pro after doing some online research and I am totally pleased with the performance. The guys who designed and developed the Vurtego Pro and Fit sticks were looking for a way to offer a more affordable model for beginers and people looking for a fun but still high quality stick. The Power model came up short of their extpectations and they pulled thier endorsement due to quality and safety concerns.  For the money the Power Pogo is a fairly decent pogo stick but its not going to stand up to the abuse and demands of an expert or extreme pogo stick rider. It takes allot of effort and experience to go 6' or higher on any pogo stick. I am pretty good at mine, after about a month of use I am getting up in the 3' range and bouncing 500 plus consecutive times in a session before taking a break and going for another session or two, a great workout! I have pogo stick experience and can pull off most of the basic tricks, I consider myself a beginner to intermediate at the most. I doubt that I will ever reach the six foot level at my age, but that was never my goal. I know that the people at Vurtego are still working to develope a model that will be safe and affordable for those looking for a capeable, high quality and durable stick. If your looking to go 6' and pull off serious stunts I would buy the orignal Vurtego Pro or the Fit model for a great workout. If you are looking for a little less I would wait for the next version that the  Vurtego people will offer and endorse. I personally would avoid this one.

I bought two of these as Christas gifts.  One for my son and one for my nephew.  My kids have played with it a few times now and my wife and I are looking for an oppourunity to pitch the whole mess in the trash.  Not only does this stuff look like sand, but it gets into EVERYTHING just like real sand.  The play mat they include in this kit doesnt come close to containing the mess.  On top of all that the stuff deosnt clump together all that well.  All and all I would reccomend this product only for childeren over 8yrs and then only for outside play unless you really enjoy cleaning up.

We were really excited about this item, but have been very disappointed.  We followed the directions EXACTLY, even putting the planted terrarium in the refrigerator for 8 weeks (which was frustrating AND a pain in the neck) -- and still we have nothing growing -- after weeks and weeks of waiting!  Rotten thing to do to a kid!

The plastic dome is of decent quality, and we got living carnivorous plants from an online seller -- worked out much better.  This is a TOTAL waste of time and money, unfortunately

Growing CPs from seed is not easy!  And growing CPs in a terrarium is even harder (they need full sun, wet soil, and a special soil mix).  They grow native from Texas through the Carolinas and do not need the tropical environment of a terrarium where fungus will attack and kill.  This terrarium set up is doomed to failure.  CPs are actually very easy to grow outdoors with a little proper instruction.  Obtain your plants or seeds (takes years to get a decent plant via seeds) from a reputable online nursery (I have bought several excellent plants from Sarracenia Northwest) and then search the web for proper growing instructions.  Skip this item and the goofy terrarium domes at Walmart.

I would give this kit zero stars if I could. The instructions say that it takes 6-8 weeks for the seeds to sprout. I kept them in moist peat and warm temperatures for over three months after the recommended period of refrigeration.  Not a single seed sprouted. I finally had to throw out the whole kit when mold took over. Complete waste of time and money. 

But if you're feeling lucky, you should know that most of the seeds in this kit aren't much bigger than pinheads, and they all come packaged together in the same tiny plastic bag. So if you want to have each type of plant growing in a different section of the plastic tray provided in the kit - like that shown on the box cover - you need to separate out each seed under a strong magnifying glass.  And even then you won't be successful, as most of these seeds look just like ground pepper.  I accidentally spilled a few on the floor, and after sweeping them all up I literally couldn't tell them from the other debris in the dustpan.    

By the way, it takes a minimum of 6-8 years living in ideal growing conditions for any of the plants in this kit to reach the sizes shown on the box cover. These are NOT plants that can simply be put on a windowsill. They need an environment that is not easily provided in the average home - LOTS of very bright light (about 15 hours a day), LOTS of humidity, an acidic growth medium (such as sphagnum moss), and about 80 degrees. And even then, these are VERY slow-growing plants. 

To keep the humidity level high, you'll need some kind of terrarium, preferably covered to keep the humidity level high. But if you use incandescent bulbs to provide the necessary level of light, the amount of heat they produce can easily raise the temperature to lethal levels. For this reason I recommend a combination of fluorescent bulbs and a moist/dry heating pad at the bottom. Be sure that whatever heating pad you use isn't the type that shuts off automatically after one hour of use. 

Some warnings... 
These plants flourish only in a very limited range of environments and nourishment.  The care you would normally give a houseplant will - in all likelihood - kill these plants:
   NEVER feed them animal protein (like hamburger). The fats in meat aren't digestible and can kill them. 
   NEVER use tap water to water them. The mineral build-up can kill them so use distilled water only. 
   NEVER feed them insects that have been killed by insecticides, like RAID. Carnivorous plants should be fed soft-bodies insects like small slugs, ants, termites, etc., rather than hard-shelled insects such as beetles. Well-stocked pet stores will carry dried mealworms, but even these will need to be cut into very small pieces. Just as a baby needs tiny mouthfuls of food, so too do Venus flytraps. 
   NEVER fertilize them. These are very slow-growing plants and any attempt to force them to grow will kill them.

Unless you buy the multi arcade machines with all the major games including Mr. Do and do it right- the classic collections on PlayStation II are the best.  Unfortunately for plug and play some of the versions are jerked to very difficult levels and not as fun to play.  The monsters in the Pac-Man games are almost always on kill including following you  in the tunnel a lot of the time.  The problems listed with the joystick seem to be accurate.  Galaga was better and Mappy was a lot of fun to play- the most underated classic in arcade history.  But again it's better to get the collections for Playstation II

The doll is a great gift for little girls who love dolls.My 6 year old loved the doll.I do not like the way allysens hair sheds when you comb it.When allysen asked when is your birthday? My daughter had to keep repeating herself,when allysen asked what is your name the same thing happened.so my daughter got stuck with Happy New Year as her birthday and sweetie as her name,when you ask Allysen to read her book she asked for a smoothie,She is also very loud,my daughter slept with allysen and carried her around everywhere she went.When allysens batteries died she went back in the box

I have my own business so I decided to give back to community by assisting with Christmas for the unfortunate.  I purchased 7 Amazing Allysen dolls and a plethora of other stuff for the less fortunate.  None of the Allysen dolls work.  I purchased a Amazing Allysen for my little in cousin in Florida also. We tried to make that doll work but it would not.  I went to the local Walmart to purchase another one and it did not work either.  I am totally disappointed with Amazing Allysen.  The kids that I purchased the doll for in Raleigh North Carolina could not find the appropriate things so that I could return the dolls.  I will return the one I purchased for my cousin today because my 30 days are almost up.  This was a horrible experience.  Those kids were expecting to have a super awesome doll, but she did not work.  I felt so bad because it was like I had something to do with it because I purchased so many and none of them worked.  I did have the opportunity to return the doll to Walmart in Florida and purchased an Amanda doll for my little cousin after Christmas.  She really loves Amanda

Another reviewer said that this was a soft doll with no hard parts.  I ordered it thinking it would be perfect for my niece.  What I got was a hard plastic doll with small pieces labeled "Not for Children Under Three."  Needless to say, I was very disappointed.  This would be great for a 4 or 5 year old, but don't expect a soft, cuddly doll for your little one

I bought it for my son to use with the Original Pixter also. And,I found what it was compatible with, after I realized that it didn't work with the original Pixter. The box I have says down in the bottom right corner (if the back of the box is facing you) of the back of the box in tiny print "compatible with Pixter Plus and Pixter 2.0".  You would think they would put that on the front

The game has a nice concept, IF IT WORKED. I've been trying since christmas(over 3 months) to connect this game to the internet to update it for my kids and finally was able to update the firmware today. Something that you will have to do to be able to get to the virtual worlds,BUT THE WEB SITE IS ALWAYS DOWN!!!!! EXPERANCING TECHNICAL PROBLEMS!!!  and the nice window that pop's up on the home page from the Chief, asking for suggestions goes to a bad link!!! 

I only gave it 1 star because the review process doesn't have a 0 stars.

DON'T WASTE ANY MONEY ON THIS THING!!!!

You have to constantly adjust the arm positions of the figures so their reach can strike the head or chest targets -and it seems rigged that Supermans arms are just a little longer to stack the odds for truth, justice and the American way. Again, Cool figures weak cheap playability

After receiving, putting together and using this toy with myself and children, I overestimated what it would be.  I remember the old school Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots, and this product isn't even close.  The old characters stood 6-8" tall and both necks sprung up with metal parts when a blow to the head was delivered.  This version has only plastic parts, the characters are 4" tall at best, and the 'win' is from a blow to the chest, not the head.  Metallo's head springs up, but Superman's head only nods backward.  It is difficult to discern the 'winner' from the set up.  It was only an $11 lesson for me to learn, but if you truly want a real Rock 'em set, try eBay, or yard sales.  This replica is not comparable to the original

My 10 year old son got this for his birthday.  The screws are so deep inside the ball, we finally got so frustrated we just ripped off the foam covering the battery holder to be able to see where to place the screwdriver to get the screws out.  (The ball won't bounce anyway!)  Even then, the screws would not come out!  The lightup goal is great, but the ball is ridiculous.  Use your old nerf balls and then it's okay

I purchased this item as a Christmas gift.  On the day after Christmas, I helped my son assemble this product.  It worked flawlessly for the first day.  The next day, I turned it on to show the boys' grandmother.  Apparently, the steel ball "wheels" under the "riders" don't roll very well after initial use.  The riders would be hoisted to the top, but would fail to slide onto one of the chutes.  If they did make it onto a chute, they would sometimes fail to glide all the way to the bottom, or would fall off the chute.  The failure rate went from 0% when first used to about 90% after the first day.  I've purchased other K'nex items before and never had a problem

My wife and I were not impressed with the Caterpillar Tunnel. The material was flimsy and light weight. The tunnel is small and our children (even our 1-year-old) couldn't crawl through it without making the toy twist and roll over. Since it was not what we expected, we decided to return it and get our money back

I ordered this for my son's up coming 1st birthday party.  I figured he and his little friends can sit in there to play. 

I received the package this morning and I was in for a surprise.  First of all, 50% of the balls (it came with 100 balls) were half inflated.  The shell of the balls are so soft, and somehow the air inside was not full enough; thus half of the ball looked crushed.  Then, I thought, " fine, I just go buy another 100 balls to mix them in. no biggie".  

Then, I inflated the pit for my son to play in. No more than an hour later, the main part of the pit deflated by almost half and the plug was still securely attached.  So, there must a hole somewhere.  This toy is totally unsalvageable.  I had to make a call to amazon and they have authorized the return of this product for a refund.

This is a very low quality product.  I didn't expect kiddie toy like this will last long, but one hour is too short for me. I don't think I will buy anything from this Ball Toyz company in the future either.  I think their balls are too flimsy.

Teething two molars and a cold with a croup-like cough for over a week made my little toddler ultra-grumpy and zapped his energy.  Poor fella couldn't even play with blocks or a puzzle without falling to pieces with frustration.  I was going to buy 100 balls to put in his baby pool from the summer, but this whole thing on sale was less expensive than a pack of balls.  He shuffles around, rolls the balls down the ramps, and dunks them through the rings for hours.  No mental challenge, no frustration, and it doesn't zap all his energy.  It's made with the same weak plastic a 99 cent beach ball is made out of and overnight the whole thing is visably less inflated--wish it was a little more substantial.  The sides are not sturdy to sit on or to be used to pull-up on.  At 31 inches, he can barely get in and out safely.  The balls are inconsistent--one will be thick and hard and the next is so thin you can squish the sides in a full inch.  We're not trusting it to last a long time under everyday wear and tear.  Our plan is to store it out of the way until the next rainy day, he's sick or worse, if Mommy gets sick!  No need for an air pump.  With two of us huffing and puffing we got it inflated in under 10 minutes.  Take note that some of these ball pits have free shipping--the shipping on this cost more than the sale price

I recently purchased this item for my daughter who has been wanting to paint.  I thought this would be great because the paint is in the brush and it won't be messy.  Although all this is true, both of us found it very frustrating that it was difficult to get out of the tube.  If this is made for children, shouldn't it be easier to use and should an adult really have trouble with it

While the concept is good, there is no way to securly fasten the blue tubes to the main body, so they keep flying off and need reattaching as each child crawls through at their normal breakneck speeds. I would avoid it to be honest.

The only thing "Deluxe" about this addition is the glossy foil cover of the box, which is designed to make you think you are getting something special by paying more money. 

Nothing could be further from the truth. This edition screams "CHEAP" from the second the lid comes off. 

Let's go thru the hype above and set the record straight on all the "Deluxe" features: 

The board is a quad-fold affair, redesigned presumably to allow a smaller, less expensive box. It has much less rigidity than the single-fold board of the "classic" version. When it is left out for an extended period of time, especially overnite, the ends of the board curl up and refuses to lay flat. 

The houses and hotels are completely featureless, just small blocks of wood. They looked to be dipped in some type of vegetable dye rather than painted. This is probably an attempt to eek out a few extra cents of corporate profit. 

The "bankers tray" and "property wheel" are flimsy plastic jokes. Neither would last under play by children much more than a few games. 

This edition is a sad legacy to a great game, and the cheapness of the set detracts from the joy of play. For the additional cost, all you are really getting is the fancy foil cover and one extra play token, plus a board that curls up at the edges: Whoopee! 

My advice: Save the extra money and buy the "classic" version.

I thought the art had a certain charm, and used strictly as a picture book for children who can't yet read, I think it's quite nice.  (Too bad you can't make up your own story to go with it.)  The moment the child starts to read, though--better hide it quick, because...

Unfortunately, the book reads like a condensed Communist Manifesto for kids (as others have noted), or a Socialist agenda primer.  I don't know for sure that's what Marcus Pfister had as an aim, and I'm not going to speculate on his politics.  He has three kids and may raise them as he likes, and indulge in any such philosophical musings as float his boat.

Yes, I suppose sharing is nice.  Certainly sharing one's talents and abilities for the betterment of others is a great thing--but in America, we get paid for that (charity is voluntary, not coerced).  Furthermore, stripping yourself of what makes you unique and interesting (not necessarily BETTER, just unique and interesting), or giving away all your possessions, is a lousy way to make and keep friends, isn't it?  Is this book implying that somehow friendship can only be obtained by placating envy (a negative personal quality that should be dealt with by self-examination and intent to change, not pandering)?  Is it saying that being interesting and having unique qualities is bad?

Almost seems like it, at least to me.  Furthermore, there's an overtone of "only by belonging to a group can you have self-worth," which is as hoary a case of balderdash as ever I've seen.  Of course, people who agree with that egregious sentiment will disagree with me, but that won't make them right.

(The two stars, if you must know, are for the art.

My 3 boys (ages 4, 7 and 9) love their lightsabers so the idea of a spring activated version was too hard to pass up.  Imagine the disappointment when the fragile spring/force action is only good for about 3 tries and then it falls apart with no way to get inside and fix it.  We have 3 of them (Darth Vader, Obi-wan and Luke Skywalker). Vader was done before 9am Christmas morning. The other two are hanging on by a thread and now the boys have to be "very gentle" when they load the saber. The worst part is that the light up feature is tied to the spring so it does nothing now.  These are not rough kids and it's just a matter of time before the other springs get jammed.  Stick with the original light up sabers and forget the force action.

Bought this for my 3 year old daughter who really uses it a lot daily.  The level of edutainment is excellent for her age and she learns a lot from it.  My only sore point with it is the lack of strength of the perforated part of the pages (for the spiral binding).  The pages tend to be separated there so I think it will be a good idea to strenghten the perforated part of the book or to use some other form of binding that will not decrease the overall strength

My 11 yr old thought this was amazing but the maneuver wheels on the bottom will only run over hard surfaces and not carpet which was OK with us.  He did, however, run it over carpet and the traction wheel rubber pully snapped.  The legs are also quite fragile and after only 2 days of play, one of the legs broke.  Because of that, the spider cannot "walk" now! Too bad because its looks great.  We are going to send it back.

Man this game sucks.  I LOVE SNL, but the questions here are SO trivial.  I was looking forward to getting this for Christmas and was very excited when I opened it.  It all went downhill from there.  I think the pieces are a good idea, but they're ugly.  The DVD clues are dumb and ineffective.  I was playing with my dad (who is legally blind).  He couldn't read the questions on the tv.  I think it would have been better if the dvd was narrated.  Overall, the game sucked, the questions were silly and it wasn't fun at all!  As an aside, I noticed that there are no African Americans on the box or the board.  One could argue that Eddie Murphy or Chris Rock were more successful SNL stars than, say, Cheri Oteri.  Whatever.  Game sucks.  Costs too much.  Stay away

The only good thing about the game is the fact that the game pieces are cool.  Otherwise, save your money.  It's not worth the $$$$.  BOOO Hisssss to the creators of this game!

In order to answer the questions in this edition of Trivial Pursuit you would need an encyclopedic knowledge of the minutae of SNL.  Most of the questions were beyond the ability of my family, who have watched SNL since it began, and who quote it frequently.  I was very disappointed in this game.

We purchased this for our 3 year old daughter who loves the Disney princesses.  Even though we purchased it as a "play" bed we soon realized the poor design with the unsecured sides could be a hazard for any child.  We immediately returned the item and warned the store clerk on how dangerous the bed could be.   It's not worth the risk of suffocation for an air bed that probably wouldn't last long anyway.  I recommend you look else where for your child's princess dreams

I ordered 200 hundred of these and half of them were squashed by the time I received the shipment and you can't get the shape back. If you want good quality balls spend your money on the Playhut version.

These balls did not retain there "round" shape from the minute my 2 1/2 year old daughter played with them. The balls have that "smashed in" appearance and you cannot get them back to the original shape.  I purchased these balls to add to the ball playland made by the Moose Mountain Toymakers, Ltd that I purchased for my daughter for Christmas. The balls that were included with the ball playland have retained their shape, unlike the balls I purchased separately

Very disappointed with the quality.  Took 2 hours to put together then disintegrated as I was carrying it from the shop to the christmas tree.  I was not happy having to put it back together early Christmas morning.  Be prepared to use extra tape, glue, nails and screws to hold the contraption together.  The stairway is a joke and I threw it away as it is only held in with two 3/4" pegs.  We'll see if it survives Christmas Day.

Without my husband being handy, this would have been in the trash on Dec 26th.  Took almost 2 hours to assembly with these small wooden pegs that barely held the unit together.  It fell apart when my daughter was playing with it on Christmas Day and so my husband improvised with stronger screws to hold it together.   Though she loves playing with it - we need to find out where we can purchase the furniture that the picture shows??

Not the best toy I own.  I wanted to send it back after a week because the letter C wouldn't say it's name.  After a while it started working, but then D stopped.  According to the online demo the balls will say their colors when dropped in the chute.  Mine never have done this.
My son likes this product and uses it.  As a parent I am disappointed in the quality

I had searched high and low via the internet trying to find the perfect baby doll pram.  Good quality material, well made and if possible fold away storage ability.  When I found the Corolle Pram /Carriage I thought I found it plus the added bonus of a adjustable handle so no matter how tall my grand daughter was she could push her babies.  But when it arrived I was not thrilled.  What looked good on paper was not so in life.  True it folds away to store in a closet no problem.  But this ability is to easy and I fear the child will pinch her fingers.  All that keeps the stroller in an up right position in 2 lame flip over metal rings.  Now with the wonderful way a simple umbrella stroller for a real baby folds way, why wasn't this technology used on this product.  Sure an adult would have to fold it up, but I would feel better if that was the case then a 4 year old maybe getting broken fingers.  Also the cute canopy.  It does not stay on if you even move it to open a tiny bit.  I spent $113.00 on this item thinking I was getting a well put together item that would last years for my grand daughter.  Only way that will happen is if I can weld parts together and forget about ever wanting to store it.  
I did not buy this from Amazon only cause I wanted it right away and so bought it from another shop.  But I knew Amazon would have this forum and wanted to make sure others did not waste their money on this product.  Go with the other one for $33 at least maybe it will stay together.  Now I have to hope I can return this thing to where I bought it.  But I think Corolle should either rethink this items design or just pull it from the stores.  It's not what a good parent would want for their child.  Thanks & I hoped this helped

This game was not engaging.  My son did not find it interesting.  He has not asked to play with it again.  You push the dice around to match letters on the cards or to spell the words yourself.  

If you want to have a fun game with more of a challenge and an element of chance, try What's GNU.  It is much better for beginning readers and it actually fun for older kids or adults.

My nephew was very excited when he saw the box and the picture.  Unfortunately, the inflatable suit is not really inflatable.  It requires constant air to keep it poofy looking.  It is basically a costume that has elastic bands around the neck and wrists and requires a blower (battery operated) to blow airs in to keep it looking inflated.  The battery is heavy and will not stay put on the two inch diameter hole on the back side of the thin vinyl suit.  Everytime he moves, it pops out.  The fan is noisy so he ran around in the clingy, deflated suit for a few minutes and begged to be let out of it as the elastic bands were restricting him.  He loves superman and loves having a cape.  He opted for a regular white towel over the thin red vinyl cape the costume came with.  

I suppose we got what we paid for.  Cheap prices doesn't equate to quality.  I felt like my nephew got only a couple of minutes out of this toy.  Would not recommend it to anyone else... Unfortunately..

Dont waste your money on this one. the picture is cute. but the quailty of the toy isnt any good. the frosting doesnt even stay in the hole and the box is flimsy it would never last with a child. the concept is supposed to be like the game memory,your supposed to turn over the donuts and match the ones with the same frosting. your better off just buying the real memory game. the only thing this is good for is the pretend food concept and even with that it isnt worth this price.

The description didn't say that the board game was sold separately. I assumed a "Game pack" had all the necessary materials. It should hae said Expansion Pack. It didn't, so I had to go buy the original game. It shouldn't be called WB 50th Anniversary, it should be called "Scene It - Friends version." We played one full round with 2 teams and literally HALF of the questions had to do with the Friends tv show. All in all, I was VERY disappointed with this product.

First of all, please realize that the customer pictures of this item are totally off.  This thing is a foot cube, so there's no way you could fit any baby outside of a newborn inside of it. 

That being said, when the cube first showed up, it seemed ok outside of the size, and my 2 1/2yr old son and 9-month old daughter seemed to enjoy it.  That is, until my son realized that the wires on top were bent in such a way that there was no way for the Elmo block to move at all.  Shoddy at best.  We've had this cube for a total of 3 days now, and already at least 4 stickers are off of it, due to not being placed center on the piece they were on, or just low-quality stickers.  My children still play with the cube, as currently it provides no real safety hazard, but the price I paid for this cube was entirely too much considering the low quality.

Have this unit in out house, we have the one with one base unit and two mobile units.

A few things to note. The ones we had do not offer rechargeable batteries. It uses alkaline only, or if you have your own charger you could use rechargeable but would be nicer if it recharged while plugged in.

We live in NYC, Queens to be exact. We hear taxi cab radio chatter over this at times, especially at night. Also if unit is close to base unit static is not too bad but still annoying in bedroom, BUT if you have it one floor away, forget it. Unless child is screaming all you hear is static. on both units.

Only has two channels A & B which are set manually at both base and hand held units. So if you have a bad signal in middle of night, you have to go into child's room and change channel. Just don't wake the baby! Ouch!

Also missing a pager and a "walkie talkie" feature. They would be very nice. Not a deal breaker if they don't have it BUT it can be handy especially if your two floors up with baby with a full diaper and Spouse is in basement and you need more diapers from Garage.

I am about to have a second child, and I am replacing this unit with a better one, I am looking at one of the new digital units that have the noise/static reduction. Consumer Reports gave some of them their top marks. They are however way more pricey than these, some are near $200 and only one receiver. But they all have charging bases and most importantly they are static free with AUTO channel switching

Good luck getting this bed! I ordered it 5 months ago (with availability being 2-4 weeks. Each month I was told it will available "next month." I finally cancelled my order and purchased the Little Tykes one before my frustrated 3 yr. old outgrows a toddler bed. 

Kidkraft needs to focus more on actually manufacturing their products and less on marketing for orders they are unable to fulfill

"Phase 10" is little more than an Uno knockoff--even sharing some of the same "special" cards: "Skip" and "Wild". Then, there are the so-called "phases", which can ultimately be frustrating for both young players, and new players. Example:

Phase 3 is a set of 4 cards (4 of the same number) and a run of 4 cards (a straight). You may have the following cards: (g=green, r=red, b=blue, o=orange) 2g, 3r, 4r, 6o, 6g, 9b, 11b, 11r, 12b, wild. Ultimaely, the player before you draws a "wild" card, and completes their phase. You, however get stuck with 85 points.

With all the flaws, the game can still be competitive and fun.  If you want something educational though, buy a Leappad

I bought this toy for my son (the boy's version) for his 2nd birthday.  It was fun for a few days...until he went head over heels on a very small slope in our yard.  The toy landed on top of him, with his neck rolled and pinned under the toy.  He was so terrified of it after that, he refused to get back on.  It has been stored in our basement and will be sold at the next yard sale.  Save your money - this toy is too tipsey for toddlers and way too fast for them to control the steering

Don't get me wrong...the concept of this toy if fantastic...and when it works it is wonderful....however, it sucks up so many batteries it is not even funny! It requres 4 C batteries and we replace them at LEAST every 3 weeks! Not only that but there is something wrong with the toy that makes it stick in the "on" position even after you turn it off (very loud and sqeaky". V-Tech knows of this problem but tell you when you call to "take the batteries our and turn it off and on 20 times to reset it". Well, that will work a few times but then the toy is totally broken. AND...their idea is for you to send it to them and they will take 2 weesk to send you a replacement....hmm....is this not a toy marketed to help children sleep...so we OBVIOUSLY need it at bedtime! I offered to apy them up front for a new one and they could reimburse me but they would not bend. Needless to say I am QUITE frustrated with V-tech!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If they know it is a problem they should tell you that on the FIRST call so something can be done about it!!!
Another creepy side note....the thing says "I love you" in some strange voice to your child......SCARY!
V-Tech has a great idea here and it is the best toy of its type...however, it doesn't work....looks like they came out with the technology a bit too soon!
BTW...I rated Durability as a 1 and Amazon has it showing as 3 stars...hmmmm!

Complete waste of money!  I bought this for my 5yr old daugther and there is no way possible for her to program it!  After several frustrating attempts we finally get it programed.  Now the darn thing does not respond to her answers.  Even when I clearly repeat the answer in her ear she does not seem to register.  Complete waste of Money!!!!  Would not recommend to anyone!  Save your money and play with a rock, much more fun

I hate this doll!  She is difficult to program, eats batteries and the tags which must be plugged into her body do not like to stay attached.  Within a week her hair was a matted mess, it took me an hour to brush out the tangles and is now braided.  I would not recommend this doll to anyone.  With all the frustration this doll has caused I would love to turn it into a shooting target

My daughter wanted a Sewing Machine for her 8th Birthday. I thought it would be a good introduction to sewing instead of using my adult machine, but it was a mistake because the Singer Lockstitch Sewing Machine only worked once, when we first tried and this was it. I tried to work on it but it is so cheaply made that no wonder it doesn't work more than once. Unfortunatelly by the time we realize, I could not return it, because the box was in the garbagge.
It is just a big waste of money. Don't buy it

I am a seamstress who knows how to sew, and how to thread both top and bobbin threads.  My daughter received this machine for Christmas.  We threaded it according to directions.  It sews about 10 stitches then jams.  I observe that the bobbin design is such that the bobbin wobbles within the casing, and leads to a jam every time.  Don't disappoint a child by purchasing this

some of these reviews are amazing, seems rather professional to me in most cases.

these are just brine shrimp people, feeder shrimp for most fish.

you want to learn how to keep a pet buy one, you want to learn how to grow food for it to feed off of then this is the starter kit.

it's not a pet it's a food.

My son loved the idea of this toy and was so excited to receive it as a birthday gift.  However one club broke almost immediately and the other broke shortly after that.  It is poor quality and construction.  Don't use it unless your kids are the gentle kind.  Most kids would break this the first time.  [...

I think that this is a great idea and a very cute plush, but I immediately encountered some problems with the toy that I think are worth mentioning.  First, the battery box is very poorly designed.  Once you have opened the velcro cavity in the dog's tummy, it's nearly impossible to keep it closed again.  The dog's hairs get caught in the velcro and the battery box is too big so the cavity keeps busting open.  Now, if I handle the toy, the box keeps falling out! 

My second comment is that the sound effects are pretty bad.  The sounds quality is poor and it doesn't always sound like a dog

My son received this as a Christmas gift. He and his brother and Dad were excited...got all set up to build it...and got nothing but frustration! These are really mechanically minded guys too. Very disappointing. I was especially surprised because of the Smithsonian name on it -- you'd think they would test this stuff before allowing their name on it. My guys never got as far as the reviewer who eventually got it assembled. The screws stripped and we didn't have the appropriate glue to even attempt a rescue. It simply would not assemble the way it was advertised. I am calling Amazon tomorrow about a refund.

This is a very mediocre Knights Kingdom set.  There's not much of interest going on here, and the small castle suffers from lazy design.

The colorful Knights Of Morcia are back, once again fighting against Vladek, the black knight.  Two of the good knights make an appearance here (blue and purple), and we also get Vladek, a dark soldier, and a skeleton.  The minifigs are as charismatic as ever, each sporting his own unique expression.  Vladek and his henchman have that cute "I'm evil" Lego frown.  Our knights are outfitted with the usual accessories.  Swords and shields, and a black hatchet for the henchman.

The scene is a small mountainside castle that is home to a large scorpion monster.  The creature is constructed from a mixture of regular and Technic parts, and he has hinged pieces for an articulated tail and pincers.  The blue knight is accompanied by his horse, who has a cute mini-catapult strapped to his side.

The scorpion can fit into his den at the base of the castle, which has a front gate that can be raised and lowered.  High atop the tower is a mini-catapult and a thin boom crane with a small barred jail cell dangling precariously from it.  The rest of the castle is just walls, floors, and a staircase.  This castle is very fragile.  Mine fell apart several times while I was working on building it.  On the whole, the design just isn't all that great.  Handle with care, and play with care.  Colors are mostly black, dark gray, dark red, and brown.  This set has one of those nice walls with the barred window, and some signature Knights Kingdom battlement pieces.

This set works as an addition to Vladek's Dark Fortress.  On its own, it's stunningly less impressive.  The good news is that a savvy Lego Maniac can take the castle parts and build a better castle with them.

My verdict:  one thumb up for the scorpion monster (who can be added to your other Knights Kingdom adventures), one thumb down for the rest.  Could've been better.  My advice is to get Vladek's Dark Fortress.  It's more than worth the price of admission.  For those still hungering for more Knights Kingdom action after Vladek's fortress has been built and conquered, this set is better than nothing

We usually love all the Melissa and Doug toys, but these sound puzzles are disappointing.  I bought two for Christmas, the farm one and the vehicle one.  We couldn't open the back to put in the batteries for the vehicle puzzle (as the other reviewer said), and for this farm one, the sound quality is so bad!  The animal sounds aren't even recognizable in some cases.  The puzzle itself is fine, but I wouldn't recommend paying extra for the sound

I didn't know you had to line up the arrows on the motor part so we installed it incorrectly and it rotated counterclockwise; my husband took the whole thing apart and reversed the battery terminals so that it would turn clockwise, then it worked just fine.  The instructions don't mention that you have to align the motor to the terminals in a certain fashion or it will turn backwards.  But once you get it lined up right it works fine with Hershey's syrup.  a Great starter fountain for my chocaholic 2nd grader

Not only do you use chocolate syrup which runs off of the cookies, pretzels, strawberries, etc., but it doesn't even warm up the syrup. So, like someone else said, you may as well fill up a bowl with Hershey's syrup and let the kids dip away.  The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is because my kids did seem to have a really good time playing with this.  They thought it was great even though it was cold syrup instead of warm chocolate

This product is a waste of money after the lightbulb goes out and the lighbulb didn't last very long in the first place. Polyconcept does not make the lightbulbs available in the stores.  After numerous phone calls to Polyconcept (manufacturer) I have yet to receive replacement light bulbs!!!  So basically, it is now useless.

I have since seen other similar complaints on several websites and have written to polyconcept.  I have to date gotten no satisfaction from either crayola or polyconcept.  The lines are blurry, there is no focus to begin with.  But the real problem is that the projector detaches constantly from the base, whenever you move it, touch it, etc.  The dry erase markers don't erase from the board; and the light stopped working after the second time my son played with it.  I can't fathom buying a new light bulb at $4.95 + s&h after a total hour of use in two sessions.  I think it's probably wiring; who knows; but it's a disappointing flimsy cheap piece of garbage.

My daughter received this for her third birthday from her Grandpa and while it's a great concept and I think she would really like it, it doesn't really work. Erasing each drawing is nearly impossible, and it bothers me enough that I know it will bother her to be unable to erase old drawings and start new. So we're returning it for something else.

The pieces of this toy (the outfits, etc.) all ripped when we pulled them off the starter sheet.  Also, the pieces are too little and get easily lost when played with and the outfits are uncolorful and depressing. In general, this toy is hokey and cheap.  I recommend Melissa and Doug's Magnetic Dress-Up and/or
Magnetic Princess Dress-Up. All the pieces are wooden and are large enough to keep together.  Also, the outfits are colorful and beautiful and they come in nice wooden boxes with lids so that a child can keep things organized.

If you can smell the chemicals being emitted by these slippers than your child is breathing them in! Also the chemicals are being absorbed through the skin of your childs feet.  They are made with known cancer causing chemicals. They are also manufactured over seas wher the DEQ,EPA etc; have no jurisdiction over the processes used to manufacture these slippers.  My two year old daughter was given a pair and they are now hidden in the garage. Did not want to put them into a land fill until some one has analyzed the toxic emission from these horrible smeling slippers. Benzene, Poly Vinyl Chloride, all kill the liver.

I bought these slippers after reading these reviews, thinking "they are really cute, how bad can they smell?"  Well, let me tell you on Christmas morning they lasted about 20 minutes in the living room before they were thrown outside on the porch, and they were back at the store 2 days later being returned.  The smell is beyond awful, and is absolutely unbearable.  As cute as these slippers are for your princess, do yourself a favor and get something else.  These are horrifying

I bought 8 sets of these mats to completely cover my son's playroom.  Of the 8, there were 6 perfect sets.  The other 2 had VERY rough sections that caused major irritation on my son's knees.  When I contacted the company, they gave me a VERY hard time about the issue and basically said they wouldnt do anything about replacing those mats until they received them back and could do an investigation as to how this could have happened.  They kept saying that they had never seen anything like this before as though I was making the issue up.  In the end, I was SO unhappy with their attitude that I returned all 8 sets and went with another brand.  Be careful and check the quality of the sets that you receive!

I should have paid attention to the reviewer who stated this doll is a "piece of junk" and the only good thing is how the doll is dressed!
Being optimistic, after the first purchase of the doll proved to be disappointing (she laughs adorably; she makes the sucking noise; she makes a contented sound, which becomes 'stuck' and the mechanism on her back must be turned off; she does not kick her legs; she does not close her eyes when rocked) I purchased a second doll and this doll was less
functional than the first one. The second doll cries continually. She does close her eyes and that's it! I returned the second one and kept the first one because she is more functional. DON'T WASTE YOUR DOLLARS ON THIS ONE

I want fall asleep

I am a parent of a 9 year old daughter who loves dolls. She was given the Love me CHOU CHOU doll for Christmas (12/25/05). On Christmas day we were unable to get the doll to fall asleep, so on 12/26/05 I went back to the store to exchange the doll. With no luck I found that the second doll would not fall asleep either. I looked on the zapf-creation web-site under most frequently asked questions and received more instructions on how to get the doll to fall asleep and still the doll will not fall asleep. 
 
Apparently this is a problem, not only with the doll my daughter has but with other customers as well. If the company knows that this is one of the most frequently asked questions, why not remodel the doll so she can fall asleep like the instructions say? It is very discouraging for a 9 year old who has hopes of seeing the doll do something that is being advertised and it does not do that. It is also very upsetting to a parent who has to continue going back and forth to a store and hopes of looking for a working doll. These dolls are very expensive and should work like the instructions say they should.  

We have tried everything we can to get the Love me chou chou doll to fall asleep and nothing seems to make that happen.. I have even spoken with another parent in the store where the doll was purchased and was advised her daughter also was crying on Christmas day because they could not get the doll to fall asleep. She then explained, she had her mother a grandmother to rock the doll and guess what the doll finally fell asleep keep in mind this was not rock-a-bye chou chou. We have even tried to rock this doll with no luck of getting the doll to fall asleep.
 
I have even taken the doll back to the store for an exchange, but was advised the doll is no longer being sold at the store where I purchased it.

Bought this little cooler for the back of our ATW wagon to make it easier to haul snacks and juice around the zoo etc.  Cooler holds temp fine and the velcro straps go around the wood railings well, but this a totally soft-sided cooler with no frame or supports, so if there is anything in it, the cooler does not hold it's sqaure shape when hanging on the back of the wagon.  Looks terrible and I would have been better just rigging up a mini igloo with bungees or somethin

Purchased this for our grandchildren.  IT DID NOT WORK! Unfortunately we had thrown away the original packaging, so I assumed that it could not be returned.  It gets zero stars from this household even if the form does require at least one star be entered.

Lego is a great product, unfortunately this one's just a little too ambitious. My son fell in love with this and begged for it for Chanukah, but once we got it put together it wouldn't stay together to play with. It's great to make smaller planes with, but the original plane just fell apart under it's own weight.

I would not recommend this product for anyone over 3 & 1/2 years (unless small for their age).  My 4 yr old son (36lbs) got it for his birthday, and broke the steering wheel within 10 minutes.  There is plenty of room for him on the seat and inside the car, but its been "parked" since broken.  I wish we would have spent the money on something that would have lasted.  The plastic seems cheaply made.  The voice buttons and noises are loud and work well.  Stickers have already started to flake/peel off after 1 month.  Consider a bigwheel

The concept is perfect.  It is small but fit my bigger 3 year old okay.  The pedal mechanism is difficult to master, but doable. The steering is for slight turns not any sharp turns.  I rated this item 2 stars because the box was obviously opened prior to me receiving it.  It most likely was a returned item.  It was also defective with the metal rod for the pedal mechanism totally disassembled.  I fixed it but then the other medal metal rod came apart as well.  The product is very cheaply made, but the sound effects and look is perfect for a Batman lover.  I have written to EToys, and I will see how they respond.  My sons loved the car nevertheless

This item had a description for ages three and up.  This isn't even close.  Now I'm stuck with a toddler toy for a five-year-old who is so attached to the fact it's a Batmobile he can get in, even if his knees practically knock at his chin, that I'll never pry it from him.  He's only going to be able to  even get in it for probably two more months.  It was a complete waste of money.  It's suited for two to three-year-olds and small four-year-olds

Our grandson is barely four years and of average size for his age, yet the batmobile is much too small for him.  For a kid who loves batman, it is intriguing and he did try to use it as he pretended to be the batman of his imagination.  But after just 2 or 3 days, he gave up and returned to his tricycle. As a result, except for the initial 2 or 3 days of limited pleasure he got out of it, the batmobile has been a waste of money.  On the other hand, for a child of 3, it should be fun, I think, for at least awhile

This toy is not good at all! its hard for the reflecters to stay still and to connect. its hard to trace the picture because you can hardly see your hand! plus it the picture moves, thats it! you have to start all over again. its better if you just take a piece a paper and putting it over the picture and traceing it that way, trust me i ended up just doing that

My 7 year old saw the ads for DigiDraw and drove me absolutely crazy until Christmas rolled around last year. The look of excitement and happiness on his face as he unwrapped this toy was short-lived.
It was nearly impossible to assemble. The time and patience it required to 'trace' just a straight line was too much for an adult let alone a 7 year old. The only useable item from this entire toy were the colored pencils

My daughter, age 9, purchased this product after seeing on tv the many ways she could create images on paper as well clothing, backpacks etc.  Upon opening and struggling to assemble it, we realized that it was useless.  It is very difficult to use on paper and I can not imagine using it on an item such as a jacket.  I emailed the company to complain and after 5 months they responded with a standard - return it to the store you bought it at (an option I did not feel we had since it had been opened and used).  They should have just said "tough luck (...)".  Save your money, avoid this company and get a bunch of stencils instead.

As others have said, this is a neat concept, but in reality, it doesn't work that great.  After drawing on it, you wet a sponge to erase it.  Think about a small child wetting a sponge.  It ends up a dripping mess!  Then they end up with runny marker all over their hands, which ends up on their clothes, etc.  We're good about watching the kids, too.  You really have to take control of the sponge and make sure the board is wiped properly before the kids use it.  The other thing is that none of the colors glowed very well and the kids stopped using it after only a couple of days.  Just a very disappointing gift.  Fisher Price should have stuck with the original Doodle Pro... my kids have had it for a year and still use it

My sone LOVES this trike, but has not been able to use it much due to the fact that it keeps breaking. The first one I got had a broken steering wheel lock - it kept slipping into lock position and my son couldn't turn the wheel anymore! So I called Radio Flyer and they graciously sent out a new one(I did not have to provide proof of purchase or anything). On the new one, the parent handle would not lock into place. So I called again and they sent out a new parent handle. I replaced it and everything seemed to work fine until we went up or down a slight incline in which case the handle would come unlocked again. I called Radio Flyer AGAIN. At this point, they are sending a new one which Quality Control is supposed to look over first, and they want the old one back to take a look at it. I really do like this trike, but the quality is not great. If you purchase it and have problems, DEFINITELY call Radio Flyer to get one that works correctly. Don't even bother to return it to the store. Radio Flyer will send parts or replacements free of charge and you don't have to hassle with going back to the store

Got a very similar model at a Babies R Us several months ago, but without the adult's handle. My son is almost 2 and can almost pedal by himself, and we generally like the style, but the trike tips so easily that I rarely take it out for him to use. Never would have thought to check this but I'll be in the market for a big-wheel type trike or one that is much more stable than this model.

I cannot believe Radio Flyer put this bike out! Every single time my 2 year old got on this thing, it toppled over!  
I actually called Radio Flyer, they denied ever hearing any complaints about this model (then I found out there are plenty of angry parents out there!) After some resistance, they agreed to refund me and they did.
The back wheels are too close together, making it very easy to tip over, plus the fact that it is so lightweight makes it even more unstable.  I tried it too in the store on smooth ground, but on the sidewalk, forget it!  
Please save yourself the trouble!

Very dangerous!  My daughter was constantly tipping over on this bike.  The handle bars turn too sharp and just dump them over.  There is only one good thing about it.  The seat puts the child higher than the pedals and they can use their weight to get it going. This helped my daughter learn to pedal. The constant nose dive however....was not worth it.  Don't buy!

I bought this shopping cart for my 14 month old daughter who absolutely loves her Little Mommy doll.  She enjoyed taking the food out of the shopping cart but when she tried putting it back in the basket fell off the frame and she got quite upset.  Also, at her age it is difficult to get the doll into the seat portion without assistance from mom.  The cart itself also does not turn well when tried to walk with it

My 15 month old daughter received this as a gift, and I have to admit she loves it, but it has nothing to do with the product design. She would love any toy shopping cart at this stage. She just loves pretend cooking, eating, and feeding her baby doll. 

This toy is so shoddily made it's laughable. Some of the included foods to put in the cart are actually just cardboard boxes that wind up torn and in the garbage within the first 48 hours. The cart basket is too small, the baby gets stuck in the seat, and my daughter gets frustrated when parts of the cart fall off as she plays. It's not going to last long. The best parts are the little milk carton and the banana.

Check out other shopping cart toys (little tykes or small world toys).  We bought her a set of wooden fruit (melissa and doug). When this shopping cart dies, we'll buy her a sturdy one and add more wooden food toys (there are some excellent sets available). My advice is skip this one and buy your child something better the first time around

I bought this shopping cart for my grandaughters age 22 and 23 months old. They love pushing it around without the baby seat, without the basket. In other words they are quite adept at taking it apart & rolling around the frame. The doll is difficult to put in, the cardboard groceries were put away until they are older. The other groceries are fine, the pouring milk container is great as are the pretend veggies & mac n cheese. They both put them in the containers. I am disappointed and was looking for a shopping cart that my own daughters had, that actually looks like a cart & doesn't disassemble so easily

After hearing a lot of the songs used for other Fisher Price music toys, I expected the best from this one. I liked the songs included on the rom, but I expect a nice beat and catchy tune. (Like the Backyardigans or the Doodle Bops). These songs are performed in a dry sort of way. They aren't even as good as the Wiggles and my kids hate the Wiggles. It was a bit disappointing

THIS VEHICLE IS NOTHING BUT JUNK. IT DOES NOT MOVE WELL ON THE DRIVEWAY AND DOES NOT MOVE ON THE GRASS AT ALL. MY GRANDSON USES HIS FEET TO PUSH IT WHICH IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FROM A $100.00 TOY.
VERY DISAPPOINTED. I WOULD LIKE TO SEND IT BACK FOR A FULL REFUND

My daughters are a little young for this toy and aren't that into it yet. It is very cute, with lots of sweet, tiny, realistic pieces, and I can see it having lots of play value and somewhat educational. However, they made it so the arms are jointed in order that she can hold the baby. Well, my daughter threw the doll on the floor at the doctor's office and the bottom half of the arm fell right off. Even if it hadn't broken, you have to place the arms just right or they look totally strange. This is the least favorite barbie my girls own. If it weren't for the arms, this would be a great toy. Oh, and the back of the dresser is open, so you can't really store the small pieces in it. Not sure why they didn't just close it up to make storage easier.

This game is very difficult and lengthy to program the remotes.  Also, if you play it for more than an hour the questions repeat themselves so basically if you play it once there is no reason to play it again.  It's a huge waste of money.  For 30.00 they could have at least put a larger database of questions on the DVD or have more than one DVD included in the game.  
This is a BIG disapointment

I do not usually take the time to write reviews on products. If I am not satisfied with something I would return it and write a reason for the return. The kids used this product up in about an hour so there wasn't much to send back. When I was a kid we had spirograph and it was a great thing. The reviews for the current model said that spirograph was just a memory and the new one was a cheap copy that didn't work. I am glad that the reviews were there for that product. To save money I ordered this low cost Spin Doodles toy. Five year old kids are always excited to open a toy to check it out. I played with them for a little while to get them started and realized that we had a box of junk. Why would someone go through the trouble to develope and manufacture a toy and then sell it on the internet when it is not really usable ? The gears and holder for the paper were a mess of poorly designed and warped plastic. At least the cost was low. This one was a waste of shipping cost even if the toy was free. I hope this helps someone who remembers spirograph and what a great creative toy it was 35 to 40 years ago. I guess the technology has been lost for toys with plastic gears.

We bought a pair of these thinking they'd be an ideal gift for our 4-year-old nephew. They look great, and the hands-free styling is nice. But it's a good thing we tested them before wrapping the gift. They work terribly. We got very flaky reception with a lot of background noise, and we were less than 40 feet apart. They are promptly being returned

While the doll is beautiful, I don't think she is a good representation of Chinese people because if you look at the picture of a close up of her face, you can see that her eyes are big and round just like a European. Her nose also is upturned.

While some may say that some Asians do have rounder eyes, most do not and I don't think this doll looks Chinese enough

The first time my husband installed this toilet lock it stayed put for about 3 days.  I thought it came loose because he didn't wipe the toilet before attaching it.  I wiped the lock and toilet with rubbing alcohol and assumed the problem would be fixed.  The lock fell off later that same day.  Now the dumb thing won't even stay on for 15 minutes and when I do get it attached my 13 mo. old can pull it right off

This product does not work.  The way the toilet lock stays on is suction cups.  They do not suction to the toilet.  If they do miraculously suction, my 18 month old can easily pull or knock it off with the slightest touch.  I bought two, lost the receipts and can't return it.  I would not give this product away because it basically doesn't work at all.

My child LOVES Geotrax and plays with them everyday.  However, Big City Lights makes your track look good but doesn't have much for a child to interact; the crane has a crank to turn but the bricks are hard to get to stick in the clamp and besides a button for sounds that is about all this has to offer.  Unlike other pieces with Geomotion this one is a bore.  My child rarely plays with this piece except to watch the RC trains go under it.

I ordered this for my 7 yr old grandaughter for Valentines Day.  Upon receipt it was not operable. The user is supposed to ask the "Love Ball" a question, and then turn it over to see the answer under a clear glass window. The answer would not appear under window it seemed to be covered with a dark liquid

Since purchasing this "Executive" set, I have purchased another one at a local store.  Although both sets are relatively the same, the instruction package with my second set is much better.  The sea monkeys in the "Executive" set lasted about a month and a half.  This was due to the fact that the instructions on how to care for them were very vague.  We did not know that you needed to add air to the water or that over feeding was extremely bad for them.  The instructions in the sea monkey set we bought locally were very good and we have now had sea monkeys for over 3 months.  I believe the "Executive" set is overpriced as well

We went through the process of cleaning the tank and sterilizing the water, adding the package of sea monkeys, and finally feeding the sea monkeys and NOTHING happened. (...). Hope these are not dead

This is a cheaply made, over-priced product.  It didn't last a week and I paid over 30 dollars for it and since I ordered it early as a Christmas gift - I can't return it because it has been over 30 days!!  The drawer to pull out to get the coin rolls out will not go back in all the way, therefore the coins fall to the bottom, get stuck, etc.  Total waist of money that I now cannot get back!

This sorter is very light duty.  It jams frequently and unless the coin tubes are perfectly round, the coins do not enter them squarely.  I can not recommend this coin sorter.  I am looking for a better quality sorter...

This toys purpose is to sort your change, and it performs poorly. In mine, the quarters get stuck unless you pour coins in one by one, which takes forever. If you pour more than one coin in they get stuck or little coins fall into the slots for bigger coins. In mine the quarter got stuck in the dime slot blocking it, it no longer works

This is a very fun toy.  There are numerous buttons and sounds that my children enjoyed very much.  After you close the phone, it rings a couple seconds later, and the kids loved to answer it and pretend to talk to people.

Unfortunately the two I bought quit working within a short time of buying them.  I bought the first one last year for my son, and it lasted for about a week.  First the recording feature stopped working.  Then none of the sounds worked.  New batteries didn't help, I even opened it up to see if any transistors had burned out or there were any shorts.  Didn't find any problems...it just refused to work.

We bought a second one for Christmas 06, and it's already quit too.  We'll try to stay away from this brand

My sons got this toy for their 1st birthday since their physical therapist recommended getting a push/ride on toy with a wide base for learning to walk.  While they enjoy the buttons and sounds and like being pushed around on it, I do not find it helpful for development.  The handle pushes forward and comes off very easily, it is not heavy enough for them to pull up on without tipping over onto them, and the seat is very wide and square so their legs will have to grow considerably before they would be able to ride it.  Also some of the stickers are starting to peel off and we've only had it a month.  For an older child it would probably make a decent ride on toy, but if you are wanting a push toy to help with early walking, keep looking

The handle falls off easily so its not good for a young toddler learning to walk.The seat is VERY wide so unless your [small kid] has legs as long as a [grown up kid] its not going to be comfortable. The wideness does help with the balance of it for a child that would be pushing it but the handle popping off kind of defeats that purpose

If you are looking to add a microphone to your product then just purchase the microphone, NOT the microhpone with these two books.  If you purchase this item then you are LIMITED to these two books!!  If you purchase the microphone you can use ALL microphone enhanced books!!!  My kids LOVE the microphone.  It is great to hear their own voice and sounds.  I give the microphone itself 5 stars

Over Priced, Cheaply made, Bad assembly instructions.
It's a good Idea, but a bad product. Very over priced. I would not have mined losing out on ten dollars, but 50 plus shipping is a lot. This was the most expensive toy I bought my son for Christmas. The bat does not fully swing, because one of the guides block it. you can't control the so called pitching, the ball is a magnet that sticks to the playing field. pitch it to the bat and it may not roll to the bat, hit it and it may not make it out of the out field. Score board dials won't stay attached to the paper score board. It takes two people to operate. it's the day after Christmas and this one is going to the trash. I can't send it back because I have attempted to assemble it. It would have to go back in the same condition it was received. I would not recommended this to anyone. My son and I are both very disappointed.

This game was not at all what I expected.  The steering wheel and pedals are just for looks.  You actually have to control the game with arrow buttons on the steering wheel.  And many of the games had nothing to do with driving.  So glad I opened it to try it before Christmas morning.  This is one toy that is headed back to the store

I bought these skates for my almost 3 yr old who wants to be like her big sister.  The skates are good overall.  They are easy enough to put on and take off.  The padding inside is nice.  The only drawback I can find is the the adjustment lever that keeps the wheels from rolling on setting 1 changes by itself to setting 2 which lets the wheels roll.  I am not sure if I just got a bad pair or if this happens with all of these kinds of skates.  I will keep them but it does get to be a hassle to have to keep putting them on the correct setting.

I bought this toy from my son for his 2nd birthday less than a week ago.  It is designed for the sandbox, but has already stopped working because sand has gotten into all the sliding parts.  It also has a locking mechanism that is too difficult for even my almost 4 year old to figure out.  But my kids love to ride around on it, it's just too bad the rest of it is so poorly designed

A great idea, in theory, but I think this is a very poor design.  The wing nuts do not tighten sufficiently to hold the strings in place - they just spin around and around.  I will be able to get it working, with a bit of work and a few bits and pieces from around the house, but if I had given this to a child for Christmas I would feel awful about it..

We have two new power wheels 12 volt batteries.  They take a charge just fine with the charger that came with them.  I bought this so we could use it as a rapid charger and it would take less time for the batteries to charge.  I plugged them in and waited a few seconds.  Both batteries had the flashing red indicating the batteries were either a wrong battery or bad.  This will not charge the batteries for me.  All it does is sit there and blink red.  But the batteries charge just fine with the original charger.  How can they be bad batteries if they hold a charge and we get hours of play out of them on a full charge.  Funny that.  Makes me wonder if it is a marketing ploy for people to run right out and buy a new $50 battery to replace the "bad" one.  If it would actually work to charge the battery then it would be great.  But we cannot get past the red light with ours.  It is going right back to the store!!!  It might be slower but we will stick with our original charger from now on.

My 4-yr old daughter really wanted this for Christmas, and Santa was kind enough to bring it for her.  The quality is fine, but it just doesn't do much.  She played with it for the first day, and has touched it maybe twice since.  I've seen these on clearance everywhere I've gone lately, too.  If your child is into playing "mommy", this is cute, but the extra money you pay for something that moves and talks doesn't really equate to lasting play value with this one

My son received this car for Christmas.  It worked the first time we used it but we noticed that if we forgot to switch the car to the OFF position when we were done the batteries would die.  Each time my son wanted to use the car we would have to replace the betteries!  The last time we tried to use it we changed the batteries in the car and the remote and it won't work.  So now it's garbage!

I was also discouraged by the reviews but bought it anyway. It was a lot of fun! While it worked. We experienced the same symptoms as the other reviewers here ... I appreciate the info on how to fix it but should we have to? It's too bad because it really is a cute toy and my 2 year old loved it. I would not buy it again. If you are considering purchasing this toy make sure the company has fixed it first

I saw an advertisement for this toy on the tv.  I was SHOCKED that they were still selling it!  Years ago, my young son got his arm trapped inside the hole where the balls come out.  We had called Playskool and they had us return it to the store and they sent us a free 'I'm sorry' gift.

The one pictured on Amazon is the DANGEROUS one that many kids have gotten their arms stuck in.  If you look on the Playskool website, they have a newer version which offers a cover over the hole where kids like to stick their little paws.

Be sure you get the newer version!  It is a super cute toy, and I am glad they have fixed the problem so many have had

We bought this for our 10 month old son for Christmas.  He really enjoys it, but the steering stripped out within the first week so he can only go straight.  We have to follow him around and turn it.  Other than that it's been a good buy.  He can play with it inside and out.  He's 16 months old now and will be getting a bigger, faster 12 volt 4-wheeler soon

I ordered two soccer ball kits for my two young sons. They were unable to inflate either soccer ball on Christmas day because neither of the accompanying pumps and needles worked. If there had been no accompanying pump and needle with each kit, I would have been better prepared ahead of time to have my own pump ready. I had to go out and buy new needles the day after Christmas. We'll try again another day to see if we can inflate the balls with a different pump

As stated by the other parents on this item this belt is a cute idea, but it is so small it barely fits my [...]. It will only fit him if he is not wearing a shirt and even then if he bends down it sometimes pops off. He gets very frustrated and so am I. If I have to re-velcro this thing again I am going to scream, and he only got it this morning for easter. I called fisher-price but they are closed for the holiday...I plan on calling again tomorrow and I WILL be getting some sort of refund....hey maybe I can score a free Field Journal. HAHA... Good Luck To You All.

Although my 3 1/2 yr old loves this belt, it barely fits him. It only fits him if he wears it under his shirt as big as it will go. In fact, my 1 1/2 year old wears it very close to the edge of the velcro. The smallest setting of the velcro barely fits our teddy bear. Also the magnifying glass does not actually magnify at all, and the compass is just a sticker of a compass face. My son loves it for the brief time it sort-of fits him, but I am disappointed with the quality, and the size

I brought this because  my kids love spongebob & ice cream..perfect toy, right? WRONG!  The ice cream oozes out of all of spongebob's cracks leaving most of it on your table and very little in the cone.  We have to use half a container of ice cream just to make 2 small cones and then I have a huge mess left in the kitchen.

This thing took about 6 hours to build.  The directions are terrible and extremely difficult to follow, but I figured it was worth it because it just looks so cool.  Unfortunately after completely assembling the thing and flipping the switch the motor, on fresh batteries, didn't have enough power to lift the ball the almost 6 feet consistently.  We spent as much time trying to get the motor to do what it was supposed to as we did building it.  Ours also came with a special ball that had a skateboarder inside.  He looks really cool, but the motor never was able to lift him more than about a foot.  I love KNEX, but this set is a DUD

We've had a number of Gazillion bubble machines. 
The first - this one, with an upright rotating set of bubble wands - worked relatively well, but stopped working after maybe a dozen uses.  (Granted, one of those uses was for a few hours).  When the level of liquid is low, the machine stops making bubbles since it has to pick up enough liquid to cover the wand.  

We replaced it the next year with the Typhoon machine - this was awesome, produced a huge quantity of bubbles and worked more reliably since the bubble liquid is sucked up and put on the wands, no matter how low the supply of liquid.  It has a large reservoir at the bottom so you don't need to fill it very often - it takes a lot of liquid though.  

Our issue now is getting the liquid.  Gazillion liquid does produce the best bubbles - they last well, etc. etc. etc.  HOWEVER, very few stores stock the liquid, and except for when I first bought the first machine, no-one stocks large size bottles.  Even the online vendors like toys.com who are supposed to have them, never have them in stock (I've been on their notify list for a long time!)  I've ended up buying from someone in Canada on eBay - otherwise, buying the smaller bottles at ToysRUs, Target, etc. is just too expensive.  

Both of these machines don't really work if you try other bubble liquids - other liquids (especially the cheaper kinds in very large size bottles) are much thinner and the liquid drips right off the wands before it has a chance to pass by the blower part to make any bubbles. 

We're planning to start making our own bubble liquid and hopefully that will cover us.  Otherwise, the machines are useless now.

I hate Monopoly, but loved the idea of making my own game board. Sadly, MYOO had so many limitations! I gave it a higher ED rating because you can turn the game into an educational one, but it isn't intrisically educational.
It doesn't print out spaces with color bars, just little green squares that you glue on the board below the pre-printed color bars. The background on everything you print is School Bathroom Green. You are stuck with Lotto squares on the board (bad for me since I believe gambling is evil). And you only have twelve Good/Bad News cards. I liked making my own money, though. 
I figured out how to do most of the same stuff in Word. Here's how:
I took the board from a "Your Town" clone of Monopoly and measured between the big squares. I think the individual squares are 2.5 by 3.5, but it doesn't matter, since your board may be different. In Word, I used a legal-sized paper (I think that's A5 for you Brits) and made a table that was nine columns that's how many are on my board) and two rows. Then I messed with it to get the proportions correct. You can fit three rows on one sheet of legal paper, if the return is really small, like 5 points. That gives you space to cut.  To get color bars, get your cursor in the top row. Type any letter. 
Then highlight it, go up to "format" and click on borders and shading. Click on shading, click on a color, then make sure it says "cell" and not text or table. I use only 15 percent for most colors. Click on OK and you should have a color bar. Type in whatever text you want. Then click below to type in your property name. On printing, I found the last squares were outside the printing range, so I will only have eight squares next time and will print a separate sheet for "railroad" squares.
The corner squares are about 2.5 inches on my board. I would recommend you make them bigger, then trim to size, so you won't have any dead space on your board. Cut and glue to a board you picked up at a thrift shop or yard sale and painted or covered.
The property cards. These were actually easier than I thought. Make a table one column wide and two rows deep. Make it fill the whole page. Color as above, and type in whatever you want. When you print them out, print out 8 or 16 pages to a sheet to get cards.
For chance and community chest ... well, what I came up with was using mail merge and a shipping label template. You 
just print out on regular card or paper, and cut. The data file used for the merge would have your classy one-liners. I don't know about putting graphics in. Also, I can't figure out how to use merge. I did it once but can't figure it out now.
Money I haven't been able to do. I have QuarkXpress and Adobe Pagemaker but don't know how to use either program. Plus, I wanted to make the money in Paint or something simple. Hope these directions help someone

My title says it all.  The black balls fell off of the sticks within a couple minutes of normal use; therefore the toy was also a choking hazard.  The balls wouldn't even glue back on effectively because the ball openings were clearly too large for the sticks they were matched with.  Cheaply made and potentially dangerous

Here's a quick primer for parents looking to buy science kits for the early grade school set (i.e., K - 3rd).  Every science kit, including this one, basically tells you to mix vinegar with baking soda and "Voila!" you made a volcano.  Nevermind that in later years some kid will go hiking in the crater of Mt. St. Helen's during an eruption thinking it is just harmless cooking products.  Use safe chemicals to make scientific changing colors? You guessed it -- food dye.  All these kits basically include a set of plastic test tubes and instructions telling you to open your kitchen cupboards.  Back in the Middle Ages people who sold this kind of hokum for the price it now commands were called alchemists.  They eventually went out of business.  Buy the kid a Suzukie violin or a football helmet instead

I bought a pair of these phones for my 6 and 4 year old daughters because they love to play on the cheap phones that we were buying them from the Dollar Tree. When i first saw these and realized that they could call each other and take pictures I decided to give them a try. I have two complaints with this product. One, the battery life with constant use is like 1 hour and that was with the top of the line energizers and I could'nt get one of the phones to communicate. The pictures are a little grainy but what do you expect with a play phone.

After the safe arrived my son was very excited to use his new toy.  Unfortunately, one of the key features the toy promises, setting your own secret code/combination to open the safe does not function.  Neither he or any of the three adults in the room were able to reprogram it to the numbers he chose.  He was very sad about it but after waiting so long for it to arrive by mail, would not return it.  Since it arrived at my home I have researched other reviews at Amazon.  You already have product reviews stating the same complaint.  This is not an inexpensive toy and it does not work as promised.  It should be taken off your item list until it has been fixed.  As it stands Amazon is selling a low quality item to young children and parents who are very disappointed.

A torture device disguised as a toy. How would you like to spend all day playing on the stairwell? Might as well go lick some dirty socks. I think my dog actually used to drag its bottom along the stairs to relieve a recurring rash. Hey, Ma, why does Slinky go down but not up? Who's the genius who found this at the scrapyard? Most toys in the 1970s relied on mankind's perverse craving for repetition and/or irritation

As soon as I got it out of the box and put the batteries in, it didn't work at all. My husband checked it out and we noticed that the plastic was out of place and the little motor fell out of it's place. Well my husband clicked everything bak in place and the darn thing still wouldn't work. We returned it the next day and got our money back. Didn't even bother for a replacement because is so flimsy we were afraid of getting another one just like the first one. In ALL it was a great dissapointmen

This is a horrible edition of this game.  It has a limited amount of games and it doesn't play like the TV game at all.  Save some money and buy the old boxed editions from [...] or get the newest version...you'll like it a lot more.

3 of my friends' sons have had this tractor. All 3 have complained of the tires popping right off, exposing the wire that connects the 2 together. I figured maybe it was because they bought them from another retailer or something, maybe rough housing? Though our sons are 2, they're truly not rough with these much cherished Cars toys! :) 
Anyway, bought mine from the Disney store for [...] 2 days later, after watching my son simply watch the movie w/the tractor, play randomly w/it- nothing crazy- the tire popped right off. Thank God I noticed before my other son, who is 15 months old! 
Good luck with this one- I'm on my way to write the company on this disastrous & dangerous product- don't purchase is my advice, unless you want a sort of rental toy (it WILL break within days

I bought this puzzle for my kid after he solved the original cube.  I had read the review here and other places stating that one needed to be cautious when turning the puzzle.  However, our major problem with it was that the orange stickers (within ten minutes of playing with the cube) began to peel back and fall off.  We tried using glue (they had no stick to them) to put them back but it was not long after that the green stickers began curling back and falling off as well.

The major problem is that these turned out not to be "stickers" after all, but rather colored squares of vinyl adhereing to additional stickers beneath (all white) by means of static.  They fall off easily.

This is a nice puzzle for show (impressive on the desk) but not for actual continued use.  Hopefully, Rubik's can use proper stickers or adhesive in the future and maybe even tighten up the design so that this can be used as a fun puzzle

Great company - Terrible toy.  My daughter got this toy for Christmas and waited all day for daddy to bring home the 4 C batteries which were not included.  She was excited until we turned it on.  1) the frame is not secure and will open when you reach into the middle to change the picture disk.  2) the light is not very bright and will not work in mid-day light. 3) the image is quite small - only takes up the middle 3 inches of the paper - not even close to what is pictured on the box.  4) the clamps that hold the paper are not easy for tiny fingers to use.  5) because the small picture is in the middle of the page and the clamps are on the far edges, you can't shift the paper to re-use the paper.  You get one tiny picture in the middle of standard size piece of paper and its a waste.  

The chalk board was fine - but the whole piece slides across the table when you push to draw.  Big disappointment.

Get some washable markers and some tracing paper and don't waste your money on this suprisingly junky toy

I have the same review as the rest.  Thankfully, we checked it out after we bought it and were able to return it for another model before Christmas.  The remote control Lightning McQueen with the regular controls (one lever for forward and back, another lever for right and left) was an excellent alternative.  I would recommend it for any child over about 3 1/2.

A one star rating for this toy is way to charitable. The car does nothing but jerk, and thats only when repeatedly hitting the button. Disney should be a shame of themselves for marketing this toy! Surely they had to have an idea about their product's poor performance. My advice is everyone should print off the reviews from Amazon and all like it. With this in hand, march into Disney stores and demand (1) their money back (2) an apology. The only thing less reliable than this was my 1991 GMC Jimmy

This toy is a piece of junk. I can't believe Disney actually did any testing whatsoever on this toy. An adult can't even get it to work. The car is supposed to sense the infrared light in front of it and follow, but all it does is jerk forward a teeny bit and then stop. If anything, it senses when the light clicks off and then it jerks forward a little bit. We read the instructions and saw that the car does not work well in bright lighting conditions so we took it down to the dark basement (as if my son should actually be expected to only play with this car in the dark!) but it didn't even work there.  BIG DISAPPOINTMENT on Christmas morning that we had to wait 8 hours for it charge, and then even BIGGER disappointment the next morning when we finally got to play with it and it didn't work. DO NOT BUY THIS TOY

We bought the watch for our 8-year-old granddaughter for Christmas. It ran for about a month then stopped. I tried a new battery twice new but no luck. Cute wristbands, nice concept but the watch itself doesn't make the grade.

While I certainly didn't expect these drum sticks to be whisper-quiet, I found them to be quite loud for little kids' ears. And there was no volume control. Also, I was hoping for a more authentic drum sound that I have found in other toys. I returned them

If you are a picky mom like me...i.e you DO NOT let your child watch "sponge bob" or "Scooby Doo" and you maybe even read Mothering Magazine, DO NOT get this book.
I didn't feel the jokes were appropriate, I guess I am a bit of a nerd about these things. It isn't funny to have a headless man poor beer/ale down the "hole" in his neck. They discussed murdering Shrek (hey leap pad, not age appropriate!!!!), and I didn't like to see "human" Shrek in chains fighting to get free (nor did my son).
They have "ugly" phrases that could have been more kid friendly, my son pointed out the ugly phrases, and snarled his nose at them saying "Mom, that was UGLY!".
I was dissappointed with this book, and I am taking mine back to the store.
I really like the leap frog system, even though I don't normally buy toys that require batteries...i.e the toys do something for the kid, instead I normally buy "old fashioned" natural toys where my son has to make the toys do stuff (blocks, leggos etc) BUT I REALLY love this system. It is a treat for my son to have an electronic toy so he really gets into Playing it and of course "accidently" learning.
I also didn't like the Hop on Pop leap book for similar reasons, even though the Dr. Suess part was great, the leap pad people added unneeded "ugly" phrases again that were just NOT age appropriate. Although I did like the minimal writing on most of the Dr. Suess pages.
I do like the regular "Leap" ones...moss lake etc, and the honey pot one with pooh bear.
Sorry to be so picky, if you are not picky you will probly like this book.

Ok so my daughter was 2 3/4 and not 3 (toy rated for age 3), but she loves Elmo and loves playing with this toy. It is somewhat loud an there is no volume control. Also after 4 months of use the pen stopped working, rendering the toy worthless. Also the binding is weak and my daughter has torn the sheets with normal use. So fun toy while it lasts

As the other reviewers stated, it's difficult for my 5 & 2-year-olds (& their Mommy) to figure out.  Also, it's made of a very cheap, flimsy plastic -- which seems to be the norm for a lot of the Hot Wheels tracks, etc. Terrible truck with such great potential

Our 3 year old son just loves Hot Wheels cars.  This transporter, however, is not one of his favorites.  It's easy to see why.  The back is difficult to lower, with it being controlled by a very small button on the bottom of the trailer.  Who ever thought of this design for a child?  It's also very easy for the child to accidentally get his fingers caught in the trailer when lowering it.  

The cones and barrels are easily lost and the storage of them in the trailer is badly designed.  They have a small piece of plastic that "locks" in the barrels or cones which is impossible for a child to figure out.  

I'd recommend passing on this toy if you have a child in the 3-5 year old range.

My grandson loved this toy because of the sounds and the lights.  A month later it wasn't working at all.  We thought it was the batteries and changed them, but sure enough nothing was working.  We called Tonka and then they passed us off to the company that manufactures them...P.S. I still haven't heard from them and it's been almost 5 months.  It's not worth the money!  I highly recommend you buy some other brand of firetruck for your lil'firefighter

My 9-yr old received this toy as a birthday present. Of course it looks COOL.  Against my better judgement of immediately returning it, we opened, played for 10 mins, got frustrated, and will now return it.  The boys were VERY patient adusting the straps properly to their bodies (it took 20 mins).  Seems like good quality wiring - I was afraid they'd pull at it while strapping in, but it didn't.  Must stand 10 feet away from each other (a good thing!).  The punch/block sounds are cool, but the boys got very confused trying to figure out who scored, what the lights on chestplate meant, etc.  It's possible that you must go slow and perhaps wait for 1 player to throw punch.  Then block.  Difficult for excited boys to be so choreographed and patient!  Block with opposite hand of partner's throwing punch hand WHILE squeezing a button on palm strap of your other hand.  There's some maneuvering to get used to.  But within 10 minutes, all sound/power went down, and we couldn't get it to recharge/work again.  It's supposed to recharge quickly so I don't know what the problem is.  Instructions say when nothing happens, change batteries...but 10 mins into game?   Hmmm.  Too frustrating for all the effort

We bought this for our kids for Christmas. Of course we open the box on Christmas Eve at 10PM to put it together and there are no instructions! It looks easy but without instructions we are not sure about the pins etc. Could someone post the phone number of the company so we can call them. Tomorrow morning should be interesting! 
Merry Christmas...

The "microscope" never worked at all. It is cheap plastic and very badly made. You get a few small pieces of indicator paper and a few bags of baking soda, citric acid and gelatin plus one prepared slide you will not be able to view with the "microsope".

Very disappointing. The Discovery Channel kits are better value. Don't waste your money on this kit

Extremely disappointing. Bought the toy for my son for Christmas. It didn't come with the battery ($30 extra) and the battery is still sold out everywhere, including online, almost a month later. 

Don't bother. There are lots of other great RC toys out there

TALK ABOUT A WASTE OF MONEY.  FIRST OF ALL WHAT IS TYCO THINKING.  $70 FOR THE TOY AND YOU HAVE TO BUY THE BATTERY PACK SEPARATELY?!?!?!

NOT TO MENTION I COULD NOT FIND THE BATTERY PACK ANYWHERE.  ALL THE STORES WERE SOLD OUT. ALL WEB SITES (TOYS R US, KAYBEE TOYS, ETC) WERE SOLD OUT.  ALL OTHER SITES (SPECIALTY HOBBY SHOPS) HAD THEM AT RIDICULUOUS PRICES, WHICH DID NOT INCLUDE SHIPPING.

I FINALLY FOUND IT AT AMAZON.COM AT A REASONABLE PRICE AND I OPTED FOR THEIR FREE SHIPPING WHICH TOOK LONGER THAN I WOULD HAVE LIKED BUT AT LEAST THEY HAVE THAT MONEY SAVING OPTION WHICH HELPS.

MY SON PLAYED WITH IT ONCE AND HATED IT.  IT WAS HIS # 1 CHOICE ON HIS X-MAS LIST.  TALK ABOUT A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT FOR US BOTH

 I purchased this for about $20.00.  And I followed the directions carefully. Despite that, a coin slipped into the mechanism.  There was no way to remove it, even though I tried that as carefully as possible.
I threw the device in the trash.  I did keep the plastic tubes that the holds the coins, and I now separate coins by hand. The advantage of the tubes is that they hold exactly the right number of coins, so you avoid counting them

I recently purchased this pad set for my #22 Radio Flyer Wagon, but had to send them back.  If you check the Radio Flyer web site, you'll notice that the #22 Wagon sides only have two wide slats.  When I received this pad set, I noticed the picture on the package shows a wagon with three narrow slats.  The loops to attach this set of pads are intended to be affixed to the center slats.  Since my wagon only has two slats, and they are wider, the loops were in the wrong spot and weren't big enough to fit around the slats on my wagon.  I'm only guessing, but I think these might be for an older model of wagon

Just received my Original Big Wheel for my son and the axle that holds the back wheels on is not in the box.  I call customer service and left a message on their recorder that the part was missing.  Went to the website for faster service................ After you fill out the information, it tells you that you will have to wait 3 or 4 weeks due to high demand.  Try telling this to your kid when he is watching feverishly as you open the box.  Looks like the parts were just thrown into the box without proper packaging.  Thumbs down until I can get the parts to repair

This "game" is so disappointing. My nephew loves Spiderman. He needs fun and subtle cues to stay engaged. He was so excited to get this his first LMAX cartridge we could barely get the box open fast enough. We popped it in and had to wait until the commercials or very long intro completed. Then we had to blindly navigate through the screens to get to games. They were NOT intuitive and then THUD. He lost interest and has not returned to the LMax since. What an absolute waste of money.

I played this at a friend's party, and it was a wretched party game. It basically consists of a person reading the puzzle in a monotone voice and allowing everyone else to attempt to figure it out. It is incredibly monotonous, and a throughly awful game to play at a party.

I admire its cleverness. It took a lot of creativity and know-how to make up these challenging puzzles. But for the sake of all your guests, I emplore you: Hide this boring game. Hide it as well as possible.

The painful thing is that out of a choice between Mad Gab and Lost: The Game my friend chose Mad Gab. It's sad, really

What a disaster.  It takes too long.  Then you get a tiny gross little blob of "cotton candy".  It is quite a mess to clean.  Then the kids will cry because it is not at all what they expect and are so disappointed.  My 5 year old wants to know how Santa's elves made such a "stinky, bad toy".  Expect to be disappointed with this one

We used the machine once, and were disappointed by the performance.  The second time that we attempted to use it, it wouldn't heat.  After contacting Roseart, I was told that I could ship it to them at my expense for a replacement.  I will probably not bother, as it was a lousy product to begin with.

It was neat to be able to make "cotton candy" at home, however, the machine only makes a very small amount at a time, so it is a lot of work for not much enjoyment. It takes an adult to run the machine and watch over it since it gets hot. then it cools for almost 10 minutes. It doesn't even come with the sugar needed! The product should list it on the outside of the box..sugar not included! then you have to clean it (ADULT only)It would not buy it again.This review will not mark a 1 for educational value. It keeps giving it a 2 and I put a one (FYI

With five kids under the age of 9 and four Leapsters in the house, there is rarely a time when someone isn't playing one (if not all!) of them. We have about 10 of the cartridges, and this was the most disappointing (followed closely by Spiderman). There simply isn't enough for them to do with it. The beauty of the Leapster is the ability to interact with the games, and learn while they do it. Watching a video on a 2 inch screen just doesn't cut it.

Battery is way overpriced. Contact Battery Store near you! I did and found this same exact battery type(2-6volt Batteries) for much less. While there they told me I could use a low amp 12v Deep Cycle battery instead. It did take some time wiring (FUSED LINK IS A MUST) but is well worth it. Lasts all day and you can charge it at a 2 amp "trickle charge" with a "amp selectable" car battery charger. All told it cost me less than $60 for everything. It now longer just "Takes Up Space"

MY GIRLS GOT THIS PUZZLE FOR CHRISTMAS. THE FIRST TIME THEY WERE PLAYING WITH IT I NOTICED SOMETHING IN MY DAUGHTERS MOUTH. THE ITEMS THAT WERE ON THE PUZZLE PIECE HAD CAME OFF WHICH HAD A SCREWS AND WASHERS THAT WERE HOLDING THEM ON. THREE OF THE FIVE PUZZLE PICECS HAD THE ITEM COME OFF AND WE HAD ABOUT TEN SCREWS AND TEN WASHERS. THEY ARE SUCH SMALL PIECES WHICH I WAS SO SHOCKED THAT THIS PUZZLE WAS EVEN MADE THIS WAY. I JUST WANTED ANY PARENT WHO HAS THIS PUZZLE OR IS THINKING OF BUYING IT TO BE CAREFUL AND MAKE SURE THE ITEMS ARE ATTACHED TEH CORRECT WAY. I HAVE CONTACTED CONSUMERS AFFAIRS TO LOOK INTO HAVING THIS PUZZLE RECALLED. HOPE THIS WILL HELP ANOTHER CHILD FROM BEING HURT

I agree with the other reviews.  My four year old received the ranch as a birthday gift - none of the pieces stay together - at all.  How do you explain why the gate won't hold together - why the horse won't stand up, why the barn doors keep falling off - and what do I say to the gift giver when they see it

What a super-cheap rip-off of the original Rubik's Cube that was introduced to us in the mid-'70's. Seems like every doctor's office, break room,friend's basement,etc. had one of these cubes to kill time with. Main reason that I, personally didn't like this modern version was that after the first day or two, the colored stickers start to peel off. The Rubik's Cube HAD it's day. In this high-tech age, I cannot see many kids having any interest in this item. They might actually have to 'use' their brain. PLEASE don't bring back the Pet Rock

We got this when our son was about 4 months old and at first he did love it. There was a slight rubber\plastic smell with everything in the Tub Time tub but we thought it would fade with time. Well six months later the smell was still there and our son ended up stop playing with most of the bath toys except the squirting bath buddies.We did all the precautionary steps to keep the bath toys clean yet they grew mold in a very short amount time. 

The Playtime tub toys were good except the teething sailing boats which also had the rubber smell. Plus the stacking tubs do not make practical storage because the lids are too flimsy.

There are some good points with this product but I feel it is not worth the $35 price tag. Guess that's why it was on clearance at the store. It was the combination of quality and price that made me give it only 2 stars.

I bought this toy for my sons 3rd birthday. He likes it, but the bean bucket is really light and only takes one or two beans to tip it. He does not seem to mind because he is so young,but as he gets older I do not think this will be one of his favorites. I have a feeling this one will be sitting in the closet

This item was not at all what is seems to be.  The box was the only durable part of the toy.  I unfortuantely purchased 3 of these as Christmas gifts for 3 different boys ages 5 & 6 years old.  After seeing them open and what was in the box, I was very disappointed

My 6 year old son wanted this SO badly from Santa.  Well, he got it and it is sitting in his bedroom and has been there since the 28th of Dec.  What was a fun attention grabber initially became a boring, furry annoyance rather quickly. It is cute but there are several things that I (and my son) found wrong with the product. When he is supposed to be sleeping his eyes don't close all the way...kind of creepy especially for something that looks so real! Then his arms that move up and down and are supposed to close in an attempt to give you a hug make a HORRIBLE grinding noise!  My son was shocked by the grinding and got upset that his monkey was broken. I explained it away by saying that he probably just needed a backrub.  What else are you going to tell a child on Christmas morning when his first choice present turns out to be a bummer?!
Cute toy in theory, not so much in person though. I would not recommend this toy

This pirate chest is a total rip off.  The chest is cheaply made and the contents inside are minimal.  When I ordered it as a gift for someone, they sent me someone else's order....then refused to let me return my item for a refund when I finally received it.  The company was very rude and not helpful in the mix up at all.

The game has a nice concept, IF IT WORKED. I've been trying since christmas(over 3 months) to connect this game to the internet to update it for my kids and finally was able to update the firmware today. Something that you will have to do to be able to get to the virtual worlds,BUT THE WEB SITE IS ALWAYS DOWN!!!!! EXPERANCING TECHNICAL PROBLEMS!!!  and the nice window that pop's up on the home page from the Chief, asking for suggestions goes to a bad link!!! 

I only gave it 1 star because the review process doesn't have a 0 stars.

DON'T WASTE ANY MONEY ON THIS THING!!!!

This product is a waste of time! Don't bother. The handheld game is entertaining for my daughter, but connecting it online via the website is frustrating to say the least! Once connected, we walked around the "virtual world" with nothing to do. It is too complicated for my 8 yr old to do alone. There are much better products out there for children that are similar, but easier to play with. I would suggest Webkinz or Neopets. These 2 sites are very kid friendly and have educational games to play, unlike the Muichiz site! Good luck..

This toy can't be unsed unless you go online and "update" it.  We have spent countless hours trying to "update" this toy - and ther is always a problem.  The website is down or some other technical problem.  Then IF the website is up - you go through the whole process and the toy still does not update - so it is unusable!  It is a complete waste of money

Don't waste your time on this thing until they fix the bugs. We bought the Bratz one & it thought it was a Pawz when we took it online. After 10 or so total hours (Yes, I know what I'm doing) fighting it I gave up & took it back. Tech support is a joke. There's NOTHING in the manual or online help, only a link to tech support who sends the exact same auto response every time, and none of those responses addresses the issue.

The seller shipped promptly but the merchandise disappointed ... materials/workmanship not so hot; my husband stuck his hand all the way through a side panel while setting it up.  Since there was no taking it back from our 2-year-old after he saw it, he now has a tent with an extra window in it.  Child is delighted with the toy, parent is not delighted with durability

The parts of this set are not well made - light, flimsy plastic. The highlight of the set, the battery-operated hairdryer, worked for a few seconds and then never again, even with fresh batteries - I suspect due to poor connection. The cover for the battery compartment was badly made and didn't sit well. The rest of the items included are nothing to write home about either. I bought this for a Christmas present for my dd and sent it back for a refund

The board for this game is a pain...half the time the tiles that cover the letters stick.  It takes forever and a day to look in the book, locate the letters' locations, and uncover them too.  I love Wheel of Fortune, but you're better off playing a computerized version where you don't have all the hassle

All the above comments are SO TRUE! I can't believe the prices on Amazon. I too have been running back and forth to Walmart, Kohls, KB Toys trying to get the whole collection. I Am also missing Chick.. But, I won't resort to these tactics. The normal selling price is $3.99 - these sellers should be ashamed!!!

FOR $50, THE SCANNER NEEDS TO WORK CONSISTENTLY.  WE WERE ABLE TO GET THE ORANGE JUICE TO SCAN 3 TIMES ALTHOUGH WE'VE ATTEMPTED TO SCAN EVERY ITEM PROBABLY A DOZEN TIMES EACH.  NOT ONLY CAN A 4 YEAR OLD NOT GET IT TO SCAN BUT NO ADULT THAT HAS TRIED CAN GET IT TO SCAN.  I CAN'T RETURN THIS ITEM QUICK ENOUGH.  WITHOUT THE WORKING SCANNER, I WOULD BE JUST AS HAPPY WITH THE $8 GENERIC SHOPPING CART THAT TRU SELLS.

I recently purchased the Magic Touch N' Crawl Pooh as a Christmas gift for my best friend's 7 month old little boy.  I was so excited to read the rave reviews (with only one mentioning a mechanical sound).  To my dismay and disappointment when Pooh arrived and was started, he sounded like a car wreck was occuring every time he turned his head!  I was extremely disappointed and promptly returned him.  (I must note that Amazon.com does make returning a purchase extremely easy.)  Please be aware of this terrible sound that is much louder than the music that plays when considering purchasing this product

i hate to write a bad review- i think it's actually the first one i've ever written. this was a gift from my husband's work christmas party for our 2-year old. the extension on the pole is a stiff plastic piece and doesn't stay extended so that you can catch the fish; it folds back on itself. so our son wasn't able to catch anything with it. it would be better if the extension didn't bend at all, but just stayed in one place, and even if it did that i wouldn't buy it. it's more fun to have a pole with a string so you can reel it in

These are great little toys, and my three year old is obsessed with them! He's getting most of them for Christmas, but we've already bought him a few. They're die cast, so they are a good weight, but note that some of them have plastic pieces as well.

Even though I like these toys, I'm only giving them two stars. This is a horrible price!! I honestly bought Sally today at my local K-Mart, and it was on sale for $2.89 (normally $3.19). Now I know when items are scarce and in high demand their price goes up, but this is a crazy markup. I understand that this is a third party seller, but Amazon should note with their sellers that there is a difference between mark up for high demand toys and rip offs. I have purchased Chick Hicks ($9.50) and Lizzie ($5.00) off of eBay, but I've been able to find the rest of the cars at my local Targets, Wal-Marts, K-Marts, etc. It takes time and searching, but it beats paying these prices

Although this new release from Barbie looks very much like the real life singer, the doll itself is not something I would recommend for a child under 12. The doll is dressed pretty sccantilly and is adorned with realistic jewlerly.  It also comes with a bracelet appropriate for a teen.  The short hair of this doll and tight clothing does not lend itself to childs play and is more suited to a serious doll collector or McBride fan

This lite-Brite is a piece of junk! Don't wast your money! Maybe if I weren't comparing it to the older one I would think it was ok but even then I am not sure. I loved my lite-brite as a kid and wanted to get my daughter one so she could have as much fun as I did with mine.This has not left the box since the first day. First all of the screens where you stick the pegs are white not black like the old one so without the refill sheets it is useless.Also without the refill sheets the pegs are too big and they do not stay in.This was very frustrating! Even with the sheets sometimes they still fall out! I am really unhappy with this purchase and I can usually find something about a toy I like but not this one. I just didn't want anyone to be deceived into thinking that the screens were black and you could  make your own "art"

I got this for my 6 and 3 year olds.  They both really like it (3 year old needs help remembering which letter goes with which color).  Of course they used up the 8 designs in the first 2 days.  Hasbro.com does carry refill packs, but the website is so bad that it is hard to find them.  Don't bother searching on the word "refill"! There is a form you can print out and then mail in, but this is kind of ridiculous both in waiting and in price.  The form is under replacement parts, but it doesn't even identify what you are buying.  After digging around, I  deduced that it was refill sheets: I think 10 pictures for 6.99 including some bonus pegs?  There is an after-market web site where you can instantly purchase downloadable pictures 13 for 4.95, but you actually print them (including the black background!) on your own printer with your own ink!  Ouch.  Hasbro really disappointed me on this one.  They shuld have included at least 20 pictures with the item and should sell 40 packs replacements online for about 5.00.  Thumbs up to the toy.  Thumbs down to Hasbro.  Also, the light bulb on mine flickers all the time as if it is about to short out

I bought LeapPad Plus Writing on impulse at the store, wanting to help my son with writing, phonics, etc.

He used it a few times, but I almost have to beg for him to use it...and that's sad. I wish I would have gotten the original LeapPad or perhaps even the Leapster. 

For one thing, the book doesn't recognize all pencil movements. A child could make an incorrect number or letter, and it doesn't seem that the LeapPad would recognize it. Also, the child has to keep erasing over and over, providing limited usage.

Not only that, there are only a few books published with LeapPad Writing in mind, and the exercises are repetitive (e.g. writing the number 6 ten times).

I've bought quite a few LeapPad books and Quantum Pad books for my son, and he is just not interested after initial use. I'm sure he's learned a little bit of phonics using the phonics books and such, but I think he learns more from workbooks bought at a bookstore or a department store--and they're cheaper! Not only that LeapPad books are very short...much shorter than workbooks you can buy.

Considering that LeapPad books are usually around $15 a pop--and that Amazon doesn't carry/list them all and there is a VERY limited selection in Stuff Mart-type stores (at least, that's the case in my geographical area)--you may want to re-consider investing in the LeapPad system.

Our family has the original LeapPad, and recently purchased a LeapPad Plus Writing.  I must say that there is no comparison between the two products, and the original LeapPad system is by far superior.  My kid love playing LeapPad, however the addition of a graphite pencil is a mess!  Once the pages are written on, you can never get them completely clean, and also younger kids have a hard time erasing it all together.  If we were to do it all over again, we would have purchased a second LeapPad system, and not bothered with the "Plus Writing"

Just received one for my son's birthday. He loves it as he has a laptop like daddy. The quality is terrible, like another user's experience the right side of the device doesn't work properly and this is brand new. Apparently the sensors on the device don't line up properly with the go circles or volume icons on pages with them on the right side. I can't exchange it as I am not in the US so we can only play with half a book unless we experiment with finding where the right side sensors actually are. This of course is very frustrating to a 3 yr old as it really messes up alot of stuff.
Also the type of pencil seems rally sharp and brittle for a 4 yr old.  PS the box says for 4-8 yr olds vs Amazons text of less than 4 by the manufacturer

My 2 year old already has the items on the puzzle pieces memorized after seeing them only 3 times.  Our version did not include the "5 ways to play" as stated on the box.  (I've requested a copy from Briarpatch.)  My 4 year old - who received the gift - lost interest after the first time he played.  Both of my boys LOVE the "I Spy" and "Can You See What I See" books.  This game just wasn't challenging enough for them

My daughter (3 at the time) received this as a Christmas present and it took her all of 10 minutes to memorize where the pieces belong thus ending the usefulness of the game.  The game itself only comes with 12 puzzle pairs (24 total pieces).  I would avoid this game entirely.

I gave this to my fiance for Christmas, who loves Sudoku and video games, so I thought it would be a brilliant combination.  He was excited, but has been frustrated by how not easy it is to play.  He can't always tell where the cursor is on the board, so if he sets it down for a minute, he can't see where's he's left off.  Then when he was playing in the semi-dark while we were on a train, he couldn't see anything either (backlight would be a nice feature).  It just seems this model is not designed very intuitively: he keeps wanting to press clear to change a number, but it clears the game.  all that to say, 2 million puzzles sounds great...unless it's too frustrating to play

 This particular Sudoku handheld was not as expected. It has only basic functions and the person I purchased for said it is easier just to do Sudoku on line or in the newspaper or in a puzzle book. Really inconvenient functions. May be good for young children, but not adults

I bought this for my daughter's 1st birthday after seeing an ad for the entire set of Chicco Happy Garden products.  My daughter loves the Little Tikes set that is at her daycare and this looked similar but much cuter.  The eggplant has been a bit of a disappointment.  She would sit on it and rock for a few seconds at first but would quickly lose interest.  Now that we have had the eggplant for 3 months, it has been completely shoved aside.  It just doesn't rock much.  I can't imagine a child over 1 wanting to play with it.  The eggplant has very little curve to it and is pretty boring. I would stick to the Little Tikes set.

My daughter wanted this for Christmas more than anything.  But the doll is very difficult to use.  Suzie has these sudden shutdowns where she turns off for no apparent reason.  Then suddenly she'll come back to life later.  She "grows" almost instantly.  Despite my best efforts to try and protect the grow button.  I reset her constantly.  Getting her to do all of the fun "big girl" things she is suppossed to do  is frustrating for my five year old.  Essentially, I have spent more time fiddling with Suzie than my daughter has spent playing with her.  And the face paint came off almost immediately.  Even with the small amount of time that she has been working.  Perhaps when my daugter is a little older, she can spend time fiddling with her.  She does play with her as just a "baby doll" so it hasn't been a total waste.  But I certainly didn't need to spend the extra money for all of the electronics that don't work.  Oh, and sometimes I'll walk into my daughters room and she'll suddenly "wake up" and start saying MaMa.  Very horror movieish.

Thanks to those of you who reviewed this..I WON'T waste my money.  I too remember the good old days when the clasp was metal and you could load up the case and it stayed shut.  I'll stick to plastic tubs that click closed and allow you to see inside.  Too bad Barbie/Mattel is missing a great money-maker by going cheap on quality

I purchased two of these cases for my daughters, ages 5 and 7, but we were all disappointed with them.  It supposedly holds 3 barbies and their accessories, but they are hard to close if you put that much stuff in.  They also come apart everytime the girls open them, and they are hard for the girls to put back together.  They are good for keeping all the little Barbie accessories out of the way.  I just wish they were better quality.  A friend of mine has a soft plastic case for her daughter (with a zipper), and she says it is great, but I have not been able to find that item anywhere

I found this toy to be a waste of money.  It was hard for my five year old to close or put more than two things in it.  It says it holds three barbie's and cloths but then how do you close it

My cousin bought this for my daughter thinking she would have hours of fun making braclets and necklaces. However, she can not even use the gift.  You need to buy the Totally Beadifully Jewelry Maker to use this kit.  No where in the online description of this toy on Amazon does it tell you this.  Toy is being returned b/c we don't have the bead maker

All the cut shapes are the same, so it's very easy for my 3-1/2 year old to force pieces in the wrong place. The pieces also seem thin and flimsy. The coolest thing about the puzzle is the lunchbox/carrycase. All in all, the quality is much less than I expect from Ravensburger .

The Ravensburger "Thomas Giant Floor Puzzle (24 Pc)" is a far superior product, but no longer complex enough for my kid

My 7 year old son received the Giga Ball for Christmas. It was a big hit. He and all of his cousins had a great time with it for several hours. Unfortunately, the very next day, it pretty much fell apart. I didn't expect it would last very long, but had hoped that it would last more than one day

What a waste of time to air this up.  It developed leaks in less time to it took to enter the credit card info to order it.  This was the worst gift because it had such a high expectation but turned into the biggest disappointment.  The vinyl was so thin that rolling it over normal bermuda grass created holes from small seed pods and sticks.  Save your money..

This toy looks great in the ad but it took us 2 hours to blow  the dozen or so chambers up.  The instructions were terrible.  You have to force too much air into one chamber so that it will go into the next.  The chambers do not stay inflated and some don't work at all.  My son does still have fun with it but I wouldn't buy it again

My son received this as a gift when he was 15 months old--He was already much too tall for the toy!  The box advertizes height adjustment, which simply allows you to lift it up about a half an inch.  However, even if he were smaller, the base does not even come close to providing the necessary stability to stand up to even a soft swing!  My son was amused by the lights and sounds for a brief period of time, but quickly lost complete interest in the toy.

The only good thing about this kit is that your child can get some joy out of painting a few volcanoes on a cheap plastic sheet.  But the real promise of this kit--to see a model volcano erupt--may not be fulfilled.  We followed all the steps and got tripped by a poorly designed base (above mentioned cheap plastic sheet) that is extremely difficult to balance on 4 ill-fitting stilts.  A poor experience for the kids.  The eruption was more of a fizzle.  Waste of money and time

My little brother received this toy as a present, and constantly had problems just keeping the toy together. He barely had any fun with it, since it fell apart most of the time. My brother is generally good with toys, and he has fun with practically anything, but this toy proved to be the exception. You could buy something much more fun for the same amount of money

If you are planning on getting a good deck then do not waste your time with this..it has the essentials, sure, but your money is better spent at one of the 4 "STRUCTURE DECKS"!! They are much better than this..I can say so beacuse my sis owns this deck and I can beat her every time :) Konami needs to put some better stuff in this deck - like Senju of the Thousand Hands X 2. Also they need to take away the change of heart since it's "advanced" forbidden. but still, this deck deserves an OK rating since it has all the essentials..this is no better than the first yugi starter deck. So if you ALREADY have a starter deck, do not get this as it is not worth it - a lot of weak non effect monsters.

Differences between First Version and Added Features Versions

This car pictured could be a BASE or First Version defintely not worth 299.00 These are going for 100.00 and less on the web.

 If you havent noticed the differences in the packaging it wouldnt suprise me. Lots of people dont notice. Heres the differences below...
 
 
On these 5 cars there is TWO versions of each driver(5 different drivers) that were made. First versions or BASE version and Second versions or "Added Features" Version.
 
The FIRST versions have NO "added features" stickers and you CANNOT race ANY TWO (or more) cars of the 5 different drivers' cars at the same time! Dale Sr. and Dale Jr.,  Jeff Gordon, Jimmie Johnson and Tony Stewart cars of the FIRST versions (no added features) CANNOT race together! Transmitter frequencys cannot be changed. Speed and steering are straight function. (no varilable anything) They either turn right FULL turn or left FULL turn or it goes straight. Speed is either it goes FULL ON or it doesnt. Same for reverse gear.
 
 Again, each of the 5 different drivers' cars made are two different versions of the same car one has more features than the other. 
 
UPDATED or "ADDED FEATURES" versions have "ADDED FEATURES" stickers. 
 
 Those "Added Features" are...
Digital proportional steering (variable steering), which means you can turn the transmitter wheel slightly and the car turns a little. Turn the transmitter wheel alot and the car turns alot.
Variable speed control  this means you pull back on the trigger a little the car moves a little, pull back on the trigger all the way and the car takes off! This also works for reverse gears as well 
 
Now if this isnt cool enough... 
 
Each "Added Features" car has  DIFFERENT Frequencies for different drivers' car.  The transmitters for the cars are different as well. "ADDED FEATURES" version transmitter has two "trim" adjustments on the back of the remote as well as the Frequency Chip on the side of the remote than can be changed, and can also be changed on the chassis of the car. So if you own 2 of the Tony Stewart cars, you would have to have a Frequency pack to race them at the same time. Now, two or more different drivers' cars can race together (or Five people can race 5 different cars). NO TWO ALIKE CARS can race together UNLESS you have the "frequency of another car and transmitter"  to change it, or a "Frequency Pack" from Team Up Inc. 
 
ALL 5 Frequency Chips DO NOT come with the car in the box, off the shelf. This "Frequency pack" is sold seperately! 
 
You can also purchase tires, suspension parts and body hold down clips, fully painted and ready to use new spare OR other drivers' teams bodies, extra rechargeable battery packs seperately! 

 I have done lots of research on these cars and should you have any questions please ask...nascarnbroncosfans@msn.co

Anxiously awaited this very expensive box of cards mostly for the special insert cards but there was only the Autograph card and NO MEMORABILIA CARD. You cannot realize the disappointment one feels when this happens. You look and look, searching through the wrappers and identify each card hoping that you missed it somehow, but no. No Memorabilia Card as promised right on the box and in all advertised articles. Of course, the Topps Company doesn't have a website for me to complain to but this did turn out to be a surefire way to find another hobby!  Thanks.

I had to return this product for my son because I couldn't get  his name which is unique. If they make a product they should have something on it to make unique names by typing it in if it's not on the list. I mean there are more and more unique name sout there and there sure will be more. If i was a rich person I am sure I could have had one made just for him. Get witht the real world people and make things so unique people can have things too.

My 5-1/2 year old son received this for Christmas.  He loves pirates and legos, so it seemed a perfect fit.  We were wrong!
The Mega Bloks are poorly made, and it's very difficult (even for an adult) to get the pieces to stay together.  Imagine how frustrating this is for a child.....we will never purchase Mega Bloks products again, we're sticking to the original LEGOs!

Nothing more satisfying than spending money on a gift that makes your child scream and cry in frustration...thanks MegaBloks

I bought these for my 13-year old niece, who loves percussion, and was so excited to get them for Christmas. They looked like a great buy.

Well, the disappointment was palpable two hours later. We got them hooked up, installed appropriate batteries etc., and the light was on, but we could not get any sound from the drumsticks at all. Which was a bummer, but OK, if we could simply either (1) get help or (2) easily replace them.

Nope.  The "instructions" were a tiny folded sheet of paper, there is absolutely no troubleshooting, no help, no nothing.  I went through everything that came with them but could find anything to help us on next steps or returns, etc.  I finally retrieved the original plastic packaging and found a URL in tiny letters for the company. But when I went there, the site again offered no help, tips, or troubleshooting (just a PDF of the really awful original instructions). 

There is video on the website showing someone playing the drumsticks but this was no help to us in trying to troubleshoot (except to mildly disappoint my niece when she realized that you have to drum "in the air" to get the best results -- which we did try, with no luck or sound, again).

I next e-mailed the company and got no response. I e-mailed them again and -- seven days later -- the e-mail (in badly worded English) simply asked me if we had tried "plugging in the head phones." Seriously.

Anyway, do NOT waste your money. A terrible product, no support, and no recourse if it doesn't work as it should

The hide n seek care bear really wasn't all it was made out to be. My kids played with it, with my husband, on Christmas, and they all gave up after 5 minutes. It was giving out wrong directions, and just wasn't really a good substitute for a game of hide and seek. So my girls forgot about the remote control and play with the doll like it's an ordinary stuffed animal--an rather expensive stuffed animal

It is just like Mr. Potato Head except not as many pieces.  There aren't very many options to dress SBSP, but he is always a fun toy.  After a year of play, he is a little torn at the edges, but overall in good shape.

I should have paid more attention to the reviews. He is top heavy. There's also no way to store the extra parts like Mr. Potato Head. But I love Spongebob anyway and he's now a part of my collection.

Well, the toy just does not perform the way it's suposed to. They don't fly high in the arena and hardly EVER knock eachother out as they are suposed to do. VERY unhappy with product. HUGE disappointment for my 6 and 8 year old sons!

This is a cute idea, and a cute design, BUT! It is not realistic! When you put your babydoll inside, it takes a bit, esp. for a child to get the sling hanging around neck correctly and turned right, then, the poor baby doll falls, directly out of it, no back support on it, the only way she stays in is if your hands never leave her! So if the price, which is on sale right now, lures you, I would suggest an older child, rather than , say 3, or so, my 3 year old, doesnt like it, and for her abilities, I dont like it either, but now, my 6 year old, she can do it, when she is being patient enough! Only 2 stars given, for its cuteness and price at the moment, otherwise too difficult and unsupportive to suit my girls:)

After reading the other reviews of this product, I felt confident enough to go ahead and buy it as a gift for an 8 year old boy. He is learning multiplication tables now, so I figured this was a great present. 

Unfortunately, once the batteries were in, it kept malfunctioning and when the dials were twisted to 2 numbers, it would read out two totally different numbers and give their result instead of the 2 numbers the dials showed. We tried over and over to get it to work, but it is a DUD!

I live overseas so returning it is not an option I am willing to pay the extra freight/duty for. I bought another Leap Frog product at the same time that I have not given as a present yet, I really hope it works

I purchased the Twist & Shout Multiplication for my grandaughter who is 8 years old.  She has not put it down since she received it.  However mine was malfunctioned and would not give multiple choices.  It would only ask the question and then gave the answer. She was hesitant to give it up when I explained I needed to exchange it for another.  This is the only toy she has that has held her interest for long periods of time.  She nows brags to friends that she knows her multiplication tables

I purchased two of these hand held Deal or No Deal games for my two 8 year old twin boys. The boys found that they had trouble indicating that they'd like to "Take the Deal".  When the pressed the button to say "Yes" to the deal, the game continued as if they said "No Deal".  They got annoyed, but kept on playing.  I tried the game, thinking that they did something wrong, but I also had the same problem.  I'm annoyed because the game was $20 each and I think it doesn't work properly!

Our daughter became this as she was a baby. We tried several time during her past 2 years if she would reach a moment to like it, but she always wanted to go out after 1 or 2 minutes. Maybe other babies are diferent, but I think its not the right material for such a playground. For a hot environment like ours in the south, it quickly gets very hot inside and you can not leave your baby or little child alone playing because of the plastic material that can be dangerous. We finally sealed the holes on the bottom and do not pump up the upper part so we fill it with water and use it as a litle pool, thats the only way for us to use it

I was anxious to get this game for my daughter for Christmas, as she loves all princess things.  Unfortunately, the instructions were so confusing (do they even test these games?  with real people?), we quickly grew disenchanted with it, and tossed it.  Quality is not top notch, and the instructions and actual game concept are poorly thought out

Ok, maybe that's a bit strong, but this is hands down our most hated toy (by the adults, and the kids are plenty frustrated, too).  We received it as a gift (and WOW whoever would pay $35 for this is CRAZY.).  Our son is nearly five & needs help to load the truck, which has to be loaded fully to work without jamming; a time-consuming procedure, since the dominoes have to be loaded one-at-a-time.  The dominoes themselves are also almost too lightweight to stand well on end, and are prone to easy collapse.  After the initial newness wears off this toy is going to disappear, and that's something I've never even contemplated before

The truck gets clogged up often, it is extremely difficult for our kids to load and they almost always require an adult to load.  The tower is decent, albeit, it doesn't quite work as advertised as well.  Our kids wound up just knocking down the dominos the old fashioned way.  I grew up in the "Domino Rally" days and compared to the original toys, these don't stack up.  

The truck and tower just aren't worth it, you are better off buying a bag of dominoes and letting your kids make their own domino trails

I was very dissapointed with the product, it was displayed as something that was simple to use and fun for all ages....I ordered 4 of them for my grandchildren and when they opened them for 
Christmas, we found that they were "clumsy" to use, the sound quality is poor at best, and they are made of hard plastic which is not particularly safe to be "whacking" on anything and everything as I was led to believe.  We are a musical family and therefore more inclined to try to produce music from various sources, but I am afraid this is not worth the money.  If I had opened them before Christmas I would have returned them, but it was too late so now they are stuck with them

Although these keys are one of my 14 month old son's favorite toys, one of the buttons came off and fell into the shell of the remote control.  It was the larger button to turn on the light and he would have likey choked on it had it fallen into his mouth.  If you purchase these, be sure to supervise your child playing with them at all times!  However, I would suggest not purchasing them

Mixed low review-  The single biggest negative is the contrast/brightness level of the screen, which makes it near impossible to see except at certain angles and light conditions.  Unfortunately, that is a huge Achilles heal.  Otherwise, great electronics, features, and stylus operation.  I would try to demo this before buying since the screen issue could be a deal breaker (unless there is something wrong with mine, which I doubt, I would not buy this again

My children have loved playing in this tent. I like it also because it is not huge and doesn't take up a lot of room, but it is also not made out of very durable material.  I picked it up to move it out of the way and it ripped.  It is easy to pop-up and down, just will probably not have a very long lifetime with kid's play

Hideaway bought for my daughter who loves it.  Easily assembled, up within 60 seconds. I have noticed that there are two loops attached to the hideaway, presumably to tie some rope to them and then stake to the ground. There was no rope or stakes with the purchase, I am unaware if these should have been included. Two entrances into the hideaway, the front inverted T entrance is great. However, the rear is a porthole type entrance, not good for children when playing games as they can trip on the material in the bottom. Material not that durable, but with care there should be no issues. a lot bigger than it looks on the site, which was a nice surprise.

I agree with all of the other reviews about this tent and its durability, however my daughter absolutely loves it.  First the three plastic sticks that come with the tent to hold it open broke and warped pretty quick.  I went to Home Depot and bought three wooden dowels for 79 cents each and cut them to the correct length and it works great.  My daughter uses this mostly inside and it is fine, when outside the wind and everything else did move it around.  I bought a 4 pack of plastic tent stakes from target for about $1 and put one in each corner to hold it in place, works great.  I think we paid $19 for this at Target and it definitely seems worth the amount of enjoyment my daughter gets.  If you are expecting a $200 high quality camping tent, you will probably be disappointed

I bought this game on the fly cause the cover illustration looked so interesting that I couldn't resist. The instructions were a little confusing to understand at first, but once gameplay started it was picked up pretty easy and much fun was enjoyed by everyone. The game is geared for those ages 10 and up, but it was so easy to understand and so much fun, that my 8 year old neice was able to play without teaming up with an adult. The game promotes math skills which is a HUGE plus since many games today are only about fun. This game has it all, fun, education and the artwork on the cards is fantastic. When we played, we threw in chocolate gold pieces so we'd have real pirate plunder and everyone had to speak like a pirate. It's a really great way to spend quality time with your family and it's fun for all ages

I have bought quite a few barbies from Amazon recently, including the caligirl series, fashion fever series, and barbie loves micky mouse. This barbie is quite different to all above. She does not have a rubber skin like others, so we may see her leg joints if she is wearing a skirt or shorts. Her foot is quite flat; only the slippers in this package fit her; all other barbies' shoes do not. I guess this "pooh" might be made with the "former generation" technology

We received this item as a gift from grandma because my son loves barnyard animals, barns, etc.  He LOVES the tent; however, the construction was so poorly thought out that he cannot touch it without it falling over and collapsing on top of him!  There is no way to anchor it to the floor (weights, etc.) to keep it from toppling over.  The sides have no stabilization whatsoever.

The idea is super, but maybe they should consider more product testing to ensure its durability

I was so excited to get the time tracker and am now so frustrated with it. The first one that I got did not work at all...they sent a second one and this one worked for less than 5 minutes (we tried 3 different sets of new batteries). It is such a great concept, but unfortunately is very poorly made. I was also surprised at how cheap looking the whole thing is in real life.

If 0 stars were an option, that's what I would have given this awful product.  Doesn't work anything like they show on TV.  So sticky, messy, and slimy, and the smell is just awful.  I didn't even want my kids to touch it because of the terrible chemical smell.  I find it hard to believe they can label this product "non-toxic".  Total false advertising.  Do not buy this mess

I bought the familiy fun pack ($65) from the ad on TV!  What a mistake!  When it arrived one tub was open and spilled all inside the box while another unopened tub was nearly dried out. No return label or customer service number was enclosed so I couldn't even return it! It is such a mess and smells like chemicals.  It stuck to a votive candle holder ok and it looks kind of cute but when you try to just mold it all it does is stick to EVERYTHING including your hands.  Some are really gooey like slimy paint while other tubs are nearly dry and you end up with micro-mini styrofoam beads all over the place and they sink down into the carpeting and won't come out.  Needless to say, it sat around for awhile until it finally made it's way to it's new home....the trash

Do not waste your money. My son was so excited to get floam. He had been asking for it for a very long time. Finally I gave in and bought it. It is like little pellets in green slime. It is so wet and slimy that it is not possible to mold it into anything. And you can't stick it to anything like they show in the commercials because once you thouch it it is hard to get the slimy mess of off your hands. It is very messy and impossible to play with. The commercials are very misleading.

My 3-year-old son liked Floam because of the goop factor, but unfortunately the goop the little foam pellets are suspended in seems to be a GREAT medium for growing MOLD.  This happened to us twice (despite clean hands/work space) so we gave up on it entirely.  

I suggest you try PlayFoam instead.  It's also available here on Amazon, or at Lakeshore Learning Store (look for samples at the checkout for 49 cents!) Playfoam has a nicer consistency, less sticky (but still moldable) and no odor

Am totally dissatisfied with ths wagon as it came dented.  The wagon is shipped in a cardboard box with no styrofoam or other packing - the wagon bed absorbs any impacts.  The parts are in the bed and there is cardboard to prevent scratching - there were no scratches and the finsih was nice.  The pacaging is totally inadequate.  I would return the wagon if time permitted.  I am glad that I am not giving it to a child as a gift.  Buy it where you can look it over first to be sure it's not damaged

If one good thing can be said about Dread Pirate, it's that the physical game components reek of quality.  The cloth game board, glass jewels, metal coins, wooden dice and pewter game pieces all come together to give an overall sense of realism to the game.  It's a pity, however, that the game itself isn't nearly as exciting as the pieces.

Dread Pirate relies entirely on random dice rolls to determine every single outcome of the game.  To move from place to place, you roll dice.  To challenge another player to a "skirmish" (which is how you steal their treasure), you roll dice.  To steal jewels from an enemy's port, you roll dice.  To trade for jewels at a port, you roll dice.  There's absolutely no semblance of any real strategy in this game.  You win by accumulating the most treasure, and the amount of treasure you accumulate depends entirely on how lucky you are in your roll of the dice.  

This game is not fun, and can even be frustrating, especially for a young child who keeps rolling low numbers.  There's SOME thinking involved...  you need to judge for yourself who you should attack and when, but even if you make the best possible strategic decision, you can still lose the die roll and end up empty-handed.

I would recommend Dread Pirate only if your family is specifically looking for a game where you don't have to think, and only if your children are mature enough to deal with bad luck (as good/bad luck is the only way to win/lose this game).  If you're looking for an enjoyable family game that everyone can play, I would very much reccommend Cranium over this.  It's less expensive, there's ALOT more to it, and it will have your family getting up, being active, and laughing out loud (instead of sitting around and rolling dice to determine the number of jewels you can take)

You can't be serious.

We are not in the caveman era, you know. We have games to play that involve strategy. This game is pure luck - roll a die, roll a die, lose. It is like playing Roulette. Even Blackjack and Monopoly have choices. There is no way in which a "good player" can win in this game more often than a "bad player", as there is no way to be good or bad at this game.

We have eurogames. We have games that involve strategy. We do not need this baseless luckfest

Our family bought this tank and we went through plenty of goldfish with it. We stopped buying when our 10 year old was using the scope to look at the fish. She was pulling it up and down and turning it and when she was finished, she put it down and saw that she had put it down on the actual fish. The fish was bleeding and died. The kids were not very happy. I guess this is an okay tank but not great. You might want to put only beta's in it. I would suggest getting something with a filter and heater if you want any other kind of fish

I got this for my daughter who will be 10 in Feb. She has wanted a sewing machine very badly. This one is made of cheap plastic, and no matter how many times we read the instructions and try to close the end, as soon as we remove it, it unravels. I think I'd spend more money and get something better. As my daughter says "It's very irriating."

We purchased this for our daughter as a Christmas gift.  What a nightmare.  First of all, the scissors it came with...well let's just say my teeth cut better.  This scissor is so DULL we'd be willing to allow our three year old to handle it.  It cuts NOTHING.  This sewing machine comes with one tiny square of material, so you have to be sure to have material on hand if you want your child to actually attempt sewing something.  It's incredibly difficult and frustrating to thread the needle.  The stitches are way too loose and break apart at the slightest touch.  There is no bobbin, so there's nothing to hold your stitch together.  We wanted to make a simple little pillow for my daughter's dolls...wishful thinking!  The minute you attempt to turn your project right-side-out, the stitches come apart and you have NOTHING.  My daughter just walked away. We can't believe Singer would be the maker of this 1.99 piece of plastic.

These were purchased for my Grandson for Christmas. They are hard to get on. Clumsy and don't have the effect they would have you believe. He never really used them and  a waste of money. They were useless and also very dangerous.  Defintely would not recommend.

My daughter just turned seven and we got these for her birthday because she loves to be outside.  She thought they were cool for a few days and now they are sitting in the garage.  We put the appropriate number of strings on for her weight (56 pounds) but she doesn't seem to bounce very high.  And she needs help getting them on.  She was upset because some neighbor boys made fun of her due to the fact that they are so big and awkward looking.  I wouldn't tell someone not to buy them but I wish I would have gotten something else for her.

Purchased 2 pairs for my 8 & 9 year old daughters for Christmas. The shoes are made of cheap pieces of plastic. The box includes bunches of black, elastic bands that you need to really s-t-r-e-t-c-h onto the shoes to provide the "bounce". The more your child  weighs, the more bands you use, but you have to double or triple them onto the same hooks. They are very hard to install and could be dangerous if they snap back into your face while you are installing them. Once assembled, the kids played with them for about 10 minutes before becoming bored. They haven't played with them since. Don't waste your money

Like many of the other reviews (that I read after receiving the doll), I got a hispanic doll with red hair... whoever heard of that!  My daughter is adopted from Guatemala and has black, straight hair.... This doll depicted how I style her hair and would have been a perfect match, as it also had black hair.... after waiting for a week, I received the doll, expecting it to look like the one pictured, and it wasn't.... I am highly, highly disappointed, and have emailed all of my contacts telling them about this and giving them the sight to view all the unhappy comments on this as well as pass along to their contacts..... I will never make this mistake again....  as the saying goes.... "Fool me once, shame on YOU...fool me twice, shame on ME.... well, shame on them!!!

I was very happy to discover that I could purchase an Asian Cabbage Patch Girl doll...it was for a little Korean girl....the doll pictured on the website looked like the little girl that it was purchased for (the hair). Well, I was excited to find one and I wanted to make sure that I would receive it in time to wrap it and mail it to Texas in time for Christmas.  I ordered in on the 27th and received it on Dec. 1st (I paid for faster shipping).  When I opened the box it was an Asian doll but not the one with the ponytails...this doll had short hair.  I called Amazon immediately and although they expressed being sorry they said that they could not guarantee that it wouldn't happen again. I have used Amazon before with no problems but I am extremely unhappy with the bait and switch.  I should have read the other reviews.  I will never let that happen again.  BEWARE...do not order things of this nature from this website.  You will be disappointed

OH MY GOSH-THIS IS TERRIBLE! My husband and I bought this game because I loved watching this as a child. This game uses the same prizes and games over and over. If you played once you have played too many times. The games are boring, the prizes are boring and it is a waste of money and time. I don't know why the box says "13 and up" because my 10 year old daughter could play this. This one is going back to the store-I got zonked out of my $24.99...if you want my opinion take the cash and run

At first this case seemed like a good idea, but after the 3rd use, the zipper broke. Since the case does not stay open on its own, there is  tendency to push the case open and force the zipper backward and apart. After fixing it a couple of times, it is now permanently broken. Bad design. Maybe Velcro would have been better

I would give this toy a 0 if it was an option.  When you unfold the tiny track and get the train going, it can't even make one corner turn without coming off the track!  The train is too big for the sharp corners and it either sticks or completey comes off the track.  This is very frustrating for my kids and I cannot believe they even put this on the market?  You can't even get it to stay in the track when you manually push it.  I am just bummed that we threw away the box before we put in batteries and saw how bad this toy really is.

We wanted this toy for portability.  Our kids also have the GeoTrax Working Railway, which is awesome, but not as portable

This was a fun and very portable toy for my 18-month-old son.  Unfortunately, the elephant noise quit working after about 6 weeks of play, and then the monkey noise stopped working about 2 weeks later.  Also, the train easily comes off the track, but my son loves playing with the train that way, too.  He's very disappointed that the animals are now quiet

Normally I am a big fan of the little tikes name, but not so with this product.  I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old daughter and although the concept is cute, it is not like other Little Tikes products.   To begin with, the train frequently comes off the track.  Also to activate it, you must press the button where the conductor goes.  However, it is difficult for my daughter to place the figure on this spot without it falling off.  She often presses the button in the process which activates the train while she is still trying to put the figure on it which frustrates her.  Since this is geared for toddlers, you would think that Little Tikes would have put the button to activate the motion in a different spot from where the figures go.  Also, at age 2 1/2 she is quickly bored with it.  She has more fun letting it go on the floor across the room than riding on the track.  Needless to say, it is going back.  The only good feature is that you can "pack it and go" for away from home fun

Dont waste your money.  I bought a set for each of my kids, and they didn't work well.  The paper that came with the pens, was thin and cheap.  We followed the directions, and twisted, and it either didn't work, or blended for a split second, and then back to original color.  Total Waste of Money.  They are now in the trash

I bought this toy for my four year old for Christmas thinking it would be the perfect toy for her since she loves Care Bears and she loves the game hide and seek. This toy was a big disappointment! She was so excited when she opened the package but when we tried to play with it, she got frustrated and lost intrest very quickly. The Care Bear "finder" does not give good clues to where the Care Bear is hiding and makes it very confusing for a child. It was saying "come find me" even when she was within a couple feet of it and she had to be right on top of it before it would tell her that she's "getting warmer." It doesn't let the child know that they are getting close to it until they can see it. My daughter gave up on it quickly because she would be wandering the house aimlessly without any clue as to it's where abouts. I do not recommend this toy to any one. I would have given it no stars, but she does like the bear itself. Do yourself a favor...buy a care bear (much cheaper), hide it somewhere, and you can truthfully tell your child when they are "getting warmer!

Don't waste your time with this thing.  By the time we invested in the toy, the batteries, etc. we had quite a few dollars into it... for about 15 minutes of fun.  The toy can't just be set down on a table, so when my son actually gone bored with it (to my shock because he LOVES bubbles) he tried to set it down and it spilled the remaining GOLD solution all over.  Yuck.  Mommy promptly threw the toy in the trash.  

This toy is just a gimmick - stick with the good old magic bubbles and save your money

The bar is nice, and I suppose the mat will come in handy for reviewing the basic positions. But the DVD... it's just awful. The music is painfully bad. Seriously, what dp little girls dressed like fruit have to do with ballet? And the "host" is a confusing choice: her accent is distracting, and it's made even worse by the fact that she's talking around braces. The two little girls who help her don't look much happier. In fact, the one on the left looks like someone told her to smile or else. 

Trying to keep up with the nominally enducational DVD is harder than you might think, as the mat has two sides and you have to flip it over mid-stream, only you get no warning and no time to do it. And the positions are introduced too quickly and with no discussion; they're just lyrics to the annoying song.

Our daughter got this for her 3rd birthday, and she actually looked at me the first time we watched it and said, "I want the fruit to go away." I had to laugh out loud and tell her I did too! Overall, I'm sorry her grandparents spent $15 on this. Total disappointment

The idea behind this isn't too bad, and my 4 year old really enjoyed them for a short time, but it has some really ridiculous quirks.
The shoes are not on any type of timer, so they will stay on indefinitely unless your child turns off each of them individually.  So what ends up happening, of course, is dead batteries within a day or so.  The wand and the tiara both work fine, so maybe that set wouldn't be too bad, but it annoys me that they would even release something as ridiculous as this

I am very unhappy with this product.  The handle is hard to turn, and it takes too long for the clown to pop up.  When the clown does pop up it smells like a forst fire inside of the toy.  Over all I would not recomend it

My boys thought that a treasure chest sandbox was a cool idea, being into the pirate theme. Thankfully I purchased this sandbox in-store, because I returned it the very same day.  I didn't even fill it with sand before I realized it was a cheaply made toy.  The plastic is thin and was bent or warped in a few places.  The lid wouldn't fit on correctly, even if it wasn't bent at some of the edges it wouldn't have been a good, secure fit.  I was surprised that Little Tikes would make something so flimsy.  I exchanged it for the Step 2 Naturally Playful Sandbox, which is sturdier and the lid works much better.  Spend the extra $10 for a sandbox that is higher quality.

I purchased this toy for my 3yr old in December last year. He has not been able to use it since we have not been able to find ANY products (discs, carrying case etc) for the videonow. I have called the company several times. Everything is always unavailable and I do check on a regular basis. My son has been watching black and white discs recently from his older brother on the machine so he will get some use out of it. It was a good idea but the company leaves a lot to be desired. If you make a product make sure that there are enough discs. It is simply a waste of money and time. I cannot continue going on line and checking a couple of times every week. I hope this info factors in in your decision to purchase this toy

She is DISGUSTING!!! The only good thing about her is that to scare people away simply show them this doll and they'll go screaming! My friend, Lucy Banette, has this doll. The hair tangles, the clothes rip, and even she admits it SUCKS!!! Her white skin makes her look like a vampire ghost. Not one for decoration!!! Not even for a 'playing-with' doll. Too fragile and disgustingly sickening to look at! What are we trying to teach children here??? That it is good to dress like you have just died? Have you ever seen a goth look like this? NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So please, MGA, carry on with lil' Bratz. THEY RULE!!! But NOT your silly gothy, punky Bratz. I have two lil' bratz. They are in the collection 'life style'. I have Sasha and Cloe. I don't know why you called Cloe Ailani and Sasha Zada. They are STUPID names! I HAD to redo their names! It feels nice to express myself! Bye, to goth haters! GO AWAY, you silly fans of this Bratty goth doll

What a disappointment! We got this for my daughter because of the enticing TV commercials that make it appear to be fun, moldable and not messy.  However, it is none of those and is VERY MESSY!  It is just a cross between dust and sand and NOT fun to play with OR to clean up. It stays on your hands and a child can easily wipe their eyes and cause problems. Go with Play-Doh or Floam instead

This obviously is a re-release of the OLD "Empire Strikes Back" kit released in the 80's.

A decent size kit (approx 15 inches) it gives an experience modeler a good opportunity at super detailing.

The kit is relatively easy to build out of the box, but it has many inaccuracies most notably the inaccurate sensor/bridge deflector DOME on top of the ship.

These inaccuracies can be addressed by looking in the Internet for replacement parts and articles on addressing those inaccuracies.

However, the kit is worth the price.

My only disappointment is the kit is not in scale with the new "Republic Star Destroyer" from "Revenge of the Sith".  The new kit for the new movie is over 19 inches long.  In order for this kit to be in scale with the current movie version, it would need to be about 24 inches long.  

Hopefully someone will make the "Imperial Star Destroyer" to that scale.

These Rook cards do contain the larger font of an earlier edition.  However, the yellow suit is very pale and difficult to see. After we opened the cards (two sets were purchased), we found that the Rooks on the backs of the cards were printed upside-down.  The cards are also not particularly sturdy. These cards appear to be irregulars

My daughter got this for Christmas and it only says, "Know what goes good with everything? Ripped Pants!"  Then he sings, "You won't end up like the fool who ripped his pants." and then says, "This is so embarrassing!"  My daughter dropped the toy once and it said a different phrase but we can't get it to do it again. It seems like it's stuck in the "demo" mode and we can't figure out how to make it work.  

I called Fisher Price and due to unsually high call volume they disconnect you after telling you to call back another time,  Probably due to the fact that every parent who's child recieved this toy is calling to complain.

We bought this item for my Daughter's Christmas present and the strings do not work at all.  All it does is play the 3 songs, and the microphone works.  But the other functions (anything to do with the strings) do not work at all.  We bought this at Toys R Us and we're taking it back tomorrow.  As I can see from the reviews (which I wish I'd read earlier), we'll be getting a different brand of guitar.  These seem faulty as a rule.  Do not buy this

My daughter is almost three, and she was so excited when she received this for Christmas.  Unfortunately, the strings do not work, and also the star buttons are supposed to play notes and/or chords, and they don't work, either.  I was going to send for a replacement because my daugher absolutely loves this, and I was so disappointed when Amazon responded there are no replacements available.  I'm going to see if the manufacturer can replace it

My daughter got this doodle bear for christmas 2006.  She wrote all over it and I washed it like the directions say.  I took it out of the washing machine and the bear was ripped.  She played with it again and I washed it again in the pillow case.  The bear came out of the washing machine worse off.  It seems that the bear rips at the seams.  Don't waste your money on this bear.

We finally bought these Barbie Magic of the Rainbow dolls for our 4-year-old twin daughters after hearing them beg for it repeatedly after each time the commercial aired. At first, they were very excited to play with them. Positives: The doll is durable. It encourages participants to follow instructions. Negatives: I notice my daughters have to wave the doll a few times before the DVD "hears" the instructions. 

Positives: The DVD provides clear and easy to understand directions, so your doll can be programmed with your remote control. Negatives: The doll set off our fire alarm a few times before we figured out it was the doll (and we did check to see if there really was a fire!) When the DVD is not in, the dolls control the volume on the TV! This can be very annoying when the volume increases just as you realize your daughters have started playing with the dolls. My suggestion: de-program the doll when your kids are finished playing the DVD! Or, just keep it deprogrammed and use your remote -taking all control away from your kids and keeping them from standing so close to the TV

This is probably one of the best booster packs out there. Every monster that comes in the pack has an effect. Effect monsters can be very useful. Not to mention that my very first Pharaonic Guardian pack came with a secret rare! That is one of only two of the most rare cards in the whole pack! Even the common cards are great. Such as Giant axe mummy or the Gravekeeper cards! Your deck cannot be complete without this booster pack! I highly suggest this pack

We bought this for our son for Christmas this year based on glowing reviews. What a disappointment! The "musical instruments" are basically glorified rattles that all sound basically the same, the song the drum plays is tinny, scratchy, and short, and nothing seems very well made. I at least expected the different instruments to sound different from one another. 

On the plus side, it is cute, and the lobster has a pretty wind chime like sound

Ok, my kid loves it.  But, after seeing it in person, I cant believe how much I was charged for list little plastic toy.  Cost is way over excessive.  Strongly suggest saving your money, unless money is no object

My son received this as a birthday gift and it broke the 2nd time that he played with it. While I was putting it on him the plastic belt just snapped in half. Luckily we had a different belt from another toy that we could use with the gadgets. The previous reviewer was right about the difficulty of taking the gadgets on and off. There's no way that my 4 year old son could do it without my help. If I had the receipt I would have returned it

The pieces were very tiny and the sticker flags kept popping off the plastic. My daughter's favorite part was the pink and white horse with the carriage, which she promptly took over and put with her dollhouse. After asking Santa for a Cinderella Castle she was a bit disappointed. This playset would probably be fine for a child who was just going to set it up and not play with it

My sons received this for Christmas and it's already out of commission. The quality of the fabric (more like paper) is such that the polls very quickly poked through, leaving the folding/elasticated sticks to stick out.

It's a great idea, but if it was a better material so that it would last more than a couple of weeks...

Here's hoping that I can sew up the holes without tearing it more

This high chair is a lot smaller than the photograph implies.  When screwing together the sections, I managed to split the wooden bar that would be the foot rest.  Any half decent person with a jigsaw would be able to make a more sturdy toy.  This toy is very basic, the seat of the highchair is wooden with a skimpy section of cloth.  Invest in some power tools and make your own, I guarantee it would be better than this one

The item arrived to us the week of Christmas three weeks after we had ordered it.  It arrived with several broken and several missing parts.  Amazon would not send us new parts, they would only replace the unit if we shipped it back first.  This was to be a Christmas gift to my son, so that was not optional.  Had the order arrived when the order tracking said it would I would have had time to return it

I'm not sure how this toy ended up with a 4.5 star rating after all the broken microphones!! Ours was yet another that broke within 2 months of gentle play. It wasn't thrown or dragged around by the microphone or anything of the sort. My son loved it and figured out the microphone very quickly. He loved to see the lights and the little puppy "dance" when he "sang" into the microphone. I continued to let him play with it even after the microphone shorted out and the static began and he still kept trying the microphone until he got frustrated and then I finally put it away. I wish I had spent the money on something that would have lasted longer. My son is now 18 months old and the only other toy he has ever managed to break was the Vtech Nursery Farm which was broken 3 weeks after Christmas last year, just before this piano broke. I highly recommend Fisher Price or LeapFrog toys over Vtech. We have never had a problem with their toys and 2 of the 3 Vtech toys we have owned have broken on us. Garbage!

Even though yugioh is dead, this is my favorite pack (even though i don;t get them any more). The deck that i made is an Archfiend deck, which can kill you if you don't have a spell card on the field that says you don't have to pay life points for Archfiend cards. They are also one of the strongest group if cards. There is TerrorKing Archfiend, InfernalQueen Archfiend, Archfiend Solder, and others. Even though yugioh is dead, some people still play ot, and some stores but them from you. I sold my deck for $$$, you should too.

I was really excited about this toy. I was very forgetful when it came to putting my son on his tummy, so I thought this would be a great toy for him to  have some good quality tummy time on. Wrong. He could care less about this toy. The second I'd lay him in front of it he would just roll onto his back. He was five months old when we bought it, and it is just sitting there. He STILL loves his Gymini and he is six months old now. Also, by the third day the aquarium had sprung a leak..which apparently has happened to almost everyone who  has bought this thing. Do not  purchase this toy, it takes up too much space, and it's a waste of money. Baby could care less about it

When we bought this, I liked the versatility it offered.  I quickly noticed, however, that it is mostly good for strewing the soft pieces everywhere.  There are actually too many pieces to keep up with, and frankly I'm getting sick of stepping on the cow.

My 6 mos old likes it for a couple minutes, until he's rolled away from it.

My 3 year old thinks it's interesting, but she just ends up taking it apart and the pieces end up all over the place.

After a couple days of playing with it I usually put most of it away and keep out only a couple parts to complement our other toys.

The water play mat lasted until my 3 year old stepped on it once or twice.  Then that was gone

I thought this toy looked fantastic as I was searching for developmental toys to help in various areas while they grew. The versitility of this one looks great. Well, I liked it more than either one of my children did, as they almost never played with it except for the simple joy of taking it apart and strewing it all over the playroom! The black and white face was good when they are first starting to be attracted to faces but other than that, it just got taken apart and lost its interest, no matter which way i arranged the peices. Infants would do much better with a flat playmat with a mobile suspended above their heads

I bought this item for my newborn - thinking it would grow with him and be useful for at least the 1st year.  I was SO wrong.  First, as I feared, the water "fishbowl" leaked the 1st time I filled it.  I returned it and the next one leaked as well.  Then, the mirror is one of those "plastic" mirrors that gives a distorted reflection - which was of no value or interest to my son. The cow that makes noise died after less than a month of light to no use.  Finally, the toy just didn't have that "fun" value that a $43 toy should have.  He hated it - never attempted to crawl down it, never played with the features. Save your money - this toy is of poor quality and poor entertainment value. There are tons of better products out there..

My kids love Magnetix, but I am unable to order them online because you do not ship to Canada. This problem occurs a lot. Someone should fix that. I find it very frustrating when I try to order something and then it tells me they are "unable to fullfill my order because we can't ship outside the USA"

Our family loves all types of memory games, and this is the most attractive.  The colorful stripes on the back are great, the pictures are good, the click of the squares on the tabletop are satisfying, and the fact that they are true squares means that they fit easily and perfectly into the box.  My only negative comment is that there is no indication  which country each child represents.  The children who play this game are capable of learning country and costume together...I think it is an obvious teaching opportunity. In fact, I would like to know this myself

The dolls and outfits in this set are adorable and the case was a cute idea.  The only problem that kept me from giving this item a high star rating is the case itself.  I wish the case closed more tightly, it closes with a small gap along the sides also the entire case lid keeps coming off easily.  Overall tho, aside from the annoyance of the lid, for the price it was still worth purchasing because as I've said the dolls and outfits are so adorable and a great addition to my 8yr old daughters polly collection.

She is not operating properly and since I ordered the doll a month and a half beofre my daughter's birthday, I was unable to return or exchange. I was told to contact the manufacture. I guess the doll was mishandled before it reached me...Be careful

My daughter received this as a gift for her first birthday.  She loves tub toys, but when you pull the tail on this one it just sits in the water.  My daughter actually plays with it more out of the tub and my husband figured  out that it actually works better if you pull the tail and let it  &quot;swim&quot; on the floor.  I'm a big fan of Sassy toys, but I'd pass  on this one

I bought this vehicle for my son...we have been through 2 already...they do not work. The controller is not made very well...the two cars we bought did not respond..the first one you had to put the controller right up to the car to make it work...the other car would only go forward...and we tried this with brand new batteries and the charger pack we bought. Definitely a disappointment

The controller range is less than 40 feet.  This car is much too fast for the short range.  It is very easy to outrun the contoller.  There is also a delay between control input and vehicle response.  All batteries were new and fully charged, checked with a meter.  A scanner verified that nothing was causing frequency interference.  The older Tyco turbo cars had a 100 foot controller range and no delay.  Tyco apparently changed the design to the new digital control to allow multiple cars to run at the same time

I never imagined I was going to be such a bad experience, when you start the game is almost lost for the ones that chosen the light side. Then the game is complicated and it is not balanced, so everybody will choose the "dark side" because they have advantages. Dont waste you money buying this game, better buy the normal risk, acquire, or axes and allie

I have checked out almost every card shuffler in the market. And I can tell you that apart from the one made by Excalibur they are all the same, and Cardinal is not an exception. So here is my review.

This is the kind of gift you will give to someone you really, really hate. This thing does NOT shuffle plus it WILL eat up your cards badly. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE... that is unless you wish to annoy the hell out of someone and have fun doing so. If you do go ahead and spend your hard earn mula on this purchase, here are some suggestions on how you can use your brand new Card Shuffler. 

1. Pet Dog's Chew Toy 
2. Door Stop 
3. Play Street Hockey 
4. Stress Release Stomping Toy 
5. Mother-in-law Birthday Gift 
6. Modern Art for Coffee Table 
7. Nerf Ball Target Practice 
8. Condom Dispenser 

Kind of think about it, this is a great toy. Have fun! 

PS. If you are looking for a shuffler that really works maybe you should take a look at Excalibur Professional 6 Deck Card Shuffler; you might like it.

We were extremely disappointed with this toy that we bought as a Christmas present for our four year old son.  The parking garage came with pre-drilled holes and needed to be assumbled.  Unfortunately, due to poor quality, the pieces did not line up correctly and we needed to sand some of them down in order to make the toy functional.  It would also have been helpful for the manufacturer to include one or two spare screws in case they got lost or destroyed during assembly.

I had a problem with Brietta a day after I bought her. I was combing her hair, and suddenly her head broke! The part of her head that has hair seperated from her forehead, and there is no way to fix her. So she is stuck with a crack in her skull. I'm very upset about this.

Other than that, I adore my Brietta doll. She has long strawberry blond hair that curls at the end in a messy way, so I cut the hair shorter to get rid of the messy curls.  Her face has a gorgeous expression, which looks so friendly to me. Her gown is light pink with a real overskirt and long sleeves, and she has pink shoes that ACTUALLY STAY ON!

I'm just sad that she broke, but I still love her nonetheless

I ordered the ants in December (Christmas present), and although the temperatures were unseasonably warm here throughout January, no ants arrived. I have called several times, with the same excuse. They have my money and won't deliver the ants.
I would suggest any other company besides Uncle Milton Industries

The nose is glued and sewn on, but my baby still managed to chew it off.  I found it hanging by a thread from it's face one day.  So, cut off the nose before giving it to your baby, or never leave your baby alone with it once teething starts.

Too bad about the nose because my baby loves his puppytunes.

We baught a bunch of these fish for our 8 year old.We have a inground pool and thought they would be lots of fun!! Okay we took them out of the package, and had to rearrange the batteries 82 times before it would even respond to the water!!! When we placed it in the pool all it did was go on its side,in circles. Nothing was "realistic" about these things!!!! I should add that it was not just this one, but all of them!!!Do not waste your money or time buying these!!

I purchased this for myself and my 7 year old to play with. The screen is way too dark to be able to use at dusk or after, but if in direct sunlight, you can't see it either.
It's pretty small (buttons and screen) and a little confusing. If you are a person who is using hard earned money to purchase this, then don't. But if you just want to check it out and be okay with not wanting it later or losing the money you spent, go for it

My mom is an avid wheel of fortune fan, and for x-mas i thought i'd buy this for her since it reminded me of a wheel of fortune game we use to have. Man do i regret it. She NEVER plays it anymore. The puzzles are limited and will start to repeat within a few weeks. The keys on the keypad are hard to push in, and if you don't push it in right soon enough you lose your turn and the general game-play is blah. Really, if you bought this for someone, it's the kind of present that they'd be happy with for all of a few hours. Then they'd let it collect dust. Like my mum is =

My daughter was thrilled to see a new Wheel of Fortune game out and we bought it immediately! It's quite abit smaller than the original..can't imagine why they would do that..and it already has problems with the bonus round!  We may just have a bad one..but my daughter has gone back to using the 20 year old one she has..even with the faded screen and weak sound

I misunderstood the dimensions listed ( 7.5 x 1.5 x 10.5 inches ) and thought it would be large enough for my mother to see and handle. It isn't. Apparently, the dimensions include the packaging. She loves Wheel Of Fortune on TV, and I thought this game would be terrific therapy for her hands. Very disappointing. I'll be returning it, unopened.

We were so excited to order this item. Sadly the quality is very poor. We have had it set up for less than a week and the front "counter" has broken off and one of the front panels has had a leg rip off. My kids love the idea of this item but it is extremely flimsy particle type board -it has basically disintergrated berfore our eyes . Even with general play it sways back and forth, a little scary if little ones are playing in it.I am going to call the maker - hopefully we can repair this (...

This playhouse theater is an excellent way to spark your child's imagination.  My son received this as a Christmas gift last year and it has not only been a theater, but a house, cave, secret hideout, restaurant, and schoolhouse.  Very colorful and the front chalkboard is excellent for strenghtening writing skills!  The only downside I have with the theater is that it is not very durable.  The theater is made of some sort of flimsy plywood and it is not secured with screws, etc.  It slides together and a child can easily disassemble it.  The front panel that the child rest's his/her arms on broke after two weeks of having the theater.  Other than the durability factor...great product

My daughter got this for her 5th birthday, and it really looks cute and fun in the box.  Within 5 minutes of playing with it, the small clip that holds the starfish open broke.  In addition, the mermaids and other pieces that come with this toy are microscopic.  If your kids are like mine, they will lose the items and bug you all day to help them find it.  This toy is really cute, but not worth it.  Save yourself the hassle.  Buy the big barbies and pretend there is a big seashell to play in

I bought this oven for my children. After I lugged it home, my wife, an aspiring novelist, told me that "It was a quear, sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs, and I didn't know what I was doing in New York." I said "Don't you like the kid's new stove?" She replied, "How frail the human heart must be - a mirrored pool of thought. "

I left it at that, and cooked some macaroni and cheese for dinner, after a good cigar and a glass of Weller's, I came back into the kitchen, only to discover....well, that's a long story, I just hope you realize this ain't no kids stove, it's the real deal, bud. Chance rules every corner of the universe except the chambers of the human heart

If you want your child to know the true & Bibical account of Jesus' birth...the shepherds came first!
An angel announced His birth the shepherds hurried to see Mary, Joseph & baby Jesus.
They were first on the scene. Some chronicle the kings coming as much as three years later.
I will return my three sets & order the one with the bells & whistles AND two shepherds!!

this is not quite what I was expecting - I thought the mat was at least electronic or something to provide feedback, however it's just a plain cheap filmsy plastic mat that really adds nothing to the whole cheerleading experience.  Also, the video really moves too fast for my 4 yr old daughter and just up frustrating her.  It might work okay for older kids, but it's not very good for the younger ones

Product is average...

On ours the button whole is sewed so tight even I have problems buttoning... impossible for my 20 month old.  It says clothes remove fully and easily... which I thought would be great for my daughter since she likes to try and dress things... but the pullover has to be removed by pulling over the head and it isn't easy... and again is almost impossible for a little one.  Also... ours didn't come with a back pack which I'm sure would have made the toy more fun!  Perhaps she'll gain interest and capability with the toy in months to come... but right now... she has about as much interest in it as she does in say... carpet

I was very disappointed with the durability and time that it took to get this tent set up. It took me about 2 1/2 hours to assemble the tent and then once it was up it could never stay up. The joining brackets couldn't hold the poles together and everytime the tent was moved or touched it fell apart. I went inside the tent to put it back together and one of the poles fell straight down hitting me under the eye and cut it. This is why I am returning it. If it's not safe for me to be in then I certainly don't want my daughter playing in it

This toy needs work ... First of all, it's HEAVY!  My daughter (now 19 months) usually likes to pick it up and throw it.  After all, it IS a ball!  We have hardwood floors - throwing this ball is extremely loud and it can really do some damage to our floors!  We don't have any problems with it moving around ... however ... when you're asked to find something on the ball, even I have a hard time finding it to push the button in time.  So, I don't know how a 6 month+ baby/child could find the correct answer in time.

I think this is a nice idea for a toy, but it just doesn't work.  It is colorful, and my daughter does enjoy throwing it, but that's obviously not it's intended use.  She never played with this toy as a crawling infant.  She only plays with it now, and she only throws it.  Please don't waste your money on this toy.  It's not worth it

Yo Brannan, Relinquished does not fuse to or more monsters.  It lets you equip oppontents monsters to it.  Learn Yugioh you... error!!!  My favorite cards in pegasus deck are toon world, relinguished, and blue eyes toon dragon.  I gave the durability 2 stars because when you leave your cards in the sun in the car, they get in bad cond.  You know that annoying snap action.  The only thing i don't like like about pegasus deck is that theres not that many high attack monsters. I would reccomed deck protecters.  Also buy a kaiba evolution for megamorph.  In pegasus deck use seven tools of the bandit you lose 1000 LP.  Then use Toon World.  You lose another 1000 LP.  Special Summon Blue Eyes Toon Dragon.  Then use Megamorph.  6000 LP for your Toon Dragon.  Then use Toon Special ability.  Your opponent losses 6000 LP and he/she probobly will lose.  Lose 2000 LP with Seven Tools! Megamorph is worth it!!!!  Hope my review was helpful.  P.S. Brannan this is a good review.

Quick shipping on product but the product was not what I was hoping for.  The "snow" was much grainer than I had expected.  I had seen what I thought was the same item in stores during the holiday season and that "instant snow" was very fine and really looked like snow.  This product doesn't look much like snow and doesn't have the same texture

I was very happy to discover that I could purchase an Asian Cabbage Patch Girl doll...it was for a little Korean girl....the doll pictured on the website looked like the little girl that it was purchased for (the hair). Well, I was excited to find one and I wanted to make sure that I would receive it in time to wrap it and mail it to Texas in time for Christmas.  I ordered in on the 27th and received it on Dec. 1st (I paid for faster shipping).  When I opened the box it was an Asian doll but not the one with the ponytails...this doll had short hair.  I called Amazon immediately and although they expressed being sorry they said that they could not guarantee that it wouldn't happen again. I have used Amazon before with no problems but I am extremely unhappy with the bait and switch.  I should have read the other reviews.  I will never let that happen again.  BEWARE...do not order things of this nature from this website.  You will be disappointed

Got this for Xmas present for 2 year old. He loved it, but sounds and steam quickly stopped working with zero abuse. Incredibly cheap for a toy costing 40 bucks. This is just how to ruin a fan of the show. The folks who design such badly designed stuff should be ashamed of themselves. My son is important and deserves toys that can last more than two days

BUYER BEWARE!!!!
I recently ordered (December 15th, 2007) this product through Amazon filled by Joe Brands for my son for Christmas.  On Amazon's website it says you can cancel an order any time before it ships, if it does ship, you simply refuse receipt.  I canceled this order on December 16th less than 24 hours after I placed it, I called and emailed Joe Brands & emailed Amazon. Never the less the package arrives on December 22nd.  I called the shipping company, called and emailed Joe Brands, emailed Amazon and the package was finally picked up on the 27th of December.  The billing however has yet to be straighted out.  My credit card has yet to be credited, I do not have the product, and no one returns calls or emails.  BUYER BEWARE!!!

My husband and I have ignored many poor reviews in choosing toys for our 18-month old and have often been pleasantly surprised to see our son thoroughly enjoying such toys.  Unfortunately, this was not the case with the Peg Perego Thomas Ride-On train. He is exceptionally tall and strong for his age, yet there is no way his hand could possibly depress the button required to keep the train moving, much less hold it down for any length of time.  So the operation of the train requires an adult to depress the button and spin in circles while your child bats your hand away and is totally distracted from the experience.  My son enjoys pushing the train along the track more than riding it.  However, the train is flimsy and easily comes off the track, so this usually lasts a few seconds before he is again frustrated and annoyed.  All this and then you need to get out the screwdriver to charge the battery every time you  "play" with it.  Don't buy this toy or you will be kicking yourselves like we are.  It's a gimmicky piece of plastic junk that even major Thomas-lovers will probably not enjoy.

The start button is too difficult for even a three year old to hold down. The battery is tedious to re-charge (required after every use!). Dangerous. When child leans slightly to the side the entire engine will turn over. For all your time and money you will only see a child with a bored expression - or a frustrated child who can't operate start button alone. You could tape down the button and then the child must ask for you to stop it. Total supervision required any way you look at it. A real expensive, gimicky toy!

I was so disappointed with this item. My son (who's 3) received this for his bday. The child has to continuously hold down a button with his hand to keep the train moving and my son couldn't do it. He ended up getting so frustrated, he broke down in tears! The noises the train makes are MUCH TOO LOUD! And you need a lot of room in your home to set up the track, which we do not have. I was surprised at how poorly designed this was since it's a Peg Perego. The manufacturers should've really tried this one out on the recommended age group before they released it. Why couldn't there be a pedal to step on to make it go like every other ride-on toy for little ones? I put it back in the box and back to the store it went.

My five and half year old daughter asked for this particular barbie doll. She was so happy when she opened her present and found Mermaidia Elina doll. She took it out of the box and started to play with it. Soon enough she lost interest however. The wings are large, so large they are actually a burden. Placing the doll inside the mermaid tail is not easy for little hands either. All in all, this doll is just "make-up" if you see what I mean. Pretty but not easy to play with, and easily forgotten. She is on a stand in my daiughter's room, and hasn't been touched or played with since Christmas morning...

Not worth the price

I purchased this product along with the Koi and turtle and they worked for one day. The koi would not turn off unless the batteries were pulled out. The turtle would not turn on unless you physically held the button in and the fish just quit altogether and sunk to the bottom of the pool.

I bought this for my 5 year old and as another reviewer said....he would have to be double his size for it to fit (he wears a size 5-6)....and the items attached to it keep falling off.  We had to Duct tape it together to fit him because of course I would rather have returned it...but it was his favorite present!!!  It frustrates him a lot so I do not see him sticking with it!

I bought this for my son's fourth birthday because he's a superhero nut. It's a cute toy except for one critical flaw: it doesn't come anywhere near fitting around the waist of my average-sized 4-year-old (wears a size 4T). I'm talking about three inches of waist gap on even the smallest setting. Yet the belt can be adjusted to a size that would fit a teenager. If you have a 9-year-old who loves running around in a Batman costume, go for it. As for my 4-year-old, he still plays with it sometimes, but we keep it on him with a pair of firefighter's suspenders.

Update: The thick plastic of the belt is now ripped halfway apart. We've only had it two months, and he's hardly played with it for the abovementioned reasons. Not so great for Batman, but perfect for playing Super Chintzy Toy Man

My son (now 4) loves cars, so when I saw this bed frame, I thought this is it!  Well, looks can fool you.  I also read many glowing reviews about this bed frame, so I was confident that this was a MUST buy.  But after using it for a while (1 year now), I am very disappointed.  If I would buy another bed frame, this one would not be in my shopping list.

What I and all my family don't like about this frame :
1.  The front end of the car frame is shaped like a sports car, so people hit that protruding part all the time when walking in the room, making people falter sometimes.

2.  Since it is made of plastic, it gets really cold, and it really feels terrible.  I don't know why it is damn cold all the time.  

3.  I had to exchange the regular-height box spring for a half-height one, because the regular-height box spring would be too high and the sides of the bed frame would not provide adequate protection against falling.

4.  So many toys and things fall between the mattress and the bed frame.  I have to lift the damn mattress and then go into the car frame to pick up all the junk that my son loves to shove into the little openings.

5.  I think the bed frame takes up way too much space for a twin sized bed.  It is waste of space.

6.  My son was disappointed that the wheels don't spin.  And I think he has a point, since this bed frame costs so much.  My son now don't even think it's a cool thing.  Well, he stopped liking the bed only after a few days.

7.  The head part of the bed is also plastic, and for some reason, your head can go under that plastic, because that head part comes over the mattress.  It is quite annoying, and we had to put another pillow to cover that part of the frame.  And you can't even use it as a shelf since it is not flat.  Dolls and little toys that we put up there would slide down to hit our son or slide to the sides and fall into the corner where there is a big opening between the walls and the car frame.

8.  Again, it is very very cold, and it really feels terrible when you want to sleep at night and everything around you is so cold and hard.

This is a miserable bed, and I feel bad that I bought this horrible bed for my loving son.  We are gonna sell it for 100 dollars (we hope) in the summer.

The only reason for giving 2 stars is because, it is very solid

all non-yellow parts of the ducks are painted and come off pretty easily. a little moisture and some teeth for a minute can remove paint.  this toy is best for those who are past placing toys or anything in their mouth. I still think they are cute and a great idea...just need to be made better/safer

The wooden Thomas the Tank Engine trains do not fit in this case.  The case is way to small for the trains to fit in.  I would not recommend anyone buying this item.  It is just a brightly painted metal box, that doesnt serve any useful purpose.  The manufactor should be ashamed for false advertising.

My son received this as a gift.  I love that the inside is set up like "shelves".  My son loves to organize his trains in it.  I don't like how thin the metal is.  It dents as easy as a cola can.  If it were made better, it would be worth the money.  Save your money on this one and find something better made

This game has zero replay value. Once you play the three episodes, you're done. Each run through of each episode is the same. Played through the entire disc in an hour and half. My advice: Spend a few dollars more and get Scene It!

i bought this thinking it was going to be really cool, but it was very boring and stupid.  it contains 3 puzzles all of which a 5 yr old can do and the games are the most stupid games ever.  the one with the spinner only shows the objects on the puzzle move smaller as you look at it.  thats the whole thing.  your pupil is just going back to its smaller, regular size and it makes the picture look like it's getting smaller.  and the one with the magic cards is rediculous.  anyone can see that all you have to do is choose the cards that you can see the character you chose through.  very disapointing.  i wish i could have seen the box before i bought it.  then i would have seen just how lame this was

My daughter plays with an older round version sit and spin at daycare alot. All the kids like it there. She got the Simon Says version for Christmas from her aunt and it pretty much sucks. She tried to play with it every once in a while but got so frustrated we have now just put it the attic because she won't touch it and it was in the way. It doesn't spin very well at all (possibly due to the oval shape??) no matter where my daughter sits on it. Also the audio is very loud and annoying with no volume control. Also it seems much cheaper made than the older style she plays with at daycare. I would say DON'T waste your money on the Simon Says Sit n Spin - try to find an older one at a second hand store or garage sale. My recommendation to Playskool would be to go back to the original design - a round sit n spin, no sound - just pure and simple fun

I can see from reading the below reviews that I'm not the only one who hates this thing. What a total waste! I got it for my little one, remembering how much I (and every other kid I've ever known) loved this toy. Well, this version has been made too safe to have any fun on. It barely spins. If you want your toddler to develop amazing upper body strength, then force them to work out on this thing a couple times a day. It's almost impossible to spin and you never get up any momentum at all. Not to mention the loud loud music with no volume control. Which I could deal with if the thing was any fun at all

We bought this gadget for our 2-year old. To risk sounding like a broken record--or faulty spinning plastic toy, in this case--I'll just add my vote to the design flaws: 
1. Volume. Not only is the volume loud, it's unbearably so. Even my daughter grabs her ears when she's playing on it. The voice is a bit garbled as well, so when the command 'Ready..Spin!' sounds more like 'Wordy...SPEW!' I prefer to spare my daughter's hearing loss for live concerts in her teenage years, so I've disabled the on/off switch. 
2. Spin quality. A Sit n' Spin should have a fluid, effortless motion (like a lazy susan). This toy requires enormous effort to turn. To add to my daughter's frustation, the handle's base gives a bit (even with screws tightly fastened), making for a tedious experience rather than the joy ride we loved as kids. 

Spare the expense and the frustration of fitting this thing in the garbage can on collection day--buy an easel and finger paint kit instead.

My two year old absolutely would not leave the store without this and she still plays with it a year later. However, there are two problems. One, it immediately needed repair to the basic connections and, two, it has a pinching hazard between the basket and the frame. But of course, my daughter never noticed either of those. She simply loves to play with it, constantly, and has to take it on walks around the block

The features on this toy are cute, just not planned out very well.  My boys love the music and bubbles, but the micky and goofy that go up and down on the sides broke off after a couple days.  The voice recorder is very hard to work because of a short cord. For a ride on my boyslike the radiio flyer retro rocket more.  Overall, in our house this is a bubble machine.

A friend of mine has Zombies!!!, also by Twilight Creations.  I've played it a few times, and found it pretty enjoyable.  

Zombietown is sort of a followup to this in some ways, and tries to expand the strategy of the game somewhat.

Unfortunately, it ends up far too confusing and complicated to make for fast gameplay (it's often very slow, in fact), and the strategy is more shallow than Risk.  

Ya know the stereotypically confusing instructions of insert Tab A into Slot B?  That's pretty much what the instructions to this read like.  They're fairly poorly written to boot.  There were also a couple problems we ran into the rules didn't seem to cover.  I can't recall them off the top of my head, and they didn't come up very often, but it was still irritating.

Overall, definetly not reccomended.  At $40 in stores, and $35 off Amazon, it's also a HUGE ripoff.  What do you get in the box?  Like 100 tiny army men-esque figures, a couple of packs of cards, and a laminated piece of cardboard.  I understand why it is expensive, as I'm sure this was a low budget item and such, but Zombies!!! was much less expensive.

If rating a &quot;no star&quot; was possible, that's what it really deserves.  I bought this for my two year old twin boys and as I was inflating it - with a handpump - it blew at the seams!  Beyond patching!  Unfortunately they never even knew that they had it.  I would not buy it again because of the quality of the product.  How can kids be safe jumping on something that blows out when being pumped by a hand pump???  That's like blowing it up by mouth!

I got this on clearance like 2 years ago. I new it would not hold up. I had many kids on it because I do home daycare. My rule was only 3 kids at a time. The bigger kids could only go on 2 at a time. It got 3 holes which I patched. They even took naps in it. I must of had It for about 6 months and only keep it up for like a week at a time. My problem was it was hard to store. I had to leave it inflated some and pushed it in back of my closet. Finaly one of the big kid did a big belly flop on it and popped the seem. No way was that fixable. If I ever find it on clearance again I would buy it but not for what they are asking for it. Not worth it if it will break in a couple of months

We bought this for our 3 year old daughter for Christmas.  We turned it on right away and she was very excited until the sound suddenly started to fade out.  We thought it was just a case of dead batteries, so we replaced the batteries - several times - until we realized the product was just bad.  When trying to get it replaced, we were told they were out of stock and our money would be refunded instead.  Needless to say, our daughter was very sad and we will not be buying this product anywhere, ever.  We'll just stick with another type of keyboard to help our daughter develop a love of music

Christmas morning, my daughter tears the paper off this toy and is soooo exited. What a disapointment. Nothing I did caused the tail to wag, the leg to move and no licking action. I changed the batteries, still nothing. After hours of trying to get it to work, I went on line here and read somebody elses review about rubbing under the collar VERY HARD. Finally, the tail wagged, the foot moved and then, it actually licked. What a piece of work, very cute but WAY too much work. In time, I will eventually rub all the fur off under the collar. Save your money

I support the comments that others make: this game is so poorly designed, it is laughable. I cannot imagine that the designers or writers even sat down to play the game once.  Forget trying to follow the directions; they left out many important rules.  The board doesn't work, especially the way the pieces fit into it, and what a terrible ending with a spinner that doesn't even work like a spinner.  What is up with that?  Forget this game

Well, this game is fun but I can't believe some people thought that it would actually take you into space!
Well, Its kinda stupid you just take apart a house puzzle according to some stupid card. But still, the game is really fun.

We bought this dollhouse, because when we went to the store, it had an adorable display and looked like a step up from the Twintime Dollhouse, which has very small rooms.  You could press the button on the display, and the people would talk to each other.  My kids thought it would be great.  When we were at Toys R Us, I looked for accessory furniture/people/animal sets to go along with this dollhouse.  I did not see any.  I thought it was probably due to Christmas just having passed.  We got home, opened the dollhouse and discovered that there really were not many phrases that the provided people/furnitureanimal did, so I went to Amazon to try to find more sets in order to achieve the purpose of this dollhouse (to get the 200 phrases). Thats when reality set in that we had just made a huge mistake.  You cannot find ANY accesory pieces for this set.  You can go on Ebay and pay many times more than the original price for USED furniture.  I was really disappointed.  I even tried the Fisher Price website, only to find that they are marketing the Twintime Dollhouse furniture for this Sweet Sounds Dollhouse.  What a shame and a sham....  I really like Fisher Price toys and we have many, but I am very disappointed in the fact that they are trying to fool the consumer.  What good is a dollhouse, if you cannot get it to accomplish what it says it will do---200 phrases.  Not to mention, what is included with the Sweet Sounds Dollhouse is not much.  Just a Mom, Dad, girl, baby, swing, cradle, radio, cat, and a scant few more pieces.  Definately not enough to keep the kids interested for long!

There are actually three Fisher Price dollhouses that are still available, this one, the Twintime Dollhouse, and the one we eventually ended up buying at Value City (also available on Ebay)--the Fisher Price Special Edition Townhouse.  It has a doorbell that rings, doors that open, birds that sing, phone that rings, lights that come on, fridge light comes on, computer lights up(and is part of a desk set attached to the dollhouse), and a fireplace that crackles and lights up (which is also attached to the dollhouse).  These things are all ON THE DOLLHOUSE itself.  No accesory furniture or people are needed to make this happen.  The battery replacement compartment is on the back on this dollhouse not the bottom, like the Sweet Sounds one.  The front of the Townhouse has flower boxes with likelike flowers you place in them (comes with the set).  You can get it A LOT cheaper than the Sweet Sounds Dollhouse, too (almost half the cost). It comes with a great deal of furniture:  2 beds with pillows and comforters and blankets, a lawnchair, 3 people, potted plant, real curtains, kitchen table and chairs, clothing for the people, computer chair, lounge chair and more.  The kitchen counter, stove, microwave and fridge are part of the dollhouse.  It also has closet doors that open and stairs the people can walk up.  You practically do not need to buy anything else, but if you do, you can get the Loving Family accesory people and furniture sets.  This dollhouse is so much larger to boot.  There is plenty of room to put everything. It shuts and closes together just like the Sweet Sounds, but it is clearly larger.  We also thought about the Twintime, but it had too many comments on how small the rooms were and the display at Toys R Us looked jammed packed.  I did not know how more than one child could play with it and not have a shoving match, because they could not play, as well.

My kids absolutely the Townhouse with all of its sounds, especially the doorbell.  The great thing about it is that these are greatly reduced in price, because they are an older model, which is what they should do with the Sweet Sounds Dollhouse.  Let the public know ahead of time, so their kids do not get disappointed, because it does not live up to what it says at the store. Thank Goodness I was able to take mine back, because I had my receipt and box.  Be careful and keep the box and receipt if you do choose to buy this dollhouse even after all of the warnings, because after your kids see that it does not do what it says and because it is on the small side compared with the Townhouse version, they may not want to keep it. When we took ours back, a Toys R Us worker stopped and talked to us and agreed that Fisher Price is just trying to get rid of their extra stock of Sweet Sounds Dollhouses. Unfortunately, it is at the consumers expense and disappointment!!

My 5 yr. old son got this for Christmas and played with it only while we where watching (so we know he didn't do anything to break it).  The day after Christmas morning it stopped working...we changed the batteries that came with it and still it made noise but no longer would the shovel go up and down nor would it go in reverse.  I bought this from Toys R Us in our hometown.  I  threw the box away on Christmas day so I can't take it back.  I will try calling the company.

I'm sure this would be a fun toy, but for us it didn't last long enough to find out.  We had this in our pool for 5 minutes and one of the guns stopped working.  The boys were very disappointed! 
I will be taking this back to the store tonight and try to exchange it with a new one that hopefully works

This is a very cute set however, it's not very well made and the holders are free-standing so when a ball knocks against it they fall over.  In regular croquet the wires are pushed into the ground so you don't have that problem.  With kids . . . the stands are knocked over frequently so you have to run over and set them back up in order for the game to continue.  I wouldn't buy this set again if I had it to do over.  Disappointing

I bought this for my daughter when she was 2. I agree with the other reviewer about the weight of the product. It is so heavy that it can actually hurt a child if it turns over. I still let my daughter play with it but only when she's being supervised around it. And I have to make sure that the toy is not on any type of unstable ground. There are other good shape sorters out there - I wouldn't waste the money on this one because of the potential safety hazard.

We bought this toy and returned it as it is poorly designed.  Because it is tall and narrow, once a few blocks are in it, it is nearly impossible to get any of the shapes in the lowest holes as the space inside the building is filled with blocks already.  This was a frustrating, not very fun toy for our then 12 month old son

The first time I "flew" the chicken it flopped 2 feet in front of me.  The second time it went about 6 feet.  The third time it decapitated!  I was left with a piece of stuffed chicken in each hand.  Unless you are accomplished at disassembling and reassembling stuffed animals, it is not repairable.  

Save your money for something else

I'm sorry no as a matter of fact I am not sorry this doll looks like she can be in three six mafia video dancing in the background. Who told Mattel that this was a good idea? Is this Mattel's vein attempt to give the dolls an "urban" feel if Mattel feels this is appropriate to teach young girls to dress like ho's and teach them that their body is all that they have to offer then Mattel has some messed up views of the world. Honestly people this doll is not innocent looking it looks like it could be on that HBO documentary about hookers. What happened to the times when a kid could be a kid and play with a normal looking doll.

We like the lunchbox because of the cute designs,but were a little disappointed in it's durability. The first time I dropped it on the ground,it scratched off parts of the design. So,mom did some creative thinking and did some touch up paint and sealed the design with "self laminating sheets". That did the trick. We also wished the thermos and lunchbox were insulated. Other than that, it's o.k

My son is a Thomas fanatic.  This lunchbox didn't last one week without one of the legs snapping off, so it wouldn't stand up.  Then a few weeks later, he dropped it and the handle shattered.  Total waste of money.  It's a shame - it has a nice storage box in front, but the quality is below even what I'd expect from a Chinese sweatshop

The box was a huge hit with my 4 year old and he LOVED the extra, "hidden" compartment for his treat on the front.  Ours however got a crack in it within the first few weeks.  It must have dropped just right on a corner.  It's still usable, but we'll probably be switching before Christmas break

I would not suggest the purchase of this product as you will only get a few laughs before it starts falling apart to a useless stage.  If you have the money, and you want to buy it go ahead.  Maybe it's a great product and I just got a defective one, but still not a good show of product to me on their part

Just about everything negative that can be said about this doll has been said here, but I still feel that I have to put my two cents in.  My daughter will be nine next month and, as always, she wants a Barbie doll for her birthday.  This is one doll that not only will my daughter NOT be getting, but one that she will never even see if I can help it.  Little girls love things that are shiny and sparkly and glitzy, but this doll goes way beyond that.  The doll looks like a [...].  The clothes and makeup just do not make sense in any other context.  Yes, it's just a doll, and it's the parent's responsibility--not the toy company's--to teach kids what is okay and what isn't.  But do you want your sweet little girl looking at this and imagining how pretty she will look one day in a crotch-length skirt?

This is a new low, even for our feminazi-drenched anti-culture.  The whole message of this whore of a doll is to tell impressionable little girls that being superficial, arrogant, shallow and slutty are positive attributes, desirable & healthy, and that by contrast, having true strength of character, integrity, honor and modesty are for 'losers.'  In other words, looking and behaving like a skank tramp = "empowerment."  That term has been SO misued over the last 30 years (and particularly the last 10), that it ceases to have any truth to it whatsoever.  Barbie used to epitomize what it meant to be feminine, a lady, and fulfilled -- with a husband, a home and children.  Now that standard has been completely perverted and ruined with the onset of dolls like this -- exchanging true values (being a good wife and mother) for false ones (materialism and promiscuity).  Even Barbie's face has been uglified -- grossly overdone mascara/eyeliner and collagened-out lips -- resembling those hideous whored-out Bratz dolls.  Realize -- this is a WAR on our children's souls!

Mattel should be ashamed of themselves, to the hilt.  This is child abuse, pure and simple.  Any mother who allows their child to get one of these monstrosities should be jailed for neglect and have her tubes tied

Isn't Barbie supposed to be pretty? She looks like an ugly prostitute, hands down. I wouldn't "wear that to a club" and neither would ANY of my friends. Her make up is gross, and especially the look on her face says, "Do me now." There's a difference between beauty and over-the-top trashy. You can't deny that she looks like a porn-star, which is an industry that is illegal for teenagers who get this doll to participate in, but I guess we're preparing our youth for this at a younger age now

Ever wonder what drives someone's daughter to go into porn? This has got to be some of the most irresponsible marketing ever. Please do yourself a favor and make sure toy companys get the message to stop peddling this type of garbage

Ok, I don't have this doll, I won't buy this doll...If I ever have a little girl she will never have anything like this. I saw some girls saying how the doll was appropriate for 10-13 and I almost fell out of my chair! This doll is -IN-appropriate for someone under 21! The short skirts the short tops. How the heck can Mattel think that this was a good idea? I'm 23 years old and I would NEVER dress like that NOR would I allow my CHILD to dress like that. Bottom line: SHAME ON YOU MATTEL!!

This is pretty much kid vs kid only.  Adults cannot play along.  You can make it into a solo game for one child, but its really more like flash cards for spelling if you do that.  

The product is basically a set of flash cards for spelling, with some letter cubes for the kids to spell out the words.  The rules propose two games, which are basically see if the kids spells the word right, they get to keep the card if they do, first kid with 5 cards wins.  Adults can pretend to play along if the child is younger and will "fall for it."  It really works as a game only if there are two kids the same age playing.

I don't know, but I can't see my daughter pulling this out when a friend comes over.  Therefore, to the extent this is a set of flash cards for spelling, its kind of expensive for what it is.

Don't get me wrong, you can definitely make it into a learning tool.  Your call.

Toy makes EXTREMELY loud animal noises, along with a screeching motor when backing up or at top speed going forward.  My son enjoyed the heck out of it for about 2 minutes before my wife said it was going back to the store, which is exactly what I was thinking.

At least 3-4x louder than any other toy i've ever seen, let alone purchased.

Also when performing its "flip" maneuver, it gets stuck 70% of the time and then makes the same screeching motor sound while it repeatedly tries to reset its "flip arm".

Might be okay for just outside use if you can stand a lot of high pitched noise.

Controller was extremely toddler friendly compared to other RC toys.  Toy also seemed fairly tough.

I bought this for my 4 year old grandson for Christmas.  We opened it up and sat on the floor and began putting it together.  He was excited because he is a Lighting McQueen fan.  He got about four pieces of it together and got very frustrated.  It would not stay together.  THE PUZZLE IS JUNK!!!!!!!!  The pieces are not flat and do not interlock so that they stay together.  He lost interest and left.  I finished it enough so that they were laying together to see the picture - which is very cute.  But, no way would they ever all fit together.  Do not waste your money on this.  I also had to retape the corners of the box, as they were all coming apart too.  Yea for cheap imports.  The USA is so much better off for them???????

a waste of my hard to come by money--- I am on a fixed income and bought this item for my 10 month old grandson for Christmas. Really a disappointment, good idea-BUT he can't even hear the animal sounds because they are so low..... If I could have taken it away from him, I definitely would have returned it for a refund!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Big disappointment. Cheaply made. T-rex model does not snap together, can not even fit together as parts are improperly molded.  Microscope less functional than a magnifying lens.  Volcano is ok, the plaster does work, but you must provide ingredients for the eruption.  Weather center very very flimsy and breaks.  I was quite surprised a name like Smithsonian would be associated with this low of quality in a product.  Supplies for crystals subpar for what is required.  Was an enormous disapointment after the holidays for my sons.

I have to agree with the first two comments.   We went to check it out after my 4 year old saw it on TV and liked it because the bear had glasses just like him. The product seemed decent in the store, so we bought it. He has only played with it once or twice since Christmas. The only time he had fun with it was when I got mad and yelled at the thing because it wouldn't do what it is supposed to.  SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DON'T BUY THIS JUNK

I bought this for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas.  She played the sound game.  She always got the answer correct, but 60-70% of the time the bear still said it was incorrect.  The rest of the family tried it and it did the same thing.  Therefore, this is not a learning toy and it is no fun.  After trying a few times and the bear telling my daughter she was incorrect when she actually was, she decided she hated the thing and didn't ever want to play with it again.  I took the thing back to the store and got a refund

I bought this with high hopes of getting a well modeled vehicle. It took about only ten minutes to put together, and it comes with General Greivous!!! But, the legs are really weird. I wasted $20.00 dollars at a local super target I could have got a star wars video game or a few figs..... I just like adding it to my collection. But, if you have the Obi-Wan with Boga, put them together like I did. 

The Star Wars saga has introduced some really good toys, I am just saying that this toy is fairly good. Not a favorite. I suggest it to a collecter only........

I love the line of E3 collectables. They really rock. I suggest this because it is okay in the stage of durable and fun. Star Wars E3 General Greivous' wheel bike is a great toy I hope people should think about buying

This is more for a kid who is 4 or 5 years old NOT 8-11 as it states.
Talk about a waste of money. I returned this the next day for a refund as my 10 year old daughter would have been so upset with me had she received this under the Christmas tree this year.
It was a shame the description wasn't more accurate, because I was not refunded my expedited shipping costs I paid for this "TOY"

Just what the world needs, another clone of the worst board game ever to sell like hotcakes. 

I can not think of any reason to recommend this game. The winner is determined by luck, there is no skill involved in winning this or any game of monopoly. The game hardly fits into a single evening of play, and for a few unlucky players who exit early that means either sitting around watching or finding something else to do (This may be a blessing if it means not playing anymore). 


So to anyone who is buying this to play it (not because you are a huge dog fan and must own everything that has a dog on it) I recommend that you look into a better product. 

I would start by going to Google and searching on "board game". Follow the 1st link you find

I bought this for my 7 year old son. It did not take long before the A and B buttons became stuck in the down position. The games were not that challenging for a 7 year old. But he thought it was great when the A and B buttons fouled up, he said it made it more of a challenge. Dad thinks the thing is a piece of crap

I purchased this for my sons birthday this year. He is three. He was so excited to have the play tent but when I took it out of the box and started to put it together I noticed the stitching was not straight and missing in some places. It took him no more than 24 hours to brake it. The plastic supports and cheap fabric were horrible. There was also a center support pole with no place to put it. He likes it but the quality craftmanship was a ZERO.

I bought this for my pony-obsessed daughter for Christmas, mostly because it was the only way to get the Breezie "Zipzee" (one of the main Breezies in the new movies). Thank goodness I wasn't expecting much out of this toy after reading reviews on the other playsets, because it didn't even last a day! After I assembled the "braiding" handle and my daughter quickly learned how to operate it herself, she came out not an hour later in tears because it had fallen apart. Not the handle you snap on, mind you. That was still firmly attatched. The rest of the mechanism had more or less disintegrated as she used it! Fortunately she gets enough use out of Zipzee and Daffidaisy that it wasn't too much of a loss that I had to throw it away only hours after opening the box.  So, unless you're really after Zipzee or Daffidaisy, don't waste your money on this junky thing that could potentially be a choking hazaard for younger siblings. Horrible!!

I bought this as a Christmas present for my 4-year-old daughter.  She is a huge My Little Pony fan.  Ponyville lives in our house in fact.  We got it out and played with it for a couple hours.  We didn't have the problems described with the hand crank.  That seems to be very durable.  The problem is with the flower that Zippee goes in.  A pony steps on the flower to open the flower and then you wind the gear counter clockwise to close it.  

After a couple hours, the flower petals are now broken and can't be repaired.  Toys certainly don't have the quality in them that they used to.  Hasbro's quality in general has declined.  This was demonstrated in the newest My Little Pony Castle as well.

This toy has some neat features.  The crank works well and the braiding mechanism is useful.  The Breezie that lives in the flower goes along with the story in the My Little Pony video series.  The colors are vivid and bright.  I would have liked to suggest that the pink stage that the Daffidazey stands on should have had built-in storage to hold the hair accessories.  Some additional clips would also have been a nice addition to this set.  4 clips for a set that is designed to do all your ponies' hair is a bit skimpy.  The braids are nice and tight and even a young child can operate this toy....with a bit of assistance.  (Hint:  Putting suction cups or velcro hook and loop on the bottom makes it even easier for little ones to play with minimal adult assistance)

this spins so fast that none of the paint comes out- then it just pours out in a big wet mess.

We bought this for my daughter for her birthday.  Like the previous reviewer we also didn't realize we needed to dilute the paint first.  Even with the paint diluted properly it doesn't really work as expected.  You have to wait for the paint to drip down to the bottom of the tube and then turn the spinner on.  Even then only a bit of paint comes out and you have to turn it off and wait for more to drip down.  I plan on returning this toy for a refund as well.

I bought this product for my children because it looked neat!  What they don't tell you is that the paint must be diluted before you can use it (why not include the pre-diluted paint?  But I digress....).  Even after thinning the paint, the product hardly spins.  If we could get it to work, it seemed like a neat concept.  But it just doesn't work.  I have no idea if it is because it needs very thin paint or the motor is weak or what.  We returned ours for a refund

I purchased this item for my 5 year old daughter who loves Barbie.  It is a simple game, but maybe a little too simple.  She got bored with it really fast.  She played it once and never again.  The board was very flimsy and not made well

I am very disappointed with this product.
The volume is not adjustable, and the default sound setting is so loud that it can be heard in another room, even with a door closed. 

Electronic toy voices are occasionally annoying or difficult to understand, this is the case here. So, needing to have something repeated... loudly... can "get on your nerves".

I will be more careful in the future and not assume that all speaking electronic toys come with adjustable volume.
Buyers beware!

My stepmom bought a set of these for each of my three kids ages 12, 9, and 6. All I have to say is do not buy these!!!! My six year old did great on the first page but as the other reviewer said the film gets all over the markers. we even tried washing them off and it did no good. Also when my 6 year old was coloring he would rest his arm on the bottom of the page and when he would pick it up it would be covered in black. Bottom line about 30 minutes after they got them my kids arms and faces were COVERED in black smudges as were my hands somewhat just from holding their pictures to look at them. MESSY MESSY MESSY.  My 12 year old finally just went and stuck one of the papers under running water and washed off all the black to see the neon underneath and this proved to be the least messy but least rewarding way to do it. Good idea bad execution. My kids who are crazy for any kind of arts and crafts HATED these things. Save your money and buy regular papers and markers and crayons

My son loves the Color Wonder line by Crayola, so when I saw that they came out with a new creation called Color Explosion, which is another marker-type of product, I knew I had to try it.  Now, I wish I'd saved my money.

First off, you should know this product is not for preschoolers.  Color Explosion is recommended for children 6-years and up.  Now that I've played with it, I concur.  I came upon this product when arrangements were made to watch my 9 and 10-year old nieces for a week.  I thought the Color Explosion would be a hit, and I planned to treat them with this "art" related project throughout the week.  They were excited to try it, and once I settled Monkey Boy, my 5-year old, with a project of his own, we got started.  

At first glance, it looked to be a winner.  The girls were having fun.  Then, we started another page, and the markers became icky.  Gummy is probably a better description.  The markers were covered with a black film, which caused the images to look splotchy, and streaky.  Crayola suggests you wipe the markers off with a paper towel, so we did.  It kept happening.  For instance, we'd draw a short line, and then we'd have to wipe the film off again.  Then, we tried to wipe off the images with a paper towel.  That didn't help either.  

Color Explosion is too painstaking for a child's activity.  We began to realize that it wasn't a blast, but a bummer.  Crayola warns against moisture, but even fingerprints will spear the pages, and the film comes off onto your hands, the table, and everything else.  Oh, and if you use the glitter set, it clumps, and mixes with the film, and makes a liquidy black goo that stains fabrics.  The company warns about staining, and suggests washing immediately, but come on.  Did they even test market this product?  What I thought would be an entertaining venture, turned out to be a messy disappointment.

I bought this toy along with Mr. Incredible for my son's birthday.  He loves the movie and was very excited to get these toys.  Unfortanitly, they lasted all of five minutes before Syndromes head fell off, and Mr. Incredibles hand broke off.  After that I had to deal with a crying kid.  If you want the toy just to look at, then it is good, but if you buy it for your child,don't expect it to last long

 To start with, the description of this kit is false. There are NOT 75 pieces... only 11. The detail is VERY, VERY poor... large soft-edged raised blocks with only the vaguest resemblance to the Death Star as seen in the films. You'd honestly be better off starting with a smooth plastic ball & making a Death Star from scratch, rather than buying this kit.

As Star Wars kits go, it's better than most. Ertl should have spent more time on the molds and getting the details right. 

The kit, while having very few parts, is not a novice kit. It has fit issues and badly &#65279;mis-aligned parts. The upper and lower fuselages do not mate well and the solar panels do not align well with the hull. The solar panels tend to cant to the rear, not setting in line with the fuse.

It's a case of both of the parts, the solar panels and the fuselage being out of alinement. Much work is needed to get the solar panels to aline with the hull and the mounting pylons.

One bright spot is the well defined, engraved panel lines and the small details. The upper hatch and cockpit glass is the clearest of the Star Wars kits I have built. 

It's better than the X-Wing and other fighters and is as good in the detail department as the AT-AT. Having not built the rare Tie Fighter kit, I cannot say how it rate against it.

Once the fit problems are dealt with, and a good paint job is applied, it makes a good display, but it requires some modeling experience to get it to look as it should. The stand is not sturdy enough for the weight of the model. I suggest a clear plastic rod and a wooden base

This product is a box o' junk.  My son got this for Christmas this year and it is not even worth whatever the person paid for it.  The hat fell apart within three days (and he hardly played with it - just wore it on his head a few times) - the metal rim around the hat came undone and now there is a sharp metal point sticking out through the cloth on the hat, which is obviously dangerous.  I contacted the company and they have not responded.

The Barbie Plug and Play 12 Dancing Princesses thing is a joke.  My daughter only wanted that for Christmas for three months.  After the one on Christmas morning did not function at all, the second one was so terrible that she gave up after two days.  The graphics are straight from 1981 and the "dancing princesses" even make roboty bendy noises as they move.  Very strange and disappointing

I wouldn't even give this toy one star if I wasn't forced to.  Mattel should be ashamed of themselves for putting out a product with 1980's graphics and even worse sound.  It sounds like my husband's 1985 Casio watch.  The only thing they did well with this product is market it.  I gave this to my daughter from Santa and I am still going to return it.

I have to agree with the other on here. I got this for my 5yr for christmas and She seemed to enjoy it the first day using it but now It sits in her room plugged into the tv and she hasnt really gotten much use out of it. I was thinking it was going to be more of a mat where you learn to dance from the mat, not oh watch the charaters on the tv and follow thier lead. I tried and didn't think it was all that fun either. I threw the box away and I'm sure I need that to return it. If I could I would get her something else in return that she could use

Again, the graphics are horrible, the mat is boring and not colorful. My 3 1/2 yr old had a hard time matching the colors on the tv to the ones on the mat b/c they are so faded. She used it once and it has been sitting in the corner ever since...complete waste of money

This was very dissapointing!! my daughter was so excited to get it and could barely use it. the mat is supposed to be color coordinated with the screen however the colors seem to be all the same shade. The mat looks like it comes from the dollar store, or they ran out of color at the factory. My daughter asked her sister why mommy got this ugly one....not like the box or commercial!

Santa gave this to our daughter this year.  I am thoroughly disappointed with it.  We put the batteries in and started it up.  After reading the how to part, the graphics are terrible.  I had to prompt her to which flower to step on, not that that was necessary.  The princesses started dancing without stepping on the flower, it just made a funny sound.  The dancers go fast and fuzzy.  You can't tell for sure what the foot work is doing for the ballroom steps.  I even went on the mat and "tried."  My daughter lasted all of about five minutes and was done.  I hope Santa will take this back

My daughter just received this as a Christmas gift.  She was so excited.  My husband and mother-in-law went to the tv to install it.  15 minutes later my five year old is in tears.  I wish this had been reviewed before we purchased.  The graphics are terrible.  This will be going back to the store.  Glad I still have the receipt.

Like many overhead gym type toys, this one turns out to be for short or legless babies. When my daughter kicks the kickplates, she kicks the toy right away from her (and this is on carpet), and when we brace the toy against something, she kicks herself right out from under the toy. We have found the same to be true for a number of similarly designed toys. Now that we have looked at the box more closely, the baby in the picture has his/her legs bent really hard in order for the baby to fit under the toy. Our daughter is 3 1/2 months old and is already too big for this. On a positive note, this is a very well made toy in all other respects. Looks durable, as are all Chicco toys, and the music and lights are pleasant. Another negative: you apparently have to push the two hanging toys to get them to activate sound and lights, and most babies want to pull them. Might be good for a tummy toy, but we're not waiting for that--we'll try the Chicco 3 in 1 gym instead, as it appears to be a much better bang for the buck and does not have a kick plate

It's Christmas Day, and believe me, the only thing that would get me to sit down at a computer is the level of dissatisfaction I've had with the Thomas battery powered engines.  These trains derail constantly.  I think it is because all four wheels have power, and the front wheels have too much traction, so they are able to climb out of the grooves.  Took me all night to set up a really cool track, and they derail every 40 seconds or so.  Read: 3 year old yelling at train.  Thank goodness I also bought a Brio battery powered engine as well (the Polar Express one).  It works much better.  It has not derailed once all morning.  It also is better in the following ways: 1) It shuts off after 2 minutes so you don't lose battery power, 2) it can go into freewheel mode when you want to use it without power, 3) it goes in reverse, 4) it makes train sounds, 5) the coupling to other cars has a swivel which means it is less likely to derail and more likely to maintain the magnetic connection, 6) it comes with batteries installed.  If "Santa Claus" had not disposed of all the packaging last night, I would return all the battery operated Thomas Trains and go with Brio ones.  Note: there is a good thomas battery powered car which is the jet engine.  This jet engine has the swivel, and seems not to derail, maybe because it pushes the other cars in front of it

 This kit is very poorly detailed, and matches the filming miniatures only in the sense of the basic overall profile being pretty close.

 There's a MUCH better model of an X-Wing out there. Do a web search for a company called "Fine Molds"... it's a Japanese company that makes a finely-detailed 1/72 scale X-Wing that is modeled directly from the filming miniatures, including parts to build different ships from the original film's Death Star battle, including standing & seated pilot figures & different droid types.

 It's a bit more expensive than this kit, but you get what you pay for.

We had it for two weeks then it  broke.  The screen flashes on and off for no reason.  Nothing happened to it--it just started doing that.  Very weird.  No online support available from fisher price for this system either.  I bought several games that cannot be played now.  The kids liked it while it lasted though. We also have a Leapster which has lasted us eight months so far.  My boys like it much better too!!  So if you're going to buy a learning system I would recommend the leapster.

I bought this for our 3yo son who loves heavy equipment and digging in the dirt. This is a cool toy as far as being a pretty good replica of a real one but it does not work well in dirt or sand. Fine sediment gets caught in tracks and after a short amount of time, the tracks quit turning. Then the handles on the arm do not move the bucket well. My son has since ripped off the tracks and does not do any digging with it but still enjoys pushing it around. Don't buy this if you want your kid to actually dig dirt, it would be good inside toy or outside but away from dirt or sand. But, I think it was intended for playing in these areas, so the rig is not that well designed.

I had two problems with this item.  First, the planter is very small (only about 6 inches in length).  Secondly, it never grew!  I bought it for a first grade science experiment, but the class was very disappointed because nothing happened.  This item was not worth the money spent

I picked this item up for my 6 year old nephew who loves science. 
We put it together one night and I was surprised to find that the base and volcano are incredibly thin plastic that crack under any pressure at all. The plaster/sand mixture was impossible to work with, it just balled up into clumps and there was no real way of spreading it around smoothly. We both ended up with plaster all over us. Once it had dried, he was excited to get to paint it. As soon as he began to paint, parts of the plaster started breaking off in chunks. 
Hooking the plastic tubing up was not a major problem but I had issues keeping it hooked together. The "pump" system was supposed to send vinegar into a baking soda chamber to push up into the volcano. Instead the "pump" (which was a squeeze bottle) pushed the vinegar weakly upwards and then once it hit the baking soda chamber it clogged up. When it finally made its way out through the volcano after me squeezing the bottle as hard as possible, it barely trickled out. Once it had trickled enough, the rest of the plaster fell off as it got wet. He and his sisters just looked at me and asked "Is that it?" After three tries we trashed the whole thing.
Also, the "rock samples" that they give you in the kit are the size of the tip of your fingernail. I'm a geologist and these are not rare, expensive rocks. There was no reason to not include larger samples. 
He was very disappointed in the whole thing and so was I. I can't believe that the Smithsonian put their name on this product. We'll go back to our plaster volcano with vinegar and baking soda

These trains are very neat and my sons loved them when we first got them.  They each have been through two sets with the same result...the water leaks out after you've had them awhile.  They are not worth the money.  I highly recommend investing in another train instead of the aquarium cars.  This was the first time my guys have been disappointed with a Thomas product.

As others have stated the DVD mini-games are nearly impossible to play due to wonky controls. I also have no idea what the cards or pieces are for, other then they may come into play if you "win" the main game.

They should have just done a choose your own adventure type game.  It would have been less high-tech, but you could at least have a laugh when you choose "set up a perimeter" and the terrorists once again escape.

DO NOT BUY

This game was put together with a nice concept, be a CTU agent and help Jack Bauer stop the terrorist attack.  Also, I liked the fact that there is a mole and that someone right next to you could destroy the whole game.  However, the interactive games and such used to get more clues are not made well.  Though you try to do what it tells you to do, it doesn't seem to work.  Since these interactive parts are so simple, yet not made in a way that one can control what is going on, you waste your time trying to do them and you never get to the end.  I had three college students and two adults try it adn no one could seem to get it to work correctly.  So, if some bugs were worked out, this game could be a much bigger success

Sure wish my mother-in-law had read these reviews before giving this to me for Christmas.  Tried to play it once with my parents, who are also big 24 fans, a few nights later and were sorely disappointed. This game was obviously just shoved out the door to feed off the popularity of 24 the show and not to garner any popularity in its own right. 

The mini-games were an exercise in extreme frustration.  The problem is that the DVD is not ideal for those mini-games.  Whenever you try to move there are only two subsequent animations: the successful one and the unsuccessful one, which made it seem like it was just moving at random. Other than that it seemed like the game was going to be pretty linear, the clue cards contained no useful information, and the board completely superfluous, unless apparently you are masochistic enough to get to the bonus level

This was a waste of money!!  I bought these for my daughter Sophie, who is 23 months old, as a Valentines Day gift.  The crayons are very small and the holder makes them appear to be bigger.  The crayons all kept falling out of their holders and my daughter didn't enjoy playing with them.  I WAS NOT IMPRESSED and DO NOT RECOMMEND these to anyone.

I'm not going to go into my childhood, or how I love the Transformers or any of that stuff, I just wanted to give a quick review.  As always, you get what you pay for.  I bought this today and within five minutes of transforming it one of the joints popped out and I can't for the life of me get it to sit correctly back in the socket.  

Bottom line is that it is very cool that ten dollars will get you a G1 inspired Astrorain or Starscream, but be aware these feel very flimsy and are definately better utilized sitting on your desk at work in robot mode than being transformed back and forth while you are bored watching TV.  

Very cool, very flimsy, very inexpensive

We purchased all of the figures for my daughter for Christmas.  Within 2 weeks of her receiving this one, the pin fell out of her leg and her leg fell off.  We replaced it with a new one and the pin on the leg of that one fell off within a month.  The head does not stay on invisible violet, Syndrome broke in half, Violet's pin fell out of her arm, and Mr. Incredible lost the pin in his leg.  My daughter does not play rough with her toys.  Just normal play and they fell apart.  Also, Helen is supposed to be Elasta girl.  Why didn't they make her stretch?  Didn't make sense to me

This toy was so frustrating, the pieces wouldn't snap together properly and it was messy and my son ended up walking away from it he was so fed up.   This was after a half an hour of me attempting to make the pieces fit together properly.  In the end, it looked like a pile of cloudy lime Jello with plastic bones sticking out of it.  I would not reccomend this toy

I don't usually write reviews but had to voice my opinion on this toy.  I agree with the other review that the dolphins do not stay attached to the chariot and this frustrates my 4-year-old daughter!  Also our dolphins fall off and the one that is supposed to flip around gets stuck and does not flip half the time.  All that being said, she loves it

OK as far as novelty goes these ducks are SOOOO funny and what a great take on the rubber ducky!!! I bought them for my 1 year old just because I am sooooo tired of the original version of the yellow ducky. 
Anyone who feels this lil duck TOY is devil worship to has some serious issues, and I would suggest they need to seek some professional help.
So for the faint of heart dont buy the duck because I think it has magical powers which will make you giggle in delight.

On the shelf or on line, this trucks shovel appears to lock into position above the rig but it doesnt. It took me nearly 10 minutes to remove strapping anchored to this truck within the packaging. My son spent a minute playing with this truck only to move on to his other toys. Yeah, the shovel portion drags on the floor and will NOT lock into position above the rig. This truck can hardly be moved through the carpet much less in sand. I grew up with Tonka trucks and this was obviously designed by some young suit that was babysat by the television and playstation. If your looking for a durable fun truck for your child, move on as this truck wont get the smile your looking for.

This item is REALLY small. I didn't read the other reviews and missed the info on the actual size of the item. In hindsight, I wouldn't have order it had I paid more attention. I think the other products from Haba (eggs and teabags) are worth the money for the size.

I received my order today, and discovered (as with all of the Hasa products in my order) that although more than one item is pictured--  only one comes with the order.  The item itself is very small, 2 1/2" X 1".  That, fine, I can accept since the cost was under two dollars and since the item is made of wood, lifesize would make play a work-out for most children. However, shipping only one without a clear statement that each order is for ONE item and does not include all the items in the photograph is false advertising

This game is NOT for die hard fans of FRIENDS. The game bored me in 5 minutes. You need to watch like three episodes to get most of the questions correct and a lot of it are common sense. I was not at all challenged and did not enjoy playing this game and want to sell it back after playing it for 30 minutes. Don't buy it

The main issue is the controls. We are having a hard time getting this thing to fly well and the idea of pulling down to go down is weird to us pilot types. It tends to just nose dive regardless. We will give it another go at the park tomorrow but so far all it does is crash. That it's still in one piece is amazing

They show a pony in the picture. But You won't get it, just be careful when you think you will get the dining set and the pony. If you mistakly bought it . Just keep it. You will only get partial refund which is half the buying price.

Cheaply put together and does not include the things listed on the editorial review.  I am extremely disappointed.  The sides fall out when you close it making the crayons dislodge and roll around.  It is obvious that hinges on the box will wear out quickly.  I just cant believe it is such poor quality coming from Crayola

Back in the day (1970's) these were made with a stiff, strong PLASTIC, rigid "insert" w/ the poly-rope outside. This gave the "leash" a realistic, "tight but curved under own weight" appearance, & a believable / realistic "bounce" to the "dog" with the most imperceptible wrist action on the part of the "dog walker". HOWEVER, THIS PIECE OF CRAP has a thick soft wire inside the leash, and this gives the leash a very phony, fake-looking, too-heavy, all bent-up look. PIECE OF JUNK PIECE OF JUNK PIECE OF JUNK !

The idea behind this toy was a cute one, but it stops there.  Within five minutes of playing with this toy, it broke.  The dog halter broke off the wire leash and could not be repaired.  The whole thing ended up in the trash on Christmas Day!

I love legos, however I too was not real impressed with the 50th Anniversary tub. The Lego.com websites description of the contents: Each bucket includes LEGO System bricks in your favorite LEGO colors, plus a handful of gold-colored bricks! Let's be real, we're talking a child's handful, not adult. My daughter was lucky enough to get 8 gold bricks in her bucket. Another child I know got 4, his brother 5. The duplo set I bought had 6. If you're buying for the gold bricks, it's not worth the money

There are many significant shortcomings in this interactive DVD game.  I do not recommend it at all. It is not at all like the real Feud. The most frustrating shortcoming is that you must get the answers in the right order, since it reveals them in order, or you lose.  No steals, no strikes.  Sadly, I can't return it since its a DVD game

This is one of the most beautiful looking barbies we have ever bought. It is also the worst doll to date!

The doll NEVER worked from day one. It's tail bent up and it made grinding noises and didn't move or swim - just laid there. All the reviews on this site (which seemed to have disappeared since I notified MGA - the toy maker) were correct - NOT ONE BUYER had a working doll!!! We bought this for my daughter, niece and friend - and NONE of the 3 worked. It's not hard to follow the directions - they are pretty simple - so that is not the problem.

Also, the hair falls out and is EVERYWHERE in the bath water (pretty gross), and the bikini top is near impossible to get back on correctly!

Overall, the biggest disappointment in a toy so far

I bought this game hoping to have another great game for my girlfriend and I (we became bored playing backgammon all the time) and we are disappointed.  This game has nothing to do with any lost cities.... it's just a card game that requires you to stack cards in numeric order to get points...  you group the cards by color (which are supposed to represent cities????) and eventually the game ends after a certain number of cards are played and you tally up a bunch of numbers, divide that by pi, and then take the square root of you birth year and multiply that by five to see if you have either earned points or need to subtract them.  Then you do the math for your partner.  

We tried to play it a few times and it was just kinda dumb.... (The points arn't that difficult really!), but this game was a waste of time and twenty some odd dollars.   I suggest you take the $20 and buy a bottle of hooch, and have some real fun with your partner... unless you are 8 years old... in which case this game might be fun.

Just Terrible

This toy seemed like a fun idea, however it is utter chaos.  The toy moves randomly over the page and does not make any sort of comprehensive design.  Actually our table received more ink than the paper and then the kids could not get it to turn off.  I think it may be slightly posessed!

I bought this Barbie after seeing two pictures of angel Barbies on the website and reading the Manufacturer's Description. One picture seems to have been deleted now. The Manufacturer's description is of an angel with a dark blue dress and a long gold sash. I trusted that the Manufacturer's description, which matched one of the pictures, was the correct angel. The doll with the light blue dress is not impressive at all. It is very simple with vinyl wings. Be aware of which you are purchasing, the description is deceptive and incorrect

My wife and I purchased the VIDEONOW XP Interactive Video System for my son this Christmas however when we did Walmart was out of the headphones.  Well I was on Amazon one day and decided to look here.  I ordered them and was seriously disappointed when they arrived.  My 5 year old son attempted to put them on and all they did was fall to his shoulders.  No matter how we tried that is all they would do.  My 12 year old daughter decided to try them with her mp3 player with the same result!  I am able to wear them however even with my 30 year old head (size 8 1/4) it is still loose.  These are not adjustable which of course makes things all the worse.  I would just go ahead and pick up some other company's aftermarket headphones for your child.  If Tiger reads the reviews of their products at all then they need to ensure that they rethink the engineering of this device

I have bought two of these toys for my son, an only child and pretty gentle on toys.  It has been kept in his bedroom away from his playgroup.  He has not even played with it regularly.  Yet BOTH times these toys BROKE WITHIN MONTHS OF PURCHASE!!!

Yes, it is fascinating.  And like other reviewers, I've also had some fun with it myself. But I am disgusted that it broke down so easily--twice.  There must be a reason that Amazon doesn't offer new ones for sale; please think hard about buying a new one elsewhere.  Unless you don't mind looking at the $30 you'll pay as a month or two of entertainment, look to other gear toys that don't depend upon this lousy motor.

Ummm...I am a HUGE fan of Bratz, but this piece of junk is absolutely terrible. First of all, the eyes are super ugly. I can't believe they would make such an ugly product! The lips are fine. But I could reconsider by making better, cuter eyes! They broke when I had it after five minutes. THEY DO NOT BLINK. THEY TRY TO, BUT DON'T SUCCEED. DO NOT BUY!!

Second, the features are horrible. They are made so bad, I tried to make it walk since it couldn't on it's won! It does NOT walk. Note that. Also, it's head does not move. It was broken on mine and it made it fall down and the neck, while trying to move, muffled the song. Also, unless you wanna hear the same 20 second "Bratz Catz" song over and over again, do not buy this product. It will dissapoint your daughter like it did to me. I am the daughter, but am very dissapointed. I have returned mine and did not get a new one, either. I got some Bratz Babyz which were cuter than this junk!

I am warning you, this cat is brainwashed and should not be continued. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU WANT A CRYING DAUGHTER FOR IT!!!

Thank you for your patience and gratuity in reading this grievance.

Love,
Brownie, baby doll lover. Get babies instead, they're cute!

We looked for a trash truck that our 4 year old boy could play with. On the surface, the Bruder looked the part. Not as cartoon-looking as some, the fact that it looked like a real trash truck but had few obvious breakable parts made it seem like an ideal choice. 

Actual play testing though shows this product isn't very well-built, at least not enough to withstand normal wear and tear. This truck wasn't subjected to being thrown down the stairs, jumped on, etc. It's been just played with, but it started coming apart quickly. 

The hinged door in the back of the truck is a poor design. The plastic hinges on the truck are too thin, and break easily. The plastic hinges on the door start to bend after multiple open/closes, and the plastic weakens and breaks off. 

The hinged front compartment and rear sections are difficult to operate, and stick easily. Items put into the cab (like the essential green army man who drives the truck) easily get caught in here and are very difficult to remove. 

Worse though is the key point of this toy, the ability to latch the trash can to the lifting/dumping mechanism. This is way to complex for a child, and the intricacy in getting a solid connect is difficult even for an adult.  If it's not hooked up right, the can falls off when you try to lift it; very frustrating. 

Some little pieces (rear view mirror, etc) broke off easily and early on, but we kind of expected this. The parts were simply too small and fragile to last long. I don't hold this part against the design; part of the attraction was that it looked like a real truck, and I don't think there's an easy way to add small details without some fragility.

While this is orignally was one of my sons favorite toys, he can't really play with it the way he'd like to. While he still enjoys driving it around the house, he can't pick up the trash and dump it without an adults help, and that's a shame. 

For the price, I expected so much more.

I bought this as a gift for my 81 year old mother, who is impossible to please.  She needed a new card shuffler, as she wasn't pleased with her plastic, battery operated one.  I must admit, I thoroughly expected to have to return it, since I knew she wouldn't be pleased with it.  As it turns out, I did have to return it, but here's the surprise.  I was very disappointed in its performance too!  We could not get it to shuffle cards, whether they be from a new deck, or an old, worn out, dog eared deck.  Moral of this story -- please don't buy this item, whether you're difficult to please or not

My daughter, 6, received this for Christmas. Her 4-year-old brother also  wanted to play with it.

The first problem is that there are NO INSTRUCTIONS included for how to put it together. This is a problem when you have two antsy kids eager to play with it. I was struggling with getting the various panels to snap together solidly when, after repeated attempts, I happened to look in the drawer underneath the colored bulbs and crayons, and found -- what do you know! -- screws. Then, after I put on the top, I realized I should have installed the light bulb first (you need a light bulb of 25 watts or less, not included). Then, when I thought I was done, I found I had a piece left over. Arrgh!

That extra piece was a clip that is supposed to hold a picture for tracing. Ha! Even after I installed it, there's no tension on the clip and very little chance that it will hold anything.

There are two drawers to hold the bulbs and crayons. Good idea. But for some reason the drawers catch and stick. How hard can it be to make drawers that slide easily in and out?

This item looks great in theory, but it just isn't worth it. The pegs are made in all different sizes - some fall out, some don't fit in, and some stick out too far, leaving you with a messy look to your lite art. One of the crayons for the neon was broken when received, but it didn't matter, since it just looked like a regular crayon drawing on black paper anyway. If you do buy this item, be sure to purchase that 25w light bulb that isn't even included

I am a breast cancer survivor and I find this pink dressed, blond "doll" of  perfection rather insulting to my female self, the perfect perky boobs, the long blond hair, the body that does not exist on a woman after the ravages of chemotheraphy.  I can perfectly understand Mattel wanting to support breast cancer research and donate a portion of proceedes towards funding (and thank you for your generosity), but to do it under the guise of selling a "doll" which does not reflect the community of women who have experienced the challenges of recovery and survivorship...a doll which does not look like a survivor is literally painful and insulting!  Why doesn't this doll have a wig?  Why doesn't she have a breast removed?  Why doesn't she have a bra fitted with a form to mimic the shape of a breast?  What is wrong with reality?  Why can't Mattel acknowledge the true nature of this disease and make a doll which comforts, not insults the sensibility of women who have suffered from this disease.  I will purchase this doll, just because I am horrified by the product itself.  I will disrobe her, and with a saw, cut off her breast so that she will look more like me, a survivor, a woman of pride.  I will dismantle the construct of supposed beauty and make this image more like my own - because I am what is woman, not the facade of a false construction.

I purchased this toy based on the excellent reviews it had here at Amazon, it looked also like a fun toy with educational value.  I am very disappointed.  For starters, my son finds it very frustrating that the front pieces for eyes, face & hat can only go on in one order.  He also has trouble pulling the pieces apart once they are together, and he is very dextrous for his age.  Also disappointing is the lack of container to store all the pieces in.  Without this, the blocks are loose in my son's toybox and we can never find all the pieces.  The packaging could easily be redesigned to hold the pieces. All in all, it is not a toy he can sit and play with without assistance, as I had thought it might be.  When he does play with it he enjoys it for about 15 minutes and moves on to something else.  We could have done without this toy under our Christmas tree

The kids got it for Christmas, and it looked like fun.  However, the one we got doesn't work at all.  I'm not sure if we just got a bad one or if this problem is common, but I can't even get it to turn on without changing the batteries, and then I can't get it to go into the game mode.  Plus, the rules of the electronic version are different, in that you lose all your points if you keep acting out words.  I prefer the rules of the old version better.  I'm planning to return this and get the old version

This is not the usual quality that Playhut stands for.  The tent is held up by one plastic-corded pole that won't keep the tent upright.  My daughter gets trapped in it as it collapses.  The slumber bag is pretty, but the tent/tunnel is useless

My son and I have had the same experience with this sticker maker.  Great fun for the first 5-10 stickers but then the sticker role jammed and I did not have the opportunity to give the insides a good look before I was desparately trying to remember how it all went back together.  Too bad...he loved it while it lasted

This is not a very fun toy.  My [...] got tired of filling the paint chamber because it would empty so quickly.  He also ended up dipping the brush into the paint jars.  He went through both jars of paint in under 10 minutes and was finished with the toy.  There wasn't enough paint to even create a picture.  The Happy Birthday pic on the back of the package must've taken over 20 bottles and a very skilled artist.  I think Crayola should stick to making crayons

This paint brush globs out the paint, doesn't spread to make any kind of picture and the brush barely holds any paint. We went through both of the provided things of paint in about five minutes and had no picture to show for it. Not to mention that the bottle is to small for the brush to fit in so when the paint is about half way down you can't get the brush in it to suck the paint up.  I am so disappointed

I was very excited about this game until it came out of the box.  It looks great for my 3 year-old but as in other reviews the spinner ruins the entire game.  This should have been obvious at design and this game should never have made it to stores with this defect.  It is particularly frustrating because the concept seems so good with a lot of thought put into the educational value.  I think ill will is going to be the result of this penny minding in construction.  Leapfrog could have further enhanced the brand with this product but fumbled

To anyone who buys this toy, keep the box and receipt handy.  We may be the odd one out, but we purchased this toy and it didn't work. The legs on Manny are to be pulled back to fire a rubber ball.  This didn't happen.  Rapid pushing and pulling of his legs produces 'rapid fire', and if we were lucky one would shoot out - after great effort. It comes with three foam balls, two of which fit, the third was slightly too big and would jam.  Ours is going back to the store today.

This toy, like several other Mattel toys I've purchased in the past 5 years are difficult to put together, troublesome to play with, and not durable. I wish Mattel would think more about the kids playing with their toys and less about the stockbrokers. Toys can be easy to assemble. Intuitive to play with and rugged as a tank. It just depends on priorities of the toy design/builder

My son received this for Christmas 2005 and played with it every day. The conveyor belt is noisy when running and the sponges that whirl around at the end of the car wash were constantly falling off and getting lost. After a month of being played with on a daily basis the conveyor belt stopped working - it still made plenty of noise but didn't move anymore! When I called Mattel they couldn't offer me replacement parts as the toy was discontinued in 2001! Although they gave me a voucher to buy a replacement toy, it wasn't for as much as I paid for the toy.

These figures look pretty decent at first glance but when you take them out of the box you see how bad they really are. My superman broke in half (at the waist) when I took him out of the box! Add that to the fact that there are only an average of six points of articulation on each (only three on Wonder Woman!) and you see that these aren't very high quality figures. Amazo is transparent, which makes no sense whatsoever. He isn't an invisible character. I also don't like that, while superman's S and belt stick out from his uniform, Bizarro's are merely painted on. Only buy this item if you love doomsday and its on sale. It's not worth its list price by a long shot

My daughter who is about to turn 4 loves this game.  She wants to play it constantly.  So it's good for their entertainment value but bad for yours. The dresses are hard to get on the dolls and they rip and tear very easily.  It takes as long to set the game up as it does to take it.  There are also some sketchy directions such as rolling the dice but not having to go as far as the die say but you can't go over that numbers i.e. you roll a 4 but you only want to go 3 spaces then that's allowed.  That's confusing when you're trying to teach your kids their numbers and how many spaces to go but otherwise you'd be rolling the dice forever trying to get to the one spot you're trying to reach

We bought this game yesterday for our daughter.  The dolls are very difficult for her to dress.  We have to do it for her.  Also, two of the dresses have torn already after playing the game only about 4 times.  She loves the game and the princesses, and it does teach memory, but it could be made much better.

Twice I gave this board game as a gift this holiday season, and my own 5-year-old daughter received it as a gift. While the idea of the game seems good, there seems to be some misleading print on the box. It indicates that the prinesses will be getting ready to meet Prince Charming at the ball, but there is no Prince Charming included in the game pieces--much to the dismay of my daughter! My biggest complaint about this game, however, is with the gowns and accessories the princesses wear as they move about the board. The straps of the dresses are very thin, and my daughter has broken three of the four gowns. She has also broken two crowns and the strap on one purse. My daughter plays with the rubber Polly Pocket things as well, and she has not torn/ripped any of those items, which makes me think the Crowns and Gowns items aren't made as strongly

What a co-incidence, my first 3D puzzle too.

Average difficulty for the average user. Would not recommend it for the beginner.

The panels are not hard to put together, but it is fiddly putting all the panels together. Once done, the model is quite magnifique. And got me started on 3D puzzles. Hasbro/Wrebbit should give everyone 1 free 3D puzzle, then everyone would get hooked on it. 

None of the 3D puzzles can stand a lot of handling, however this Eiffel Tower actually survived a show and tell. Sadly it now rests in 3 pieces and I'm too lazy to put it back together again. Highly recommended

I popped in the batteries and was unable to get any sound whatsoever.  I even put in a different set up batteries; still, no dice.  This is the worst excuse for a keyboard ever.  I am sorry that I will be pitching this in the trash and it will take up space in a landfill.  After the reading the other reviews, perhaps I am fortunate that this clunker never even made a sound.  I gather that I'm not missing much.

I bought this for my son's birthday last night since he is interested in music.  As I was wrapping it, I noticed half of the keys were stuck in the up position.  I took it out and managed to bang the keys back into place, wondering how many times I was going to have to do this.  I decided to test it once I fixed it because the toy just looked horribly cheap with very thin plastic keys (you can even see through them).  The dollar store has better toys than this.  The sound is horrible and uncontrollable.  The controls are worthless.  I'm returning it today, and good riddance

Purchased this for a 3 1/2 year old boy.  Was hesitant about buying any large, plastic truck, but we did not see any alternatives at the time we purchased this.  We should have stuck with our instinct.  When it arrived, we were immediately struck by the fact that the plastic seemed flimsy, and that many small plastic pieces that are attached to the grader appeared and felt so cheap and flimsy that we doubted they would survive 5 minutes of play, in our humble opinion.  We were not going to wait to find out, and we decided to send this back.  You can get a STEEL Tonka 18" grader off of ebay for less than what Amazon is asking for this plastic thing.  That's exactly what we did.  Good luck

This playhut was very frustrating for our children. My children enjoyed it when it was left in the slumber position. Our trouble began when we turned it into a tent. The sleeping bag is one side of the tent. It's heavy so it sags leaving little room for children to play. After about ten minutes, the playhut was turned over and on the ground. We returned it..

I bought this toy for my three-yr-old. She was excited, but then one of the dolls fell apart, its pelvis broke and the legs fell out. Super glue might fix it, but I'm not sure. 

I'd recommend it for an older child who wouldn't play with it so roughly. But for the price, I wanted it to last more than three days

My daughter is almost 6 and we got her this for Christmas.  The commercials made it look really cool and easy for kids, no more scissors!  Well we opened it today and it's too hard for her to hold the button down for any amount of time and to move it around slowly enough to actually cut anything.  I'm having to do it all for her and my hand gets tired too!  They should have made it that the "pen" cuts when just being pushed on the paper or something.  I have a 9 year old also that was trying to use it and it wasn't all that easy for him either.  Seems more like something teens or adults that scrapbook would use

I've owned this toy for a few weeks and have given up on it.  At first this toy was a little fun and I was optimistic about getting it to handle correctly.  I'd adjust the top screw to trim it from spinning clockwise or counter clockwise and everything.  This gets old after doing it every time after a charge. Next, using the forward and backward control doesn't work that well. Also, it will drop out of the sky or do something weird every now and then.  All in all I wouldn't buy it again, especially at the higher price it is currently going for.  Try the smaller havoc, it seems to handle a little better (Youtube has a few movies of it flying).

I got this toy for my one of my triplet sons for his 5th birthday, and I am appalled that I paid $50 for such a poorly made product.  They say it "transforms" into the batmobile - that is a joke!  You have to take most of it apart to get it to fold back up, so why bother with that "feature" in the first place?  The whole thing is made terribly.  It barely stands upright, and the little plastic chains that suspend the one set of platforms keep coming off the little plastic hooks.  None of my boys play with it, and now I am stuck with it because I don't have the box anymore to return it.  Bottom line:  this was a complete waste of money

I have to agree with everyone before me.  Flimsy, hard to put together, doesn't stay together, impossible to close.  My four old, who is obsessed with batman, lost interest after 5 minutes and I really can't blame him.  Spend your $50 on something else!!! Not a good purchase!!!!!

     This pack is really Bad! I LOVE attacktix, but this pack is terible! The only good figues are Luke Skywalker, and Megatron. Darth Vader's arm broke, Super Optimus Prime's blast shoots before you press the button, and the battle masters are Pathetic. The Battle Master's point value is 70 each, but they are very easy to kill, and their blasts are very bad.
    Do yourself a faver, skip this and buy the Star Wars attacktix series 4 starter set

What a disappointment! The music quality is very poor--most of the "intruments" sound just like every other cheap kids electronic toy.  The piano is probably the worst; the animal voices all sound the same. I thought I'd get better quality at the price, plus, the left speaker doesn't work.  My kids had a toy casio keyboard that cost $12.00 and was the size of an egg-carton, and its sound was vastly superior. I will likely have to go through the hassle of returning this.

I got this to for my daughter for her birthday. I opened it and put the bubble solution and batteries into it and it worked fine. Later that night the bubble blower wasn't blowing anymore. So the next morning I changed out the batteries and still it wasn't working. I returned it the next day. It was really cute and I wanted it to work but it just wouldn't start and it also kept leaking. Every where I put it the sticky soap mess was there after I picked it up. THIS WAS NOT A GOOD TOY

Put simply, this toy doesn't work. Or I should say perhaps it would work with really good bubble solution but it does not work with the bubble solution that comes with it. It sort of sputtered some bubble solution out the top but we never got even one full bubble much less the stream of bubbles we were hoping for. Luckily my little son never saw the toy and therefore didn't mind when we took it back

I got this as a gift for my 18 month old son. It only produces one lousy bubble with each pull of the handle, very sad. My son got very frustrated and so did I. I would not recommend this product.

I just bought this game and tried for 3 hours to make it work on 3 different t.v. sets - NO LUCK.  I can't even give it 1 star because I don't know how fun it is (or might be).  I tried every "input" available on every t.v., I tried changing the batteries, I tried hooking it directly to the t.v. as well as thru the VCR and DVD player - nothing worked.  I guess I know why it only cost $5.99.

I purchased this car for my 2 year old son for Christmas.  Shame on me for not taking it out of the box and testing it out prior to Christmas morning.  The car lights up and makes sounds (very annoying) but didn't move an inch.  I replaced all batteries - still no movement.  The manufacturer was of no help.  Thank god someone else also got him the Chicco remote control car - because it works!

Steer clear of this stinker

We received this as a gift and didn't like it at all.  My two year old used it for about a day. But it doesn't go very far with the remote (you can't just have it move across the floor) and it's VERY noisy! If it is walked away from you can hear it in the other room still making an annoying noise. I'd go with something else if you're looking for a first remote control ca

I consider myself to be a fairly intelligent individual, and growing up in a family where a Saturday was spent working on the classic car in the garage, or watching football on Sunday, as a female, I know a lot of male stuff.  Even I couldn't answer hardly ANY of the "male" questions, since in this game, men answer questions about womanly stuff, and women answer questions about manly stuff.  We have played it twice now, and even though the men's team has always had 1 male more in touch with his female side than most, the women have always gotten our butts kicked.  It is so one sided it's not even funny.  Even the men were saying, it's not even fun since the game lasts basically 10 minutes.  One of the men said he even had to think twice about some of the "male" questions.  If I were anyone looking to get a good party game, I certainly wouldn't put my money out to get this again.

Don't buy this unless you plan on attaching the remote to your forehead with duct-tape; if you lose the remote you cannot operate the moon. The moon also has an automatic time that it comes on; it's supposed to be when it gets dark, but it comes on way too early to be any good, because nobody is in their room that early, and it only stays on for 30 minutes. When it comes on by itself, (because its too early) you can barely notice it is on.

My brother, the uncle of my two sons, purchased this item for Christams.  In the excitement of testing this item out they realized the battery backing was not able to be opened.  The screw casing was stripped!  No big deal, I thought, I would just call the company.  They are not willing to replace the prodect unless I pay for shipping.  They recomeded that I take it to a local store to replace knowing that it was purchased over 1000 miles away and not at a chain store!  Passing the buck.  I then asked to speak to a super visor and she repeated the same mantra, "sorry company policey."  I never go to the lengths that I am now, but I am tired of companies not performing the basic duties of customer satisfaction.  They want me to go to the post office and mail it to them at which time they will determine whose fault it is and then mail me a new one.  When I asked if there was any way around said policy the manager told me I could write a letter.  So here it is

Gave this heli to my 30 year old son on his birthday. It was supposed to be easy to fly. It rolled over and crashed inches off the ground on its maiden flight, spewing propeller parts everywhere. With all retailers out of replacement parts it may never fly. If you buy this heli, don't buy it through the mail or online but from a local dealer with parts and expertise to help you get it back together

The tail rotor fell off right out of the box on the first throttle up. The landing gear fall off if you do not glue them yourself. Not only is it poorly made for the money but it is an extreemly touchy machine. Main rotor to tail mixing have to be perfect. Final thought.... After several hours of hard work adjusting the tail to main rotor mix I managed to get it to stay in the air for a few seconds.   If you want an R/C helicopter try the Japanese made Hirobo XRB SR.

Even though I purchased this watch for my grandson for Christmas from another store, it was not worth the money. It does nothing and my grandson abandoned it soon after opening it.  I picked up few pieces from under the sofa last night.   I did see on one toy store's website that there is a deluxe model that is probably better. I wish I had known that before I spend $10 on this piece of junk.

Actually, we love the game very much but are very disappointed with Pressman Toys.  Here's the scoop:  our game came with only 20 pegs of each color -- the box clearly shows at least 40 of each color.  We've called the company 1800 800-0298 x 186 several times but they refuse to send us additional pegs.  Just bad business practice in my opinion.  As the saying goes, when you love something you tell a few people, when you're not happy you tell everyone.  I'll be sure to check that I'm not buying items from Pressman Toys next time.  So instead of returning the game and paying for shipping we'll just have to win in fewer steps.  SIGH!

This was a gift for my 2 year old last christmas.  The screws they provide to put the wheels on are no good. As soon as your child starts "walk" his new dog, the wheels completely unscrew, which can be a terrible choking hazzard.  We have tried everything to keep them on.  Plus the leash tore off from around poor spot's neck, and no type of glue seems to keep it on. I'm afraid this cute little toy is going into the trash. It was good idea and a cute toy, but not worth the money. You're better off buying a plastic, already put together one.

After returning three defective Tonka Hands On Power Shovels, (aka crane,) we decided to try a different piece of machinery and brought home the dump truck.  So far the dump truck is doing fine.  It is not as exciting as the crane or digger, but it does work and seems to be holding up.  My son loves to turn it on &amp; have it &quot;follow&quot; him around the room.  However the motor strains, and the truck moves very slowly, so I'm concerned that the load is too much for the motor.  He likes the loading action of the front end shovel into the dump bed, and the dumping bed.  He was disappointed that it doesn't steer like the crane did, but only goes either forward or reverse.  But a working toy is better than an non-working toy, and I'm hopeful this one will be a keeper

For the most part this is a good toy.  It was actually one of the easier items I took out of a box this week :)

My daughter (4) loves it and as long as you can tolerate the "Mommy/Daddy the wing fell off can you put it back on?" every 5-10 minutes then it really is good.  I guess if your child is old enough and has the dexterity to put the wings back on by herself this toy would be GREAT

I purchased this item for my son's birthday.  Not well built as it needed lots of tape to keep it together and readjustments after each attempt to fly it.  Also appears to need the wind just right and thrown a certain way in order for it to fly.  After a couple of  days we were able to accomplish only one 2 min. successful flight.    On the second day, after 15 mins of recharging the battery, the battery case and wires melted.  Have contacted company for a refund.

I think this doll is incredibly fun and beautiful, but somehow the tail broke off the very first day my 4 year old daughter played with it.  She loves it anyway, she insists.  She just screamed with pleasure after seeing the hair turn purple and the tattoos appear after about 3 minutes in the freezer.

I don't know how it got broken, or how rough my daughter might have been, but it seems strange that it would break so quickly.  Disappointing

Besides being unstable, this truck is extremely frustrating!  My son is constantly trying to put items in the truck that are too big, and then if he does manage to get a "load" in, he can't get it back out again!!

My son LOVES cars and trucks so this looked like it would be a big hit, but like the other reviewers, we have had to put this toy away because of all the injuries.  He used the handle to push it, but the toy is unbalanced, so any pressure on the back causes it to flip up and hit him in the face.  He's had several big bruises and one cut lip.  

Since posting this, I've spoken to a rep for Little Tykes. She said they would look into this toy a bit more and sent a replacement toy for my son to play with until he is able (if ever) to use the dump truck again. If you've had a problem with this truck, please call them so that they can get it on record

we got this for our son for Easter, and he was playing with donnie the dumptruck, and the handle part was opened, so it was the flat blue portion of the truck, well he some how slipped, and ended up cutting his forehead b/c the blue portion does have somewhat of a sharp part. Luckily enough it wasn't where he needed stitches, but still...so I called Little Tikes, and they said they wanted me to mail it back and they let me choose another toy-so there Customer Service at Little Tikes is Definitly a +! Just watch out because I think the ages on this toy should be a little older. Semper F

I think this product needs a LOT of hands-on supervision.  My son slipped off and knocked the wind out himself TWICE on the 2nd day of trying this.  After a couple of weeks, he finally regained his confidence to try it when a friend was over -- and his 6 y.o. friend slipped and knocked the wind out of herself (almost had to call the paramedics).  Knowing what I know now... I would NOT buy this product for kids under 8 (follow the age recommendations!!!!!).  I would like to take a pair of wire cutters and cut it down....

I was excited about this pool because it seemed really easy to store when not in use. However, the new type of valve does not hold in the air. It says to push it all the way in but the valve on the one I bought would not stay in and when I tried to close the valve the presure from the air inside pushed open the valve and it deflated. It would have been perfect had the valve worked properly.

We loved this pool for three weeks, which is as long as we had it.  This morning, I went out to remove a small amount of rain water from the cover to find that the cover with roughly 1/4" of rain had collapsed the top tier and that we had grass growing up through the bottom of the pool, through plastic.  I could see both happening had the pool sat in one place for a long period of time but this was after less than 24 hours.  A total waste of money

This is a great idea for a great marketing group . . . little kids who want to listen to music "just like the big kids." The FP3 has a few issues of it own, but the speakers were disappointing. The sound quality is not good. Even with the volume turned up it is difficult to hear. Another huge down fall is that a power cord is not available . . . so you can end up going through batteries pretty fast. To top it all off, my son has difficulty getting the FP3 correctly mounted into the speaker unit on his own. Overall we were very disappointed with this accessory

It looks fun in the picture, but there is a major design flaw with this toy - the wheels stick out so far that when the rider tries to go they end up slamming their ankle into the tire.  Within 2 minutes of using this toy my son ripped open his ankle.  This toy should be recalled.  Do not buy it. I would send mine back, but we had already thrown out the packaging

The retro-slinky dog, however cute, just doesn't work.  We have tried it on the hardwood floor, the carpet, the title.  We have tried tying a string arounds it's neck, adding a string to it's short stubby string, using the short stubby string to pull it but nothing works.  Our kids 2 & 6 just drag it around laying on it's side--it's just not fun--the head is too heavy and it doesn't move well at all.  I would not buy it.  the Fisher Price doggy we got is very cute and it stays upright, it walks with you and the pull-string is a good length--plus it's cute too!!

This game is ok, entertains my children for a little while.  I thought everything was ok, but then, after only a couple of months, the cartridges started to malfunction!  We have two leap pads and some games work in one, but not the other (and visa versa!)  For the price, I don't want the toy to not work 1/2 the time after only a few uses.  The books seem to hold up pretty good, but the cartridges don't.  And, at a price of around $12 each, I was very dissapointed.  If the cartridges worked all the time, I would probably give this toy 4 stars, as it is fun (when it works) and portable.  One last comment for improvement, would be to have the volume be on the outside, not in the book, as the regular volume is a bit too loud and I have to ask my little one to turn it down each time she switches books/cartridges

If I would have been able to try this out before buying it I would have never bought it. The surface is way to hard for a baby to be laying on it. The it is not too sensitive to movement so when baby kicks or moves it doesnt always turn itself on. I would have much rather bought a playmat instead.

My daughter got this came for Christmas and it is still fun to play, but the new graphics are very confusing and hard to follow.  They want a little overboard in their updating of this one.  New colors would have been fine, but all the curves, zig-zags, etc, make this version a poor substitute for the older versions.  I'm going to ebay!

You can get the old vintage aggravation games on Ebay for 10 or less and theres also some hand-made wooden boards as well. These new versions dont hold a candle to the old ones, Just as old tvs seem better than some of the new ones

This school bus was smaller than I expected, about 4 inches long. I bought it for my 3 year old son who loves school buses. He broke it in the first 5 minutes of opening the package. It's a pull-back and go car. And he pulled it back too far on the first try and it snapped the wheels. They were wobbly from then on. This toy is not for kids and it's not really for playing with from what I can tell. Very dissappointed

Bought this and several other Minimates for by son's birthday.  As we are huge Lego fans, I thought this would be a great compliment.  The "lego-like" bricks are ill fitted, either constantly coming undone or never being able to fit together at all.  This caused great frustration and unhappiness.  We finally had to hide the entire lot from my son too keep him from breaking down everytime he or another family member tried to put the Batcave or any of the vehicles together.  Do not buy.  I would like a full refund and an apology from Amazon for carrying such an afwul quaility toy, and from the creator of the Minimates. Ugh

3 Stars overall ONLY b/c we LOVE c3! Read on...
The batcave C3 set has some rather intense structural integrity problems that cause it to be next to impossible to put together without a supplemental "fix-it" set that was distributed by the mfg. after many SEASONED ADULTS protested their frustrations with its construction. Since the company has now withdrawn all c3 items from its website, it is not known whether the "fix-it" package is still available (it included thicker, stronger support pieces for the first floor, and additional pieces for a stairway support column). Without these, the set tends to implode well before you ever get the 2nd level completed, let alone the 3rd!
After all the problems started surfacing, the company also increased the "recommended age range" to 7+ from the previous 4+. If you purchase a box that states 7+ as the age range, it SHOULD include the "fix" parts (no guarantee, we're only assuming), but even with the "fix" pieces, it is still a major headache to put together, and your true calling is an architect if you manage to get it safely together on the first try. It takes most adults several tries over several days (due to frustration stress level) to get this piece fully assembled.
There is a step-by-step construction guide showing the problems (with "crash" pictures) in set construction, Amazon rules say I can't post the link here, but it shouldn't be too hard to find if you enter c3 batcave in a search engine, the full write-up is in a c3 forum.
I know many people may still purchase--it is after all, Batman, but I would at least try to see if you can acquire the replacement parts before ordering, as you will have much greater chance for success. OR wait until you get the package, if it says 7+ on the box, you just may be in luck. In the alternative, maybe you could use super-glue to the existing inadequate structural supports?
OR, raid your kid's Lego stash and use thicker, more stable blocks than the ones supplied with this set

After waiting 3-4 weeks, it finally arrived! To my grandchildrens dismay. It did not perform as advertised.
There wasn't any volcano erupting, all it did was sprinkle a small amount from the side. Yes we did have good water pressure, and it was put together correctly!
I just want my money and shipping charges back!

Despite reading bad reviews, I took a chance and purchased this item.  I got the first one, hooked it up and it quit working within two hours.  Ordered a second, it quits working within the hour.  I should have known better as others have posted the same experience.  Great concept, maybe they will get the actual product correct in the next year.  Please don't waste your time on this one now....

I bought this doll for my daughter for christmas and she was so excited, however in the last three days I have found that this doll was not worth the price.  The paint on the lips has already worn off, the eye lashes are falling out and it is difficult to keep the face clean, no matter how many times a day we wash it.  It has also stopped drinking when the bottle is placed into it's mouth.  I know of several other girls that are friends of my daughter who are having the same diffculties as we are.  If my daughter didn't love this doll some much I would return it for something worth it.  I guess if you are just intrested in making your child happy this is a good product however for the money I would suggest something else.

If it were up to my children, they would rate this stuff 5+ stars.  They love it and they are totally entertained with it.  It is one of the only times they play quietly without fighting.  Mom, on the other hand, hates it and you know it is bad when a toy gives mom some free time of peace and quiet and she wants no part of it!!!

This stuff sticks to everything and anything-including your children.  You can't believe the mess it makes.  Imagine billions of tiny little balls stuck to everything in your house.  I confine it to their playroom, but it follows them everywhere they go.  You will find it all over your house and in everything-you can't escape it.  

As for the product itself, it definitely doesn't dry out, but it also doesn't hold together as well as described making it quite difficult to make the objects it claims you can make on the package.  Once you put colors together it is impossible to separate them out as they are tiny millimeter balls.  Playdooh may dry out if left out, but it doesn't make anywhere near the mess this stuff does and it also molds much better than playfoam!

My advice is to stick with your playdooh

My 21 month old toddler loved the star crayon, and so did I initially.  However, during its first use the red crayon fell out of the plastic holder.  The problem is the shape of the crayon is like a round piece of candy.  My son picked it up and was about to put it in his mouth when I saw what had happened.  Personally, I would not use the product given the choking hazard that it presented.  Otherwise, I would use it with care and watch your child carefully as they play with the product.

When this toy is turned on it seriously sounds like an air-raid siren is going off.  I can't use my usual trick of putting tape over the speaker because you need to be able to hear the instructions to play the games.

Also, the counting/shape game is confusing.  There is a row of shapes with numbers on them, and the game asks the child to, for example, find 3 rectangles.  It's trying to get the child to press the rectangle shape three times, but the rectangle shape is marked with the number 8.  There's a circle marked with the number 3.

The only reason I'm not giving this one star is because my son enjoys playing the "repeat the tone" and "count the villians" games.  I'm not sure how much longer the adults in the house can handle the siren noise, though, I may try to hide this and get him a leapfrog toy instead

Perhaps a age group should be posted as with most toy sellers.  I bought it for my 4 year old nephew and it's worthless to anyone other than I guess stores who like to stick star war stickers on the retail counters.  It is deceiving and the retailer is arrogant and would not even consider a return since it was opened to see what it was.  Avoid this retailer and it's products

Pro: easy to visualize the numbers on the screen.
Cons:The biggest negaTIVE draw back is that the keys are not very sensitive. You have to push very hard and often multiple times to get a response. This is very frustrating- the help keys does not help at all. Do not buy it ,IT IS A WASTING MONEY

My 3 year old daughter and I have no problem making good size bubbles with this wand.  The design is nice, it snap back easily for storage and the color is nice.  However, after using it twice, the plastic hoop at the snapping piece and the stick is twisted.  This makes the hoop to be wailing back and forth even though it was snap in place.  It makes the wand impossible to make bubble by waving.  My daughter was frustrated.  I eventually went with some cheap plactic wands that do not have the fancy mechanism and they are extremely durable with many abusive use from a little child.  I don't recommend this wand

The dress featured on this particular set shows a girl in a FLOWING blue and pink gown... you get the blue and pink gown, but it's not what's pictured on the box.  It sort of looks like it, but it is a flimsier, straight version of the one pictured.  Also, my daughter just turned 4.  She's on the petite side, and is around 32 lbs.  This dress JUST fits her.  Hope this info helps

Bought this product for my two sons ages 4 and 6.  Within the first week one of the sticks was broken.  Called the company and they sent out another one, but before it could arrive the other stick broke.  They aren't made strong enough to use.  They plastic simply cracks and totally falls apart.  We ended up throwing it out

This is a very cheaply made product that does not stand up to any child play.  My sons got this recently and within 24 hours one of the sticks had broken.  The company was nice enough to send a new one out but now (only a few weeks later) the plastic on the goal is shattered.  The goal also does not stay together very well and comes apart with each goal scored.  Overall, I would highly discourage you from wasting quite a bit of money for plastic that will not hold up to child play!!

I bought this carry case for my son's L-Max.  It works well for carrying the unit and all the games he has for it.  I wouldn't advise dropping it on a hard surface of any sort.  It is not nearly padded enough to be carrying a hand held gaming unit of any sort.  My son likes to take his L-Max to school with him for mornings before school begins.  I place it in the carrying case and then place the carrying case inside of his backpack to give it some extra cushioning.  

If I had known how little padding there was in this particular carrying case I probably wouldn't have bought it.  There is a carrying case out for the Nintendo Wii that is similar in style but much more padded.  I almost purchased it but then thought that I should get something designed for the Leapster L-Max.  If I had it to do over I would have purchased the case for the Wii.  It might have been a little big but the extra padding would have made up for it.

Overall, it is not a bad purchase but for the money you should get something a little more protective.  After all, the Leapster starts at $69.99 and the price goes up accordingly for the L-Max

I bought this table set for my son because it was inexpensive and I did not want to spend a lot of money for something that was sure to get paint and glue all over it.  From day one it was a big dissapointment. The chairs are very easily tipped over, he can not even sit on the chair if I am not holding it or the chair would fall over.  The tabe is not made well as it is easy for things to slide off the surface.  It seems to be slightly raised in the middle.  I am now online shopping for a new one.  So instead of paying 100 dollars the first time around, I am now spending the 30 dollars already spend and an additional 100 for the new tabl

It can be almost impossible to turn at times.  Instead of moving one to the right, you have to go three to the left, or fiddle with it so it lines up properly.  You can still solve the cube but it gets annoying when it doesn't move the way you want it to.

I was hoping it'd be better cause it's really cool that it fits in your pocket.  It's just too hard to turn.  I ended up breaking the thing trying to get it to turn one way.  And I cant put it back together cause one of the pieces is missing.  I really like this product (I'm buying another one), I just wish it wasn't so stiff.

Maybe they made it stiff so it wouldn't turn in your pocket but if you know how to do it, you can finish a rubik's cube in 5 minutes, max, so I don't see the need to prevent it from turning.  Apparently they thought people would solve like half of it and finish it latter

Ancient Sanctuary throws lots of unique cards at us.  First, Fairy decks start to rise from the junk pile in the corner of your room.  Zombies finally have an 1800 attacker.  Machines have a mean burn monster.  The rares are something else.  Soul Resurrection is a Call of the Haunted except the monster goes into defence mode.  And it's only a rare! There is also Blowback Dragon, who like his brother, Barrel Dragon, has the same effect.  Instead of destroying monsters only, Blowback destroys ANY card on the field.  Zaborg the Thunder Monarch is also a plus to this set, destroying any monster on the field when summoned.  I got this 5 set and got Gear Golem, the Moving Fortress, Enemy Controller, Draining Shield, Zaborg the Thunder Monarch and Avatar of the Pot.  In other words, buy it.  This is worth the money

I was disappointed with the quality of this item.  Little tike is a name I have learned to trust and this was a bummer.  The front broke because of it's poor design and flimsy plastic parts. So now it is just a broken dump truck. Also you have to push the button for the sounds to work. It is not motion sensitive.

 I picked this up on clearance, but I still think I spent too much.  The older versions were made of much sturdier material; the cards the questions are printed on are very flimsy compared to the original game.  The questions are okay, but many are very obscure.  Trivial Pursuit is a great game and it's one of my favorites, but this version is a dud.  Save your money if you have the older version; it's still a lot more fun to play

This item came in the mail and my 4 year old son and I were very excited.  I guess we should have read the description more carefully because I wasn't expecting so many tiny little pieces.  We used ticky tack and began the tedious process of sticking the different sized stars and such all over his room.  We waited that night to see the glowing celestial extravaganza.  We kept the light on for some time to 'charge' the glow in the dark element then turned off the light.  What we found was nothing close to amazing.  The glow was fairly dim and only lasted for a very short period of time.  We even turned a blacklight on them and all that did was make them glow a little brighter but, again, the glow only lasted about 10 -15 minutes.  I ended up going back online and buying glow in the dark paint and a star shaped sponge.  We dabbed stars all over his ceiling.  These glowing stars last most of the night and our friends and family think his room is really cool

This was given to my 2 year old as a present.  It is really cute and he loved it but it is constantly falling apart.  The roof and doors keep coming off every time it is played with.  The concept is good, all the animals and farmer are built very well, but it's frustrating to me and my son that it won't stay together.

Our son received this toy for his first birthday.  It has a lot of good features--teaches colors, numbers, farm animals and their sounds, several songs.  But the music is AWFUL--the singer is off-key on every single song (either that, or they did a bad job of matching up the music to his voice).  As someone who appreciates music, I cannot tolerate listening to this, especially since there are far better toys out there.  Since our son already has 2 LeapFrog toys which teach the same concepts as this toy (the Learning Table, which has much better quality music, and the Fridge Farm), we will be exchanging the Vtech Discovery Nursery Farm for a different toy

The beads and charms are nice enough, but for the price you get very little with this kit -- only about 50 tiny glass beads and 50 spacers, plus the charms. There's nothing here special enough to justify spending the money -- there are plenty of nicer jewelry kits out there that are more generous with the supplies

As you can see by other posts - we were all duped by a misleading advertisement.  It still shows "realistic tail movement" in the listing.  HELLO!!!  WHAT TAIL?!?!?!?!?  They have since changed the picture to the doll we all received.  The original picture showed the swimming one (tail attached).  My daughter was absolutely heartbroken when she opened this and realized this doll has no tail, nor does she swim.  I fully expect to be allowed to return this thing (opened) at no cost to myself.

I only ordered this because my child was begging for the swimming mermaid. I compared Amazon's listing with the manufacture listing and ordered. We did not get what we ordered... we got a barbie dressed in a mermaid costume, NOT the swimming one! This was from Santa and, I'm sorry, but seeing that type of disappointment in a six year old's eyes just breaks your heart. Of course, it was after the packaging was torn apart to get her out and into eager hands. For the first time in my years of shopping, I feel robbed

I did not purchase this doll from amazon, though my daughter received it as a gift--the REAL swimming mermaid.  DO NOT BUY THIS DOLL!!!  She took a bath last night with it and it did not swim!  It did not even move a bit--except for sinking to the bottom of the tub.  My daughter was ultimately disappointed and now we are going to try to take it back and get the Disney Swimming mermaid doll.  BUYER BEWARE--THIS DOLL IS NOT WHAT YOU THINK

I ordered this doll for my 3 year old grandaughter who wanted nothing else for Christmas and even though the stores were sold out, she was sure that Santa could get it for her. When my daughter called to make SURE that I had it actually in hand - I said SURE - I ordered it from Amazon!  After all, the description said that was the SWIMMING Mermaid...that it would swim as soon as you put it in the water.  IT IS NOT!!!!  Like the other lady said - it is Just another Barbie doll in a green dress.  Now I will have to pay a premium to get it from Ebay (where I could have gotten it for less a week ago) and also have to pay express shipping and hope it gets here before Christmas. I will have pay 6 times what I paid for this deception and hope that Santa can get it here in time so that my grandaughter is not disappointed.  Beware of this seller!  I see that he has now removed the word swimming from the description.  Believe me - it was there before

I had water rockets like this when I was a kid in the early 1970s.  The rockets were no different from the ones that come in this package.  They shoot high and straight and are loads of fun.

My only gripe is with the pump.  

When I was a kid, the pump was heavy plastic and metal.  The pump on these new rockets is cheap plastic.  The knob on the end broke off the first or second day.  My son and I are still able to shoot the rockets, but we have to carefully stick the knob back on each time we want to pump up a rocket.

This was big on my 8 year-old son's Christmas list, mainly because of the Ben 10 game. He even wanted it more than any other game system. Although I wasn't about to pay full price for it, we got it at about 60% off for the main console. So we got it, paid for an extra controller, the Ben 10 Game CD, and a couple of Ben 10 Booster Packs.

The unwrapping was a hit, and the excitement of the first play-through went over great with my son. But I noticed right away that it was not going to last. The game itself contains graphics from about 10 years ago. The game play is difficult, and both my son and I would find it easy to die, thus restarting the game for both of us. You can only play with the characters that happens to have come in your game or booster packs, and that's not many. (Want more? Fork out more $$$ for more booster packs.) And finally, it takes so long to load from the CD (and it has to load EVERY level) that it must be a 1x drive. Seriously slow.

Although my son still loves the IDEA of it and has not admitted he's disappointed, he does comment on how slow it is, and how he wishes he had other kids to trade the cards with so he could get more. Apparently we were the only suckers to buy it around here. It hasn't been played but maybe 4 times in the one month since Christmas.

If you notice it to be on a HUGE discount, it may be worth it. But remember, you have to pay extra for more cards. Personally, I wish we'd bought a used GameCube with a few cartridges. That has way more staying power than the HyperScan will

We've had the same set with Christmas colors for three years.  After the first year, the "whistle" unit (housed in the tender) no longer worked.  And about 10 minutes into running the second year, the engine stopped.  Found that the engine was wired so that the power wire was rubbing a drive wheel.  

The engine is built with an underpowered motor, such that a fairly high power setting is required to get it moving and then it runs fast; there is only a tiny operating range before it will fly off on a curve.  The engine is very top heavy and the curves have a tight radius to them.  Finally, when taking the entire engine apart this year found the plastic gears flimsy, badly supported and worn even with recommended oiling.  

I still have some of my fathers Lionel trains and these can still be counted on to run today; the new stuff being sold is meant to be in the trash quickly.

CHRISTMAS DAY THE TRAIN TRANSFORMER DID NOT GIVE POWER TO THE TRAIN SET.  ALL CONNECTIONS WERE VERIFIED AS WAS THE INSTRUCTION BOOKLET TO VERIFY PROPER CONNECTIONS. IT STILL DID NOT WORK.  THE ONLINE MERCHANT GAVE ONY 14 DAYS FROM DATE IT WAS SHIPPED TO RETURN FOR DEFECT, AND LIONAL WAS CLOSED FOR THE HOLIDAY UNTIL DEC 28TH.  WHEN LIONEL WAS FINALLY REACHED, THE TECH DEPARTMENT ESPECIALLY MR DEDEPPO  WERE COMPLETELY UNWILLING TO LISTEN TO THE TRAIN PROBLEMS AND ACTED COMPLETELY UNPROFESSIONAL YELLING AND SPEAKING IN A MOST AGITATED AMD UNHELPFUL MANOR.

ADDITIONAL PHONE CALLS WERE PLACED TO LIONEL AND NO PERSON WAS ABLE TO GIVE THE REQUIRED INFORMATION TO ENSURE THE PRODUCT WAS DEFECTIVE AND THEREFORE REFUNDABLE ACCORDING TO THE RETURN POLICY OF THE AMAZON.COM RETAILER.
BUYER BEWARE THE GOOD NAME OF LIONEL SEEMS TO BE A MEMORY, IN THIS INSTANCE, THE CURRENT MANUFACTURER ALLOW THEIR EMPLOYESS TO HARRASS AND THREATEN CUSTOMERS WHO SPENT A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY ON THEIR PRODUCT WITHOUT ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR DEFECT.  
I WOULD ONLY BUY A LIONAL TRAIN THAT IS EITHER VINTAGE OR MADE BY LIONEL PRIOR TO THE CURRENT OWNERSHIP

I just recently purchased the Red Variant of this figure and was excited and pleased to have both a nice looking action figure as well as the piece of Apocalypse.  But as I was setting him up, trying to move his leg it just snapped off at the hip joint. Hence the 2 star durability rating. I have never had this problem with the Legends line before, and was very disappointed, especially since it was the variant figure. Some superglue fixed the problem, but at the cost of some articulation. He is on my shelf now and looks great, but if you're giving the toy to younger children, be cautious. Like I said I have never had any problems like this with a Marvel Legends Figure before, so hopefully it was just a fluke.
The figure is still well worth getting, and in fact I am going to pick up the Green version sometime in the near future

While the kids love it, it's a headache for parents. It takes forever to inflate, even with an air compressor, thanks to many individual air chambers. As other reviewers noted, it's best not to leave it outside (the manufacturer recommends against it due to potential sun damage), but it's far too big to leave up inside the house. Not worth the time involved to set it up and take it down. I gave ours away

our daughter has had this product for quite some time and sad to say she hasnt touched it much at all. this product does get alot of attention but it is more so with reassembly. it does not swing, it does not stay together. i am constantly putting the legs back on and setting it back up and placing it with my daughters lil corner of little mommy playthings. of all the items collected, this one seems to be the one with the most problems. we do have a variety of brands varying in price from cheaper to more expensive. this one is by far the worst product we have yet purchased for her collection. we have very few dolls that actually fit in the swing and the ones that do, are too small for it. it is also the smallest item my daughter has for her dolls that range in size. we will not purchase another of these as well as recommend others to not purchase one. if the price is too good to be true, then you will only get what you paid for

First, the Volvo wagon is supposed to be scaled for the Midge series of Barbie dolls, slightly smaller than regular Barbie.
Another annoyance, it comes with a little pink roll-on suitcase full of microscopic Fisher-Price replica toys that have nothing to do with the Volvo.  I put all the tiny pieces together in the suitcase for my granddaughter and the suitcase wouldn't close. I looked on the box illustrations, and sure enough, they show a suitcase NOT CLOSED.  How could they design such a silly bunch of add-ons?  I just got rid of all that teeny-tiny stuff that doesn't relate to the inherent play value of the car.  Any kid would prefer to put her/his own stuff into a little suitcase than this mishmash of silly product promo from Fisher-Price.  Would have been nice to have a choice of colors, even approximately the REAL colors that the Volvo wagon comes in.  I just wanted my granddaughter to  be able to play-like with Grandma's white Volvo wagon.  How hard should that be?  Overall, I'm disappointed with this toy. For 28$, shipping included, I expected a better toy.  Not worth the money

When I bought this toy, I thought it was SOOOO COOL. But it really doesn't do ANYTHING it's supposed to do! It just makes annoying crying and whining noises that DO NOT sound real. Even if I tickle its tummy it just whines and cries. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT buy this toy!!!!

The idea behind this toy is great & ours has lived up to its durability claim.  My husband did not complain about adding songs to it, so it could not have been too bad.  Batteries:  this eats through them like crazy - and we used Duracell.  Volume:  the idea of volume control is good, but the highest volume is way too low.  I can't even hear anything until I get it to the mid-setting.  My 5 yr old son takes his to wrestling matches to listen while he waits his turn, but the background noise of the gym drowns out the sound in his headphones.  We probably should not have bought this until next year, maybe Fisher Price will have improved it by then

 First of all I think the concept is great however the safety bobber doesn't open and after about a dozen casts the reel fell apart. If you're looking for something that shoots, buy a rocket rocket not this rocket fishing rod and save some money. Shame on you Roland Martin for sponsoring such a piece of garbage. Don't expect to catch fish with this it is simply a novelty item

My son was so excited for this toy.  It was all he asked for on his 8th birthday. We went out to the lake this week and then began our frustration.  First there is no way to launch this 30 feet unless the wind gusts and the moon and planets are alligned. Then the "safety" bobber is so safe it doesn't even open when it hits the water, but does cause such a large ripple in the lake that all fish are gone for hours.
My son set it down after a hour of frustration and had me trek to the car to grab is old trusty fishing rod, that is not as colorful and plastic but does actually cast and catch fish. Don't get me wrong, I think the rod is a gret idea but the people who designed it did a very slipshoddy job, and I would warn anyone about spending money on it.

Like many my age, I grew up with Legos.  My wife bought this kit for me for Christmas.  I was excited.  After a couple of days of work, my excitement had turned to frustration and finally to anger.  This kit is poorly designed, and the instructions are not well thought out.  First, the "Death Star" is built on a base that you construct of Legos.  This base is not very sturdy.  The instructions said to put a bunch of parts just on one side.  Left alone, the structure would tip over because of the imbalance.  Much of the structure had such flimsy connections that the slightest thing would break connections.  I don't mean the quality of the Legos; those things are impossible to break.  I mean the way in which various bars, hinges, etc were put together.  

In the end my wife and I probably spent 40 hours building something that would not hold together. I love Legos but this kit gets nothing but ill will for me.  For lack of a better phrase, this kit sucks

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS TOY, THE BATTERY IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR THIS TOY. LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!! no where in the product discription does it tell you that the 9.6 volt battery is NOT INCLUDED, all it says, is that you will have to purchase a 9 volt battery for the remote. Don't look for the Tyco 9.6 volt battery in a store or on line, because it will be "out of stock". I have been trying to purchase one for  4 months

Bad enough that the toy is a scam that requires extra  parts.  But the surprise here is the complicity of Amazon in this misleading packaging.  This is probably why the product is unavailable suddenly and the battery charger nowhere to be found.  They know they made a mistake. If only they  would contact us each now for a full refund.
    I wish a rep from Amazon could have spent the holiday week with my family as we searched from store to store for that charger.  I wish he could have spent an afternoon of watching my child stare at the toy he waited for. ..his "big" gift

Luckily I had one of the 9.6 volt batteries around and saved myself 20 dollars, after placing the battery in which is no easy task, he has to walk behind it to get it to go, the range is terrible, why is there no antenna on the vehicle also? Too bad I threw the box away Xmas morning, now I'm out 49.99. Live and lear

My son received this car for Christmas and I was appalled. Amazon only says that it requires a 9 volt battery, which was no problem getting. But as for the 9 V Turbo battery and charger, good luck finding that. I bought it when it was on sale for $19.99 and the original price said it was $59.99, so I thought that I was getting a deal. HUGE MISTAKE! I didn't know that I would have to purchase an additional $20 battery. NO WONDER WHY IT WAS ONLY $19.99! ITs a piece of junk. I also got the batboat, but I'm afraid to see what that might need. My advice, DONT GET IT

Don't buy this price increased version.  I doesn't work any better than the $19.95 model.  Plus it uses twice the amount of batteries.  The concept is great, the graphics are great and that's the end of it.  This just like the first plug and play Ms Pacman (which I also bought) and has a joy stick issue.  If the manufacturer would take off the games that need the twisting action of the joy stick maybe this would actually be fun to play instead of frustrating.  While playing Ms Pacman which is the ONLY reason I bought these plug and plays Ms Pacman has a mind of her own, turns corners on her own and runs into the ghosts on her own.  It's impossible to use the joy stick without twisting it during play and then you're out of control.  It's extremely frustrating.  For as popular as Pacman and Ms Pacman were in their day and still are these plug and plays would sell on that merit alone so take off the games needing the turning action of the joystick

I nearly bought this until I read that it involves cardboard and stickers.  That's shameful.

Search Amazon's partners and other major booksellers for the "Nostalgia" edition of Stratego.  It runs $4 or $5 more.  It has plastic pieces with metallic paint.

This game is a blast; you and your kids are going to play it a lot

I bought this for my 6 year old after Christmas as her cousin received one and loved it.  I ran all over town trying to find the PVD's (which are hard to find a good selection of).  I ended up purchasing some online.  By the time the PVD's arrived, the player was no longer working.  We have replaced the batteries several times.  On a rare occasion, it will turn on, but that is very rare.  We are very disappointed with this unit.  I should have listened to my husband and bought the DVD player!

My 4 year old really wanted this for Christmas, after looking at similar products, we chose this one.  Should have spent the money on the one w/the DVD.  Tutu is WAY TOO SMALL - fits her 18" doll.  Mat is a little too sensitive, she tries to put her feet in the position and kicks off the music pads.  Only 2 instructions - feet up, feet down. On the other arms up, arms down.  Bar isn't very stable.  Company should save the money they spent putting in the tutu and slippers and create a more helpful mat.  My daughter will press the music button on the mat and then dance off it.

I bought two Bionicles for my son's stocking at Christmas.  He is 5 so I had to help him put them together.  It took forever to construct this sad little robot and within minutes of playing with it, it began to fall apart.  The instructions are not clear and the overall durability just stinks.  If your child just wants to construct them and display them, then this is great.  If your child wants to play with them, forget it.  Go buy a preassembled action figure and move on with your life

I ordered the Smack and Yack:Disney Cars Sally, Lightning and Ramone for Christmas.  The only one of them that worked consistently after a few minutes was Ramone.  Sally and Lightning only worked sporadically after a few minutes and then after about an hour,  they wouldn't work at all.  I ended up having to order the same ones again because my daughter was so upset that they stopped working on Christmas.  I hope the new ones work for a longer time than the orginal purchases

PROS: Very cool toy/model for a 12+ with extra time on their hands.

CONS: Too many microscopic pieces to count. 
      Very little room for open play. 
      Requires extreme caution playing with it because the propeller and other pieces fall apart at the slightest breath. 
      Not appropriate for under 7, at least. 
 
First just let me say that my son loves the Lego Duplo blocks and spends hours creating all kinds of different designs with them. He has been begging for the "big boy" Legos, and I have been turning him down, pointing out the recommended ages on the box, (knowing that I would be picking up infinite numbers of tiny pieces throughout the house for the next 18+ years). The ages they put on the box seem to be purely arbitrary, based on this particular toy. A well-meaning relative decided to bless him with this present on his 5th birthday. (I will be seeking revenge as soon as they have children.) I spent the next several hours constructing this nightmare, which in and of itself defeats the purpose of a building toy, in my opinion. I have no idea where they have the idea that this is appropriate for a 5-year-old, given that it was a challenge for me to put this together. Given the amount of microscopic pieces in this toy, one has to wonder who designs these things and if they have children of their own. So much of it seems purely sadistic.

When the helicopter was finally assembled (and I warned him that that was the one and only time I was putting it together), my son spent some time playing with it, only to be constantly frustrated by the fact that pieces were constantly popping off, particularly the propeller, and this was with very gentle play. 

Bottom line, if you have a child under 10, they would probably have many more hours of play if you just bought a lot of inexpensively priced Lego blocks (of various types) that they could make into all kinds of different designs. These expensively priced City lines and the like are really neat once built, but then it's just like a very fragile model. Once you've spent the time constructing it, you really don't want to take it apart, so I'm not really sure why you would buy this over a traditional model. I guess I miss the point.

I helped my five-year old assemble this, and, like most LEGO directions, it went together well...unfortunately, it doesn't stay together...when he tries to play with it, the tail section falls off or it breaks in the middle...not as easy to put back together once it's come apart...it's proven a real disappointment..

I just saw this today in 2 stores (both priced at 19.99), and both stores had a lot of these games, also ebay  has a ton of these going for less than $20!  This price is absolutely ridiculous!!!

Unfortunatley, I am not very techno savvy. I purchased this thinking we could use it on the original hyperscan unit...wronge. My boys told me otherwise, when they opened up the unit and hooked it up, this, being Ben 10, and the original unit being X Men, did nothing. I felt so bad for my son, he loves Ben 10 and could not even use these cards

This marble maze looks so fun and cute. However, it's actually useless and incredibly frustrating. The pieces don't fit together well and tend to fall over when you look at them--much less when you try to roll a marble through them. Also, the configurations pictured on the box don't work at all. Either our giraffe is missing a critical piece, or the wood planks are supposed to magically levitate. Ugh, I'm returning this immediately

I was dissapointed in the quality of this microphone. The sound effects are very loud and "crumbly" and the microphone itself is a bit cheap.  The microphone does not amplify the voice very loud either.  Cute to look at though

I'm here to find replacement parts for this toy.  My daughter was working really hard to try to make something work on this, and right when she got it together, one of the wires attached to the light broke off, when she tried to put it into the coil to make the connection. 

We can't solder it back in, there are no replacement parts and my daughter is crying at the kitchen table and we don't want to order another one, just to make her happy. 

Seriously, this toy is a piece of crap.  

I gave the toy high marks for educational value, because it teaches kids an important lesson.  Once corporations have your money, they don't care about whether or not you actually were able to use it, or have fun, or will need replacement parts, they only want to get MORE money off you, somehow.  

Also, buyer beware is an important lesson.

This was a real let down for my daughter.  She loves horses and has several Breyer horses.  When we saw this paddock she was so excited about it.  We decided to get it for her for Christmas.  It is very flimsy, does not stay together and breaks easily.  She spent more time trying to fix it than actually playing with it.  After a couple of weeks it was just completely not worth the effort and we put it up but later threw it away, only the doll and horses were salvagable

this was purchased for my 2 yr old son who loved to draw and scribble.  He was so excited to see thomas riding the track - well it worked the day we opened it and never again!  I would recommend not spending the money on this one and get the regular aquadoodle for 1/2 the price!  You are not able to wash the mat so if you get anything on it (eg. crayon or dirt) you can't get it out.

I consider myself a very tolerable and patient parent when it come to toys with noise, however; this phone is way too LOUD for baby/toddler.  It actually startles my 15 month old and makes him cry because it is so loud. Plus, it is powered by the wonderful button batteries that don't last. This was given as a gift, glad I didn't spend my money on it. Be aware that this phone is annoying, really serves no purpose and is too loud for babies ears

When I received the punching nun and removed her from the package, her halibut fell off, the glue holding her black cape on didn't hold either. 

I wouldn't buy another product through this company if this is the type of merchandise they are shipping.

Save your money and go to your local mall novelty store and pick one up.
